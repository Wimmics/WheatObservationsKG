"18943987","articletitle","Genetic Control of Resistance to Tan Necrosis Induced by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, Races 1 and 2, in Spring and Winter Wheat Genotypes."
"18943987","abstracttext","ABSTRACT The symptoms of tan spot of wheat, caused by Pyrenophora triticirepentis, include a tan necrosis component and an extensive chlorosis component. Since tan spot has become the major component of the leafspotting disease complex of wheat in western Canada, the need for resistant cultivars has increased. This study was conducted to determine whether the resistance to tan spot found in a diverse set of spring and winter wheat genotypes was due to resistance genes not previously reported. The genetic control of resistance to necrosis induced by P. triticirepentis race 1 and race 2 was determined, under controlled environmental conditions, for spring wheat genotypes Erik and 86ISMN 2137 and winter wheat genotypes Hadden, Red Chief, and 6B-365. Plants were inoculated at the two-leaf stage and disease reaction was assessed based on lesion type. Tests of the F(1) and F(2) generations, and of F(2:3) and F(2:8) families, indicated that one recessive gene controlled resistance to the necrosis component of tan spot caused by both race 1 and race 2 in each cross studied. Lack of segregation in crosses between the resistant cultivars indicated that the resistance gene was the same in all of the cultivars."

"19057889","abstracttext","PCR-based Landmark Unique Gene (PLUG) markers are EST-PCR markers developed based on the orthologous gene conservation between rice and wheat, and on the intron polymorphisms among the three orthologous genes derived from the A, B and D genomes of wheat. We designed a total of 960 primer sets from wheat ESTs that showed high similarity with 951 single-copy rice genes. When genomic DNA of Chinese Spring wheat was used as a template, 872 primer sets amplified one to five distinct products. Out of these 872 PLUG markers, 531 were assigned to one or more chromosomes by nullisomic-tetrasomic analysis. For each wheat chromosome, the number of loci detected ranged from 32 for chromosome 6A to 73 for chromosome 7D, with an average of 48 loci per chromosome. Several novel synteny perturbations were identified using deletion bin-mapping of markers. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PLUG markers can be used as probes to simultaneously identify BAC clones that contain homoeologous regions from all three genomes."
"16896714","articletitle","Resistance gene analogues of wheat: molecular genetic analysis of ESTs."
"16896714","abstracttext","Using two divergent nucleotide binding site (NBS) regions from wheat sequences of the NBS-LRR (leucine rich repeat) class, we retrieved 211 wheat and barley NBS-containing resistance gene analogue (RGA) expressed sequence tags (ESTs). These ESTs were grouped into 129 gene sequence groups that contained ESTs that were at least 70% identical at the DNA level over at least 200 bp. Probes were obtained for 89 of these RGA families and chromosome locations were determined for 72 of these probes using nullitetrasomic Chinese Spring wheat lines. RFLP analysis of 49 of these RGA probes revealed 65 mappable polymorphic bands in the doubled haploid Cranbrook x Halberd wheat population (C x H). These bands mapped to 49 loci in C x H. RGA loci were detected on all 21 chromosomes using the nullitetrasomic lines and on 18 chromosomes (linkage groups) in the C x H map. This identified a set of potential markers that could be developed further for use in mapping and ultimately cloning NBS-LRR-type disease resistance genes in wheat."
"19756473","articletitle","Development of wheat lines carrying stem rust resistance gene Sr39 with reduced Aegilops speltoides chromatin and simple PCR markers for marker-assisted selection."
"19756473","abstracttext","The use of major resistance genes is a cost-effective strategy for preventing stem rust epidemics in wheat crops. The stem rust resistance gene Sr39 provides resistance to all currently known pathotypes of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) including Ug99 (TTKSK) and was introgressed together with leaf rust resistance gene Lr35 conferring adult plant resistance to P. triticina (Pt), into wheat from Aegilops speltoides. It has not been used extensively in wheat breeding because of the presumed but as yet undocumented negative agronomic effects associated with Ae. speltoides chromatin. This investigation reports the production of a set of recombinants with shortened Ae. speltoides segments through induction of homoeologous recombination between the wheat and the Ae. speltoides chromosome. Simple PCR-based DNA markers were developed for resistant and susceptible genotypes (Sr39#22r and Sr39#50s) and validated across a set of recombinant lines and wheat cultivars. These markers will facilitate the pyramiding of ameliorated sources of Sr39 with other stem rust resistance genes that are effective against the Pgt pathotype TTKSK and its variants."
"19681030","articletitle","Variation in genotypic responses and biochemical analysis of callus induction in cultivated wheat."
"19681030","abstracttext","Wheat is notorious for callus induction, which is a major hindrance in direct gene transfer and consequently for genetic improvement programs. In order to provide a successful platform for gene transformation, good callus quantity and quality is important. We investigated the variation in callus induction capabilities of Pakistani wheat cultivars and measured the reducing sugar content in the induced calluses. Ten elite wheat varieties, developed and cultivated in Pakistan were selected on the basis of agronomic and stress tolerance parameters. Significant differences were found between and among wheat cultivars for callus induction response, shoot length and callus quality. The callus induction responses of Punjab-81, Punjab-96 and Zarghoon-79 were found to be the best among the 10 varieties. The induced calluses were of two types, embryogenic (hard) and non-embryogenic (soft). The seeds gave good germination. The highest reducing sugar concentration was found in cultivar Sutlaj-86, which needs to be tested for stress resistance, a measure of its utility for genetic engineering programs. The relative callus induction rate and reducing sugar content of the wheat cultivars were found to be genotype-dependent."
"22584633","articletitle","Identification of markers linked to the race Ug99 effective stem rust resistance gene Sr28 in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)."
"22584633","abstracttext","Wheat stem rust caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici can cause devastating yield losses in wheat. Over the past several decades, stem rust has been controlled worldwide through the use of genetic resistance. Stem rust race TTKSK (Ug99), first detected in Uganda in 1998, threatens global wheat production because of its unique virulence combination. As the majority of the currently grown cultivars and advanced breeding lines are susceptible to race TTKSK, sources of resistance need to be identified and characterized to facilitate their use in agriculture. South Dakota breeding line SD 1691 displayed resistance to race TTKSK in the international wheat stem rust nursery in Njoro, Kenya. Seedling screening of progeny derived from SD 1691 crossed to susceptible LMPG-6 indicated that a single resistance gene was present. Allelism and race-specificity tests indicated the stem rust resistance gene in SD 1691 was Sr28. The chromosome arm location of Sr28 was previously demonstrated to be 2BL. We identified molecular markers linked to Sr28 and validated this linkage in two additional populations. Common spring wheat cultivars in the central United States displayed allelic diversity for markers flanking Sr28. These markers could be used to select for Sr28 in breeding populations and for combining Sr28 with other stem rust resistance genes."
"21635942","articletitle","TMPIT1 from wild emmer wheat: first characterisation of a stress-inducible integral membrane protein."
"21635942","abstracttext","In this study a gene for a drought stress-inducible putative membrane protein was cloned and characterised from root tissue of wild emmer wheat. Sequence analysis indicated that the protein is a member of the widespread but hitherto uncharacterised TMPIT (transmembrane protein inducible by TNF-Î±) family, so it was labelled TdicTMPIT1. Real-time RT-PCR showed that the TdicTMPIT1 gene is upregulated on drought stress in drought-tolerant wild emmer wheat, but not in a drought-sensitive accession or in cultivated durum wheat. The TdicTMPIT1 product was predicted to be a membrane protein with four transmembrane helices. The protein was expressed and analysed in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cellular localisation of the protein in the cell was also investigated using an eGFP-tagged form of the protein in S. cerevisiae. Results obtained by confocal laser microscopy indicated that the TdicTMPIT1 tagged with GFP was localised in a membraneous compartment. It is concluded that TdicTMPIT1 is a membrane protein associated with the drought stress response in wild emmer wheat, and so it may be useful for the improvement of modern wheat genotypes. Members of this protein family in other organisms are proposed also to be involved in stress responses."

"23427606","abstracttext","Thinopyrum intermedium is a useful source of resistance genes for Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus (BYDV), one of the most damaging wheat diseases. In this study, wheat/Th. intermedium translocation lines with a BYDV resistance gene were developed using the Th. intermedium 7Ai- 1 chromosome. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), using a Th. intermedium total genomic DNA probe, enabled detection of 7Ai-1-derived small chromatins containing a BYDV resistance gene, which were translocated onto the end of wheat chromosomes in the lines Y95011 and Y960843. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analyses using 120 random 10-mer primers were conducted to compare the BYDV-resistant translocation lines with susceptible lines. Two primers amplified the DNA fragments specific to the resistant line that would be useful as molecular markers to identify 7Ai-1-derived BYDV resistance chromatin in the wheat genome. Additionally, the isolated Th. intermedium-specific retrotransposon-like sequence pTi28 can be used to identify Th. intermedium chromatin transferred to the wheat genome."

"24304553","abstracttext_background","The importance of wheat to the world economy, together with progresses in high-throughput next-generation DNA sequencing, have accelerated initiatives of genetic research for wheat improvement. The availability of high density linkage maps is crucial to identify genotype-phenotype associations, but also for anchoring BAC contigs to genetic maps, a strategy followed for sequencing the wheat genome."
"24304553","abstracttext_results","Here we report a genetic linkage map in a durum wheat segregating population and the study of mapped DArT markers. The linkage map consists of 126 gSSR, 31 EST-SSR and 351 DArT markers distributed in 24 linkage groups for a total length of 1,272Â cM. Through bioinformatic approaches we have analysed 327 DArT clones to reveal their redundancy, syntenic and functional aspects. The DNA sequences of 174 DArT markers were assembled into a non-redundant set of 60 marker clusters. This explained the generation of clusters in very small chromosome regions across genomes. Of these DArT markers, 61 showed highly significant (Expectationâ<âE-10) BLAST similarity to gene sequences in public databases of model species such as Brachypodium and rice. Based on sequence alignments, the analysis revealed a mosaic gene conservation, with 54 and 72 genes present in rice and Brachypodium species, respectively."

"24073639","articletitle","Exogenous trehalose induces defenses in wheat before and during a biotic stress caused by powdery mildew."
"24073639","abstracttext","Powdery mildew would be one of the most damaging wheat diseases without the extensive use of conventional fungicides. Some of the alternative control strategies currently emerging are based on the use of resistance inducers. The disacharride trehalose (TR) is classically described as an inducer of defenses in plants to abiotic stress. In this work, the elicitor or priming effect of TR was investigated in wheat both before and during a compatible wheat-powdery mildew interaction through molecular, biochemical, and cytological approaches. In noninoculated conditions, TR elicited the expression of genes encoding chitinase (chi, chi1, and chi4 precursor), pathogenesis-related protein 1, as well as oxalate oxidase (oxo). Moreover, lipid metabolism was shown to be altered by TR spraying via the upregulation of lipoxygenase (lox) and lipid-transfer protein (ltp)-encoding gene expression. On the other hand, the protection conferred by TR to wheat against powdery mildew is associated with the induction of two specific defense markers. Indeed, in infectious conditions following TR spraying, upregulations of chi4 precursor and lox gene expression as well as an induction of the LOX activity were observed. These results are also discussed with regard to the impact of TR on the fungal infectious process, which was shown to be stopped at the appressorial germ tube stage. Our findings strongly suggest that TR is a true inducer of wheat defense and resistance, at least toward powdery mildew."
"24196154","articletitle","Characterisation of wheat-rye recombinants with RFLP and PCR probes."
"24196154","abstracttext","The introgression of genetic material from alien species into wheat has become an important tool in modern wheat breeding. Ideally, only the trait of interest and no flanking material should be transferred. Random recombination between the genetic material is therefore of paramount importance. In a model system, we examined 17 recombinants putatively between chromosome 1D of wheat and 1R of rye with 60 random RFLP and three PCR markers. The recombinants had been generated by removing the normal effect of the Ph1 gene in the wheat background. Amongst the nine short-arm recombinants, three breakpoints were identified but no differentiation could be made between the five proximal recombinants. For the eight long-arm recombinants analysed only two breakpoints were identified with 36 markers. However, only a single RFLP marker was able to differentiate between the recombinants. Indeed the long-arm results are consistent with the possibility that only the rye telomeric region had been transferred. These results indicate either a strong clustering of the RFLP markers near the centromere or else imply that recombination induced between wheat and rye in the absence of the normal effect of the Ph1 gene occurs at only restricted sites. The results allow new primary recombinants to be selected for intercrossing to generate secondary recombinants which are expected to have a smaller interstitial rye segment than that present in DR-A1."
"24241117","articletitle","Location of genes coding isozyme markers on Aegilops umbellulata chromosomes adds data on homoeology among Triticeae chromosomes."
"24241117","abstracttext","Zymogram analysis was used to identify the Aegilops umbellulata chromosomes that carry the structural genes for particular isozymes. Wheat, Aegilops and wheat-Aegilops hybrid derivative lines (which contained identified Aegilops chromosomes) were tested by gel electrophoresis for isozymes of particular enzymes. It was found that Aegilops chromosome A (nomenclature according to G. Kimber 1967) carries a structural gene for 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, Aegilops chromosome B carries structural genes for glucose phosphate isomerase and phosphoglucose mutase, Aegilops chromosome D carries genes for leaf peroxidases, Aegilops chromosome E carries structural genes for endosperm peroxidases, acid phosphatases and leaf esterases, Aegilops chromosome F carries a gene for embryo plus scutellum peroxidases and Aegilops chromosome G carries structural genes for endosperm alkaline phosphatases, leaf alkaline phosphatases and leaf esterases. The results obtained indicate that chromosome B is partially homoeologous of the wheat chromosomes of group 1 and 4, and chromosome E is partially homoeologous of wheat chromosomes of groups 7 and 4. Circumstantial evidence is also provided about the possible association between chromosomes C, D and A of A. umbellulata respectively with chromosomes 5, 2 and 1 of wheat."
"26334764","articletitle","Altered expression of TaRSL4 gene by genome interplay shapes root hair length in allopolyploid wheat."
"26334764","abstracttext","Polyploidy is a major driving force in plant evolution and speciation. Phenotypic changes often arise with the formation, natural selection and domestication of polyploid plants. However, little is known about the consequence of hybridization and polyploidization on root hair development. Here, we report that root hair length of synthetic and natural allopolyploid wheats is significantly longer than those of their diploid progenitors, whereas no difference is observed between allohexaploid and allotetraploid wheats. The expression of wheat gene TaRSL4, an orthologue of AtRSL4 controlling the root hair development in Arabidopsis, was positively correlated with the root hair length in diploid and allotetraploid wheats. Moreover, transcript abundance of TaRSL4 homoeologue from A genome (TaRSL4-A) was much higher than those of other genomes in natural allopolyploid wheat. Notably, increased root hair length by overexpression of the TaRSL4-A in wheat led to enhanced shoot fresh biomass under nutrient-poor conditions. Our observations indicate that increased root hair length in allohexaploid wheat originated in the allotetraploid progenitors and altered expression of TaRSL4 gene by genome interplay shapes root hair length in allopolyploid wheat."
"26366114","articletitle","Puroindoline allelic diversity in Indian wheat germplasm and identification of new allelic variants."
"26366114","abstracttext","Grain hardness is an important quality trait that influences product development in wheat. This trait is governed by variation in puroindoline proteins (PINA and PINB). Our study evaluated 551 Indian wheat germplasm lines for diversity in Pina and Pinb genes. Eighty-two lines were shortlisted for full length sequencing and grain hardness studies. Sequencing studies identified six unknown alleles: two for the Pina gene and four for the Pinb gene. Five of them were novel with non-synonymous changes in the corresponding amino acid sequences. Identified mutations in the deduced mature proteins and their pre- and pro-peptides influenced the hardness characteristics of the grain. We classified these 82 varieties into different hardness categories with reference to international and Indian systems of classification. The majority of Indian wheat varieties were categorized as hard. This study revealed that unexplored Indian wheat germplasm can be a good source of genetic variability for both Pina and Pinb genes, helping in marker-assisted breeding and in obtaining wheat with different textural properties."
"25043042","articletitle","Molecular basis of adaptation to high soil boron in wheat landraces and elite cultivars."
"25043042","abstracttext","Environmental constraints severely restrict crop yields in most production environments, and expanding the use of variation will underpin future progress in breeding. In semi-arid environments boron toxicity constrains productivity, and genetic improvement is the only effective strategy for addressing the problem. Wheat breeders have sought and used available genetic diversity from landraces to maintain yield in these environments; however, the identity of the genes at the major tolerance loci was unknown. Here we describe the identification of near-identical, root-specific boron transporter genes underlying the two major-effect quantitative trait loci for boron tolerance in wheat, Bo1 and Bo4 (ref. 2). We show that tolerance to a high concentration of boron is associated with multiple genomic changes including tetraploid introgression, dispersed gene duplication, and variation in gene structure and transcript level. An allelic series was identified from a panel of bread and durum wheat cultivars and landraces originating from diverse agronomic zones. Our results demonstrate that, during selection, breeders have matched functionally different boron tolerance alleles to specific environments. The characterization of boron tolerance in wheat illustrates the power of the new wheat genomic resources to define key adaptive processes that have underpinned crop improvement."
"25775101","articletitle","Characterization of Stripe Rust Resistance in Wheat Lines with Resistance Gene Yr17 and Implications for Evaluating Resistance and Virulence."
"25775101","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, has been the most important foliar wheat disease in south central United States since 2000 when a new strain of the pathogen emerged. The resistance gene Yr17 was used by many breeding programs to develop resistant cultivars. Although Yr17 was classified as a seedling (all-stage) resistance gene conferring a low infection type, seedlings with Yr17 frequently had intermediate to high infection types when inoculated with isolates that caused little or no disease on adult plants of the same wheat lines. The objectives of this study were to determine how to best evaluate Yr17 resistance in wheat lines and to determine which factors made seedling tests involving Yr17 so variable. Stripe rust reactions on wheat seedlings with Yr17 were influenced by temperature, wheat genotype, pathogen isolate, and the leaf (first or second) used to assess the seedling reaction. The most critical factors for accurately evaluating Yr17 reactions at the seedling stage were to avoid night temperatures below 12Â°C, to use the first leaf to assess the seedling reaction, to use multiple differentials with Yr17 and known avirulent, partially virulent and virulent isolates as controls, and to recognize that intermediate infection types likely represent a level of partial virulence in the pathogen that is insufficient to cause disease on adult plants in the field."
"26074061","articletitle","TaMDAR6 acts as a negative regulator of plant cell death and participates indirectly in stomatal regulation during the wheat stripe rust-fungus interaction."
"26074061","abstracttext","We identified a new monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR) gene from wheat, designated TaMDAR6, which is differentially affected by wheat-Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) interactions. TaMDAR6 is a negative regulator of plant cell death (PCD) triggered by the Bax gene and Pst. Transcript levels of TaMDAR6 are significantly upregulated during a compatible wheat-Pst interaction, indicating that TaMDAR6 may contribute to plant susceptibility. In addition, H2 O2 production and PCD are significantly induced and initial pathogen development is significantly reduced in the TaMDAR6 knocked-down plants upon Pst infection. Thus, the suppression of TaMDAR6 enhances wheat resistance to Pst. Besides, the suppression of TaMDAR6 during an incompatible interaction induces a change in the morphology of stomata, which leads to poor stoma recognition and as a consequence to reduced infection efficiency. The percentage of infection sites that develop substomatal vesicles decreases in the TaMDAR6 knocked-down plants during the incompatible interaction presumably due to the increase in ROS accumulation, which is likely to activate other resistance mechanisms that have a negative effect on substomatal vesicle formation. TaMDAR6 can therefore be considered a negative regulator of PCD and of wheat defense to Pst."
"27091738","articletitle","Abscisic acid metabolic genes of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.): identification and insights into their functionality in seed dormancy and dehydration tolerance."
"27091738","abstracttext_main conclusion","The three homeologues of wheat NCED2 were identified; the wheat NCED2A and CYP707A1B affect seed ABA level and dormancy but not leaf ABA level and transpirational water loss in Arabidopsis. Biosynthesis and catabolism of abscisic acid (ABA) in plants are primarily regulated by 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases (NCEDs) and ABA 8'-hydroxylase (ABA8'OH), respectively. The present study identified the complete coding sequences of a second NCED gene, designated as TaNCED2, and its homeologues (TaNCED2A, TaNCED2B and TaNCED2D) in hexaploid wheat, and characterized its functionality in seed dormancy and leaf dehydration tolerance using the TaNCED2A homeologue. The study also investigated the role of the B genome copy of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase 707A1 (CYP707A1) gene of hexaploid wheat (TaCYP707A1B), which encodes ABA8'OH, in regulating the two traits as this has not been studied before. Ectopic expression of TaNCED2A and TaCYP707A1B in Arabidopsis resulted in altered seed ABA level and dormancy with no effect on leaf ABA content and transpirational water loss. To gain insights into the physiological roles of TaNCED2 and TaCYP707A1 in wheat, the study examined their spatiotemporal expression patterns and determined the genomic contributions of transcripts to their total expression."
"27741295","articletitle","Influence of Gene Expression on Hardness in Wheat."
"27741295","abstracttext","Puroindoline (Pina and Pinb) genes control grain texture or hardness in wheat. Wild-type/soft alleles lead to softer grain while a mutation in one or both of these genes results in a hard grain. Variation in hardness in genotypes with identical Pin alleles (wild-type or mutant) is known but the molecular basis of this is not known. We now report the identification of wheat genotypes with hard grain texture and wild-type/soft Pin alleles indicating that hardness in wheat may be controlled by factors other than mutations in the coding region of the Pin genes. RNA-Seq analysis was used to determine the variation in the transcriptome of developing grains of thirty three diverse wheat genotypes including hard (mutant Pin) and soft (wild type) and those that were hard without having Pin mutations. This defined the role of pin gene expression and identified other candidate genes associated with hardness. Pina was not expressed in hard wheat with a mutation in the Pina gene. The ratio of Pina to Pinb expression was generally lower in the hard non mutant genotypes. Hardness may be associated with differences in Pin expression and other factors and is not simply associated with mutations in the PIN protein coding sequences."

"29321790","abstracttext","The seed dormancy characteristic is regarded as one of the most critical factors for pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) resistance. As a wild wheat relative species, Aegilops tauschii is a potential genetic resource for improving common wheat. In this study, an advanced backcross population (201 strains) containing only Ae. tauschii segments was developed by means of synthetic octaploid wheat (hexaploid wheat Zhoumai 18 Ã Ae. tauschii T093). Subsequently, seed dormancy rate (Dor) in the advanced backcross population was evaluated on the day 3, 5 and 7, in which 2 major QTLs ( QDor-2D and QDor-3D ) were observed on chromosomes 2D and 3D with phenotypic variance explained values (PVEs) of 10.25 and 20.40%, respectively. Further investigation revealed significant correlation between QDor-3D and Tamyb10 gene, while no association was found between the former and TaVp1 gene, implying that QDor-3D site could be of closer position to Tamyb10 . The obtained quantitative trait locus sites (QTLs) in this work could be applied to develop wheat cultivars with PHS resistance."
"28881438","articletitle","Host-induced gene silencing of an important pathogenicity factor PsCPK1 in Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici enhances resistance of wheat to stripe rust."
"28881438","abstracttext","Rust fungi are devastating plant pathogens and cause a large economic impact on wheat production worldwide. To overcome this rapid loss of resistance in varieties, we generated stable transgenic wheat plants expressing short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting potentially vital genes of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). Protein kinase A (PKA) has been proved to play important roles in regulating the virulence of phytopathogenic fungi. PsCPK1, a PKA catalytic subunit gene from Pst, is highly induced at the early infection stage of Pst. The instantaneous silencing of PsCPK1 by barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV)-mediated host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) results in a significant reduction in the length of infection hyphae and disease phenotype. These results indicate that PsCPK1 is an important pathogenicity factor by regulating Pst growth and development. Two transgenic lines expressing the RNA interference (RNAi) construct in a normally susceptible wheat cultivar displayed high levels of stable and consistent resistance to Pst throughout the T 3 to T 4 generations. The presence of the interfering RNAs in transgenic wheat plants was confirmed by northern blotting, and these RNAs were found to efficiently down-regulate PsCPK1 expression in wheat. This study addresses important aspects for the development of fungal-derived resistance through the expression of silencing constructs in host plants as a powerful strategy to control cereal rust diseases."

"32121459","abstracttext","Wheat stripe rust is a severe threat of almost all wheat-growing regions in the world. Being an obligate biotrophic fungus, Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( PST ) produces new virulent races that break the resistance of wheat varieties. In this study, 115 progeny isolates were generated through sexual reproduction on susceptible Himalayan Berberis pseudumbellata using a dominant Pakistani race (574232) of PST . The parental isolate and progeny isolates were characterized using 24 wheat Yr single-gene lines and ten simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. From the one-hundred-and-fifteen progeny isolates, 25 virulence phenotypes (VPs) and 60 multilocus genotypes were identified. The parental and all progeny isolates were avirulent to Yr5 , Yr10 , Yr15 , Yr24 , Yr32 , Yr32 , YrSp , YrTr1 , YrExp2 , Yr26 , and YrTye and virulent to Yr1 , Yr2 , Yr6 , Yr7 , Yr8 , Yr9 , Yr17 , Yr25 , Yr27 , Yr28 , YrA , Yr44 , and Yr3 . Based on the avirulence/virulence phenotypes, we found that VPs virulent to Yr1 , Yr2 , Yr9 , Yr17 , Yr47 , and YrA were controlled by one dominant gene; those to YrSp , YrTr1 , and Yr10 by two dominant genes; and those to YrExp2 by two complementary dominant genes. The results are useful in breeding stripe rust-resistant wheat varieties and understanding virulence diversity."
"32293996","articletitle","Identification of Stripe Rust Resistance Genes in Common Wheat Cultivars From the Huang-Huai-Hai Region of China."
"32293996","abstracttext","Wheat stripe (yellow) rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ), is a serious fungal disease worldwide, especially in the Huang-Huai-Hai region, a main wheat production area in China. Gene postulation, molecular testing, and pedigree analysis were conducted to determine the presence of stripe rust resistance genes to 15 Pst races in 66 selected commercial wheat cultivars released from 2000 to 2016. In addition, races CYR32, CYR33, and CYR34 were used to evaluate resistance to Pst at the adult-plant stage of wheat in the field. Four Yr genes ( Yr9 , Yr10 , Yr26 , and Yr32 ) were postulated in 24 wheat cultivars either singly or in combination. Thirty-six cultivars might contain unknown Yr genes, whereas no identified Yr gene was postulated in six cultivars. Yr9 was detected at a frequency of 28.8%, and no cultivars carried Yr5 , Yr15 , or Yr18 . Ten cultivars (15.2%) exhibited adult-plant resistance in the field tests with three predominant races. Three cultivars (Langyan 43, Xinong 889, and Yunfeng 139) had all-stage resistance. These results are useful to growers selecting cultivars and to breeders aiming to use more resistance genes to develop new cultivars with effective resistance in order to reduce stripe rust damage."
"32609938","articletitle","A WRKY transcription factor, TaWRKY40-D, promotes leaf senescence associated with jasmonic acid and abscisic acid pathways in wheat."
"32609938","abstracttext","Leaf senescence is a complex and precise regulatory process that is correlated with numerous internal and environmental factors. Leaf senescence is tightly related to the redistribution of nutrients, which significantly affects productivity and quality, especially in crops. Evidence shows that the mediation of transcriptional regulation by WRKY transcription factors is vital for the fine-tuning of leaf senescence. However, the underlying mechanisms of the involvement of WRKY in leaf senescence are still unclear in wheat. Using RNA sequencing data, we isolated a novel WRKY transcription factor, TaWRKY40-D, which localizes in the nucleus and is basically induced by the progression of leaf senescence. TaWRKY40-D is a promoter of natural and dark-induced leaf senescence in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana and wheat. We also demonstrated a positive response of TaWRKY40-D in wheat upon jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Consistent with this, the detached leaves of TaWRKY40-D VIGS (virus-induced gene silencing) wheat plants showed a stay-green phenotype, while TaWRKY40-D overexpressing Arabidopsis plants showed premature leaf senescence after JA and ABA treatment. Moreover, our results revealed that TaWRKY40-D positively regulates leaf senescence, possibly by altering the biosynthesis and signalling of JA and ABA pathway genes. Together, our results suggest a new regulator of JA- and ABA-related leaf senescence, as well as a new candidate gene that can be used for molecular breeding in wheat."

"32503498","abstracttext_background","As functional proteins, dehydrins are found in many maturing seeds and vegetable tissues under adverse environmental conditions. However, the regulation of dehydrin expression remains unclear."
"32503498","abstracttext_results","In this study, a novel drought stress-related bHLH transcription factor, TabHLH49, was isolated from a wheat cDNA library treated with the drought and cold stress by using yeast one-hybrid system. TabHLH49 protein possesses a typical conserved bHLH domain and is a Myc-type bHLH transcription factor. TabHLH49 was detected in the nucleus of tobacco epidermal cells, and the amino acid sequences at the C-terminus (amino acids 323-362) is necessary for its transactivation activity. Real-time PCR analyses revealed the tissue-specific expression and drought stress-responsive expression of TabHLH49 in wheat. In addition, the verification in Y1H and electrophoretic mobility shift assays illustrated that TabHLH49 protein can bind and interact with the promoter of the wheat WZY2 dehydrin. Furthermore, the dual-luciferase assays showed that TabHLH49 can positively regulate the expression of WZY2 dehydrin. The transient expression and BSMV-mediated gene silencing of TabHLH49 also showed that TabHLH49 positively regulates the expression of WZY2 dehydrin and improves drought stress resistance in wheat."

"32480859","abstracttext","CC-type glutaredoxins comprise a large land plant-specific class of oxidoreductases. Previous research shows roles for two such proteins in developmental processes in Arabidopsis; ROXY1 mediates petal initiation and morphogenesis, and ROXY1 and ROXY2 are required for normal anther development. In the present work, the broader glutaredoxin family was investigated in hexaploid wheat with bioinformatic methods, revealing a large and multifunctional gene family. With a PCR based method, three wheat ROXY homeoalleles were isolated. Complementation analyses show that these three isoforms fully complemented the roxy1 mutation in Arabidopsis. Further, yeast two-hybrid experiments demonstrate that one such wheat ROXY protein interacts strongly with TGA3, an Arabidopsis TGA transcription factor previously shown to associate with ROXY1. Deletion analyses show that TaROXY-Î±3 docks to a glutamine rich region of TGA3, a putative transcriptional activation domain. These results suggest a conserved molecular role of Arabidopsis and wheat ROXY proteins in inflorescence/spike development, most likely in the post-translational regulation of TGA proteins including HBP-1b (the wheat PERIANTHIA orthologue), which likely exerts also a developmental function by activating histone gene transcription in highly proliferating tissues such as the SAM and root tip."

"30261151","abstracttext","Powdery mildew is a destructive foliar disease of wheat worldwide. Wheat cultivar Tian Xuan 45 exhibits resistance to the highly virulent isolate HY5. Genetic analysis of the F 2 and F 2:3 populations of a cultivar Ming Xian 169/Tian Xuan 45 cross revealed that the resistance to HY5 was controlled by a single recessive gene, temporarily designated as PmTx45 . A Manhattan plot with the relative frequency distribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was used to rapidly narrow down the possible chromosomal regions of the associated genes. This microarray-based bulked segregant analysis (BSA) largely improved traditional analytical methods. PmTx45 was located in chromosomal bin 4BL5-0.86-1.00 and was flanked by SNP marker AX-110673642 and intron length polymorphism (ILP) marker ILP-4B01G269900 with genetic distances of 3.0 and 2.6 cM, respectively. Molecular detection in a panel of wheat cultivars using the markers linked to PmTx45 showed that the presence of PmTx45 in commercial wheat cultivars was rare. Resistance spectrum and chromosomal position analyses indicated that PmTx45 may be a novel recessive gene with moderate powdery mildew resistance. This new microarray-based BSA method is feasible and effective and has the potential application for mapping genes in wheat in marker-assisted breeding."

"31851310","abstracttext","In view of their key roles in many soil- and plant-related processes, we hypothesized that soil microorganisms could play a larger role in determining wheat baking quality than nitrogen fertilization. A field experiment was conducted under bread wheat production conditions, where different fertilization treatments, ranging from 0-120Â kg/ha NH4NO3, were applied. Soil samples were taken in May, June and July. Functional genes in the nitrogen cycle were quantified and amplicons of the 16S rRNA gene and the ITS region were sequenced. Wheat yields were measured, and the grain baking quality was analysed for each plot. Fertilisation did not significantly influence the yields and the grain quality. Many bacterial and fungal Amplicon Sequence Variants showed significant positive or negative correlations with yield and grain baking quality parameters. Among the functional gene quantified, the archaeal amoA showed strong negative correlations with the wheat yields and many grain and flour quality parameters. Regression models were able to explain up to 81% of the variability in grain quality based on the microbial data from the May sampling. A better understanding of the microbiology of wheat fields could lead to an optimized management of the N fertilization to maximize yields and grain quality."

"31433275","abstracttext","The coexistence of cereal cyst nematode (CCN) species Heterodera avenae and H. filipjevi , often involving multiple pathotypes, is a limiting factor for wheat production in China. Some of the known genes for resistance to CCN are not effective against both nematode species, hence complicating breeding efforts to develop CCN-resistant wheat cultivars. Here, we demonstrate that the CCN resistance in wheat cultivar Madsen to both Heterodera spp. is controlled by different genetic loci, both of which originated from Aegilops ventricosa . A new quantitative trait locus (QTL), QCre-ma7D , was identified and localized in a 3.77-Mb genomic region on chromosome arm 7DL, which confers resistance to H. filipjevi . QCre-ma2A on chromosome arm 2AS corresponds to CCN resistance gene Cre5 and confers resistance to H. avenae . This QTL is a new locus on chromosome arm 7DL and is designated Cre9 . Three Kompetitive allele-specific PCR markers (BS00150072, BS00021745, and BS00154302) were developed for molecular marker-assisted selection of Cre9 and locally adapted wheat lines with resistance to both nematode species were developed. QCre-ma2A on chromosome arm 2AS corresponds to CCN resistance gene Cre5 and confers resistance to H. avenae . The identification of different loci underlying resistance to H. filipjevi and H. avenae and the development of adapted resistant entries will facilitate breeding of wheat cultivars that are resistant to these devastating nematodes in China."

Chemical pesticides are currently the main control method but have an inevitable negative consequence on the environment and in food safety. This research studies a promising substitute, Streptomyces pratensis S10, which was isolated from tomato leaf mould and shows a significant inhibition effect on F. graminearum based on antagonism assays. The biocontrol mechanism is studied by enhanced green fluorescent protein labelling, quantitative real-time PCR, the Doskochilova 8 solvents system test and complete genome sequencing. Strain S10 can colonize in the wheat root, control wheat scab and decrease deoxynivalenol (DON) content. The control effects in vitro, planta and the plot experiments were 92.86%, 68.67% and 40.87% to 86.62%, respectively. S10 decreased DON content by inhibiting the mycelium growth and DON synthesis gene expression. The active substances of the S10 secondary metabolites had a high-temperature resistance and 29 putative biosynthetic gene clusters in its genome. The S10 control mechanism is multivariate, which shows potential in controlling wheat scab."

"25522166","abstracttext","Wheat hybrid necrosis is an interesting genetic phenomenon that is found frequently and results in gradual death or loss of productivity of wheat. However, the molecular basis and mechanisms of this genetic phenomenon are still not well understood. In this study, the transcriptomes of wheat hybrid necrosis F1 and its parents (Neimai 8 and II469) were investigated using digital gene expression (DGE). A total of 1300 differentially expressed genes were identified, indicating that the response to hybrid necrosis in wheat is complicated. The assignments of the annotated genes based on Gene Ontology (GO) revealed that most of the up-regulated genes belong to ""universal stress related"", ""DNA/RNA binding"", ""protein degradation"" functional groups, while the down-regulated genes belong to ""carbohydrate metabolism"" and ""translation regulation"" functional groups. These findings suggest that these pathways were affected by hybrid necrosis. Our results provide preliminarily new insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms of hybrid necrosis and will help to identify important candidate genes involved in wheat hybrid necrosis."

"25697954","abstracttext","RAR1 and SGT1 are important co-chaperones of Hsp90. We previously showed that TaHsp90.1 is required for wheat seedling growth, and that TaHsp90.2 and TaHsp90.3 are essential for resistance (R) gene mediated resistance to stripe rust fungus. Here, we report the characterization of TaRAR1 and TaSGT1 genes in bread wheat. TaRAR1 and TaSGT1 each had three homoeologs, which were located on wheat groups 2 and 3 chromosomes, respectively. Strong inhibition of seedling growth was observed after silencing TaSGT1 but not TaRAR1. In contrast, decreasing the expression of TaRAR1 or TaSGT1 could all compromise R gene mediated resistance to stripe rust fungus infection. Protein-protein interactions were found among TaRAR1, TaSGT1 and TaHsp90. The N-terminus of TaHsp90, the CHORD-I and CHORD-II domains of TaRAR1 and the CS domain of TaSGT1 may be instrumental for the interactions among the three proteins. Based on this work and our previous study on TaHsp90, we speculate that the TaSGT1-TaHsp90.1 interaction is important for maintaining bread wheat seedling growth. The TaRAR1-TaSGT1-TaHsp90.2 and TaRAR1-TaSGT1-TaHsp90.3 interactions are involved in controlling the resistance to stripe rust disease. The new information obtained here should aid further functional investigations of TaRAR1-TaSGT1-TaHsp90 complexes in regulating bread wheat growth and disease resistance."

"16044268","abstracttext","Wheat scab (Fusarium Head Blight, FHB) is a destructive disease in the warm and humid wheat-growing areas of the world. Finding diverse sources of FHB resistance is critical for genetic diversity of resistance for wheat breeding programs. Leymus racemosus is a wild perennial relative of wheat and is highly resistant to FHB. Three wheat- L. racemosus disomic addition (DA) lines DA 5 Lr#1, DA 7 Lr#1 and DALr.7 resistant to FHB were used to develop wheat- L.racemosus translocation lines through irradiation and gametocidal gene-induced chromosome breakage. A total of nine wheat-alien translocation lines with wheat scab resistance were identified by chromosome C-banding, GISH, telosomic pairing and RFLP analyses. In line NAU 614, the long arm of 5 Lr#1 was translocated to wheat chromosome 6B. Four lines, NAU 601, NAU 615, NAU 617, and NAU 635, had a part of the short arm of 7 Lr#1 transferred to different wheat chromosomes. Four other lines, NAU 611, NAU 634, NAU 633, and NAU 618, contained translocations involving Leymus chromosome Lr.7 and different wheat chromosomes. The resistance level of the translocation lines with a single alien chromosome segment was higher than the susceptible wheat parent Chinese Spring but lower than the alien resistant parent L. racemosus. At least three resistance genes in L. racemosus were identified. One was located on chromosome Lr.7, and two could be assigned to the long arm of 5 Lr#1 and the short arm of 7 Lr#1."

"31720702","abstracttext_key message","A total of 12 QTL conferring resistance to tan spot induced by a race 2 isolate, 86-124, were identified in three tetraploid wheat mapping populations. Durum is a tetraploid species of wheat and an important food crop. Tan spot, caused by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr), is a major foliar disease of both tetraploid durum wheat and hexaploid bread wheat. Understanding the Ptr-wheat interaction and identifying major QTL can facilitate the development of resistant cultivars and effectively mitigate the negative effect of this disease. Over 100 QTL have already been discovered in hexaploid bread wheat, whereas few mapping studies have been conducted in durum wheat. Utilizing resistant resources and identifying novel resistant loci in tetraploid wheat will be beneficial for the development of tan spot-resistant durum varieties. In this study, we evaluated four interconnected tetraploid wheat populations for their reactions to the race 2 isolate 86-124, which produces Ptr ToxA. Tsn1, the wheat gene that confers sensitivity to Ptr ToxA, was not associated with tan spot severity in any of the four populations. We found a total of 12 tan spot-resistant QTL among the three mapping populations. The QTL located on chromosomes 3A and 5A were detected in multiple populations and co-localized with race-nonspecific QTL identified in other mapping studies. Together, these QTL can confer high levels of resistance and can be used for the improvement in tan spot resistance in both hexaploid bread and durum wheat breeding. Two QTL on chromosomes 1B and 7A, respectively, were found in one population when inoculated with a ToxA knockout strain 86-124ÎToxA only, indicating that their association with tan spot was induced by other unidentified necrotrophic effectors, but under the absence of Ptr ToxA. In addition to removal of the known dominant susceptibility genes, integrating major race-nonspecific resistance loci like the QTL identified on chromosome 3A and 5A in this study could confer high and stable tan spot resistance in durum wheat."

"12416629","abstracttext","Precise location and nature of each of 14 length mutations detected among chloroplast DNAs of Triticum-Aegilops species by RFLP analysis were determined at the nucleotide sequence level. Each mutation was compared with at least three non-mutated wild-type plastomes as standards. These 14 length mutations were classified into 4 duplications and 10 deletions. One duplication occurred in the small single-copy region close to the border of the inverted repeat, and the remaining 13 length mutations took place in the large single-copy region. All length mutations occurred in the intergenic regions, suggesting that these length mutations do not affect plastid gene expression. Saltatory replication was the cause of all duplications, whereas intramolecular recombination mediated by short direct repeats played a substantial role in the deletions. Recurrent occurrences of certain deletion events were found in some AT-rich regions, which constituted hot spots for deletion. Out of four hypervariable regions detected among the grass plastomes, two (downstream of rbcL and a tRNA gene accumulated region) were still active after differentiation of Triticum and Aegilops complex."

Sequences from the Ns genome represented the highest nucleotide diversity values for both polyploid and diploid species with Ï=0.03343 and Î¸=0.03536 for polyploid Ns genome sequences and Ï=0.03886 and Î¸=0.03886 for diploid Psathyrostachys sequences, while Triticum urartu represented the lowest diversity among diploid species at Ï=0.0011 and Î¸=0.0011. Nucleotide variation of diploid Aegilops speltoides (Ï=0.2441, presumed the B genome donor of Triticum species) is five times higher than that (Ï=0.00483) of B genome in polyploid species. Significant negative Tajima's D values for the St, A(u), and D genomes along with high rates of polymorphisms and low sequence diversity were observed. Origins of the A(u), B, and D genomes were linked to T. urartu, A. speltoides, and A. tauschii, respectively.

"24253624","abstracttext","Studies were made on the genetic determination of androgenetic plant yield and its two components: embryo production and green plant regeneration. This involved the analysis of a complete 7Ã7 diallel cross of 4 androgenetic lines and 3 lines obtained by pedigree selection, one of them having the Triticum timopheevi cytoplasm. The three traits analysed are both heritable and environmentally influenced (by season and culture medium composition). The analysis of embryo production shows a mainly nuclear inheritance, with predominantly additive gene action, but also a favourable effect of Triticum timopheevi cytoplasm. Green plant regeneration has a more complex genetic determination, with additive as well as non-additive gene action and cytoplasmic influences. Hybrids appear superior to inbred lines for embryogenesis and green plant yield, but not for green plant regeneration. Androgenetic lines used as parents did not show superiority over other parents either in their own value or in the transmission of androgenetic abilities. Genetic improvement seems to be possible by recombination in progenies of hybrids between lines having complementary abilities."
"7968490","articletitle","The use of chloroplast DNA to resolve plant phylogenies: noncoding versus rbcL sequences."
"7968490","abstracttext","Direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products is now an expanding area of plant systematics and evolution. Within angiosperms the rbcL gene has been widely sequenced and used for inferring plant phylogenies at higher taxonomic levels. Unfortunately rbcL does not usually contain enough information to resolve relationships between closely related genera, such as Hordeum, Triticum, and Aegilops. One solution to this problem could be to analyze noncoding regions of chloroplast DNA, which are supposed to evolve more rapidly than coding regions. Here we present pairwise comparisons among dicots and monocots for rbcL and two noncoding sequences of cpDNA (the trnL (UAA) intron and the intergenic spacer between the trnL (UAA) 3' exon and the trnF (GAA) gene). It appears that these regions evolve faster (more than three times faster, on average) than rbcL, as previously reported, and that the trnL intron evolves at a rate that is the same as that of the intergenic spacer. By the analysis of these regions, the genera Hordeum, Triticum, and Aegilops clearly could be distinguished. A phylogeny using trnL (UAA) intron sequences is also inferred for some species of the genus Gentiana L., clearly illustrating the phylogenetic utility of these zones at the generic level. The advantages and the disadvantages of the use of these regions to resolve plant phylogenies are discussed, as well as the desirability of a preliminary study before every large-scale analysis."
"26973683","articletitle","Avirulence Genes in Cereal Powdery Mildews: The Gene-for-Gene Hypothesis 2.0."
"26973683","abstracttext","The gene-for-gene hypothesis states that for each gene controlling resistance in the host, there is a corresponding, specific gene controlling avirulence in the pathogen. Allelic series of the cereal mildew resistance genes Pm3 and Mla provide an excellent system for genetic and molecular analysis of resistance specificity. Despite this opportunity for molecular research, avirulence genes in mildews remain underexplored. Earlier work in barley powdery mildew (B.g. hordei) has shown that the reaction to some Mla resistance alleles is controlled by multiple genes. Similarly, several genes are involved in the specific interaction of wheat mildew (B.g. tritici) with the Pm3 allelic series. We found that two mildew genes control avirulence on Pm3f: one gene is involved in recognition by the resistance protein as demonstrated by functional studies in wheat and the heterologous host Nicotiana benthamiana. A second gene is a suppressor, and resistance is only observed in mildew genotypes combining the inactive suppressor and the recognized Avr. We propose that such suppressor/avirulence gene combinations provide the basis of specificity in mildews. Depending on the particular gene combinations in a mildew race, different genes will be genetically identified as the ""avirulence"" gene. Additionally, the observation of two LINE retrotransposon-encoded avirulence genes in B.g. hordei further suggests that the control of avirulence in mildew is more complex than a canonical gene-for-gene interaction. To fully understand the mildew-cereal interactions, more knowledge on avirulence determinants is needed and we propose ways how this can be achieved based on recent advances in the field."

"29262777","abstracttext_background","The NAM-B1 gene in wheat has for almost three decades been extensively studied and utilized in breeding programs because of its significant impact on grain protein and mineral content and pleiotropic effects on senescence rate and grain size. First detected in wild emmer wheat, the wild-type allele of the gene has been introgressed into durum and bread wheat. Later studies have, however, also found the presence of the wild-type allele in some domesticated subspecies. In this study we trace the evolutionary history of the NAM-B1 in tetraploid wheat species and evaluate it as a putative domestication gene."

"31219637","abstracttext","Grain size and weight are important components of a suite of yield-related traits in crops. Here, we showed that the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing of TaGW7, a homolog of rice OsGW7 encoding a TONNEAU1-recruiting motif (TRM) protein, affects grain shape and weight in allohexaploid wheat. By editing the TaGW7 homoeologs in the B and D genomes, we showed that mutations in either of the two or both genomes increased the grain width and weight but reduced the grain length. The effect sizes of mutations in the TaGW7 gene homoeologs coincided with the relative levels of their expression in the B and D genomes. The effects of gene editing on grain morphology and weight traits were dosage dependent with the double-copy mutant showing larger effect than the respective single copy mutants. The TaGW7-centered gene co-expression network indicated that this gene is involved in the pathways regulating cell division and organ growth, also confirmed by the cellular co-localization of TaGW7 with Î±- and Î²-tubulin proteins, the building blocks of microtubule arrays. The analyses of exome capture data in tetraploid domesticated and wild emmer, and hexaploid wheat revealed the loss of diversity around TaGW7-associated with domestication selection, suggesting that TaGW7 is likely to play an important role in the evolution of yield component traits in wheat. Our study showed how integrating CRISPR-Cas9 system with cross-species comparison can help to uncover the function of a gene fixed in wheat for allelic variants targeted by domestication selection and select targets for engineering new gene variants for crop improvement."

It possesses a unique sequence which is composed of three FKPB-like domains, in addition to a putative tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motif and a calmodulin-binding site. The recombinant FKBP-PPIase expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli exhibits PPIase activity that is efficiently inhibited by the immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and rapamycin. Northern blot analysis showed that wheat FKBP was found mainly in young tissues. Polyclonal antibodies revealed the presence of cross-reacting proteins in embryos, roots and shoots.

More advanced breeding approaches using quantitative disease resistance genes and resistance gene pyramids are being used to combat wheat stem rust and other diseases, though widespread adoption of these breeding methodologies is needed to maintain resistance efficacy. Advances in understanding the molecular basis of plant disease resistance at both host and nonhost levels offers further possibilities for stem rust resistance using biotechnological approaches. However, truly durable resistance to wheat stem rust and other phytopathogens seems an unlikely prospect in the face of continually evolving pathogen populations."
"15012551","articletitle","Genetics of resistance to wheat leaf rust."
"15012551","abstracttext","Leaf rust (caused by Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici) is the most widespread and regularly occurring rust on wheat. Genetic resistance is the most economical method of reducing yield losses due to leaf rust. To date, 46 leaf rust resistance genes have been designated and mapped in wheat. Resistance gene expression is dependent on the genetics of host-parasite interaction, temperature conditions, plant developmental stage, and interaction between resistance genes with suppressors or other resistance genes in the wheat genomes. Genes expressed in seedling plants have not provided long-lasting effective leaf rust resistance. Adult-plant resistance genes Lr13 and Lr34 singly and together have provided the most durable resistance to leaf rust in wheat throughout the world. Continued efforts to isolate, characterize, and map leaf rust resistance genes is essential given the ability of the leaf rust fungus to overcome deployed resistance genes."

"17521361","abstracttext","Rhizosphere inhabitants interact intricately with plant host. Bacillus cereus 905 isolated from wheat rhizosphere colonized wheat rhizosphere with large population size. In this work, the role of superoxide dismutases (SODs) of B. cereus 905 in surviving in wheat rhizosphere was analyzed. Two genes, sodA-1 and sodA-2 encoding two distinct manganese SODs (MnSODs), were isolated from the bacterium. The amino acid sequence similarity between the two peptides is 58.43%. Through homologous recombination, three mutant strains have been created, each lacking either sodA-1, sodA-2 or both. Analysis of these mutant strains revealed differences in transcription and enzymatic activity of SOD. MnSOD2, encoded by sodA-2, plays a more important role in antioxidative stress. MnSOD1, the product of sodA-1 gene, is expressed at lower level. The function of the two MnSODs appears to be essential in colonization of wheat rhizosphere."

"24241800","abstracttext","One-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of reduced total protein extracts from the endosperm of hexaploid wheat revealed a new set of faintly-stained bands, having slower electrophoretic mobility than the high-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenin subunits. These new bands have been termed the E group of glutenin subunits. Analysis of aneuploid stocks of Chinese Spring wheat has shown that three of the E bands, in order of increasing electrophoretic mobility, are controlled by genes on the short arms of chromosomes 1B, 1A and 1D, respectively. The E bands are expressed only in the presence of the long arm of chromosome 1B indicating an interaction between two or more genes involved in their production in wheat endosperm. The gene on the short arm of chromosome 1D controlling an E subunit recombined freely with Tri-D1 and the centromere but not at all with Gli-D1, indicating additional complexity at the Gli-DI locus in wheat."

"24203020","abstracttext","A series of hexaploid wheat lines containing zero, two or four doses of rye chromosome arm 1RS was used to investigate the response to changes in dosage by the rye genes when in a wheat background. The quantity of protein produced by the secalin protein genes contained on 1RS was directly related to the number of copies of 1RS present in the line. No response could be detected by representative wheat proteins suggesting that the increase in secalin protein observed was due to an increase in mRNA produced when four copies of the secalin gene was present. These results suggest that increasing the dosage of alien genes introgressed into wheat may be a useful tool for enhancing their expression.Mention of a trade name or proprietary product does not constitute a guarantee, warranty or recommendation of the product by the U.S. Department of Agriculture or the University of Missouri and does not imply its approval to the exclusion of other products that may be suitable."

"24172932","abstracttext","As initial step in the transfer of dwarf bunt resistance from barley into wheat, the two cereal crops were hybridized. Using the wheat cultivars 'Fukuhokomugi' and 'Chinese Spring' (AABBDD genomes) as female parents and barley cultivar 'Luther' (II genome) as male, we synthesized 9 euploid hybrids (2n = 4x = 28; ABDI genomes). The hybrids were vigorous, but highly sterile. Meiotic analyses of seven hybrids showed considerable variation in chromosome pairing. Of the hybrids involving 'Fukuhokomugi' 3 had high pairing with a mean of 5.08-6.72 chiasmata per cell, while others had 2.16-3.52 chiasmata per cell. As many as 12 bivalents in some pollen mother cells would suggest at least some pairing between wheat and barley chromosomes. This level of homoeologous pairing, coupled with some, albeit low, female fertility of the F1 hybrids, could offer an opportunity for intergeneric gene transfers from barley into wheat and vice versa."

"25035499","abstracttext","The allohexaploid bread wheat genome consists of three closely related subgenomes (A, B, and D), but a clear understanding of their phylogenetic history has been lacking. We used genome assemblies of bread wheat and five diploid relatives to analyze genome-wide samples of gene trees, as well as to estimate evolutionary relatedness and divergence times. We show that the A and B genomes diverged from a common ancestor ~7 million years ago and that these genomes gave rise to the D genome through homoploid hybrid speciation 1 to 2 million years later. Our findings imply that the present-day bread wheat genome is a product of multiple rounds of hybrid speciation (homoploid and polyploid) and lay the foundation for a new framework for understanding the wheat genome as a multilevel phylogenetic mosaic."

Nowadays, the diversity of these old species lies frozen in gene banks and rare attempts aim to exploit them as a source for genetic diversity in modern wheat breeding. Here, we want to raise a debate on a more holistic exploitation of ancient species via their direct introduction to the consumer market as high quality products. Although exemplified only for ancient wheat species, this innovative self-financing strategy can be directly extended to other species. A central requirement for this concept is intensive communication, coordination, and interdisciplinary research along the entire production chain from farm to fork."

"27283646","abstracttext","With this work, it is intended to propose a novel approach based on high resolution melting (HRM) analysis to detect wheat and discriminate it from other gluten-containing cereals. The method consisted of a real-time PCR assay targeting the gene encoding for the germ agglutinin isolectin A protein (Tri a 18 allergen), using the fluorescent Evagreen dye combined with HRM analysis. The results enabled wheat differentiation from other phylogenetically related cereals, namely barley, rye and oat with high level of confidence. Additionally, a quantitative real-time PCR approach was proposed, allowing detecting and quantifying wheat down to 20mg/kg in rice flour and 20pg of wheat DNA (â¼1.1 DNA copies). Its application was successfully achieved in the analysis of processed foods to verify labelling compliance, being considered as a cost-effective tool for the specific detection of cereals in gluten-free foods."

Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the wheat strains were explored and compared. A total of 5907 and 6287 non-synonymous SNVs were acquired for Yunong 201 and 3114, respectively. A total of 4021 genes with SNVs were obtained. The genes that underwent non-synonymous SNVs were significantly involved in ATP binding, protein phosphorylation, and cellular protein metabolic process. The heat map analysis also indicated that most of these mutant genes were significantly differentially expressed at different developmental stages. The SNVs in these genes possibly contribute to the longer kernel length of Yunong 3114. Our data provide useful information on wheat transcriptome for future studies on wheat functional genomics. This study could also help in illustrating the gene functions of the non-synonymous SNVs of Yunong 201 and 3114."

"29343669","abstracttext","The wheat florigen gene Wheat FLOWERING LOCUS T (WFT, which is identical to VRN3) is an integrator of the vernalization, photoperiod and autonomous pathways in wheat flowering. Many studies have indicated that VERNALIZATION 1 (VRN1) directly or indirectly up-regulates WFT expression in leaves. VRN1 encodes an APETALA1/FRUITFULL-like MADS box transcription factor that is up-regulated by vernalization and aging, leading to promotion of flowering. In this study, the VRN1 protein was expressed as a His-Tag fusion protein in Escherichia coli and used in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The results from the EMSA indicated that the VRN1 protein directly binds to the CArG-box in the promoter region of WFT, suggesting the direct up-regulation of WFT by VRN1 in the leaves of wheat plants."

In this study, the effects of foliar melatonin application during recovery on the cold tolerance of cold primed wheat plants were investigated. It was found that both melatonin and cold priming increased the photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance, enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and altered the related gene expressions in wheat under cold stress. Melatonin application is helpful for the photosynthetic carbon assimilation and membrane stability of the cold primed plants under cold stress. These results suggested that foliar melatonin application during recovery enhanced the cold priming induced tolerance to subsequent low temperature stress in wheat."

"28829898","abstracttext","One of the limiting factors in using dominant markers is the unique amplification of the target fragment. Therefore, failures in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or non-amplifications can be interpreted as an absence of the allele. The possibility of false negatives implies in reduced efficiency in the selection process in genetic breeding programs besides the loss of valuable genetic material. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the viability of a microsatellite marker as an internal amplification control with a dominant marker for the wheat Glu1-Dx5 gene. A population of 77 wheat cultivars/breeding lines was analyzed. Fourteen microsatellite markers were analyzed in silico regarding the formation of dimers and clamps. The biplex reaction conditions were optimized, and the Xbarc117 marker was selected as the internal amplification control with a Glu1-Dx5 marker in wheat. It was concluded that the Xbarc117 microsatellite marker was effective in the simultaneous amplification with a dominant Glu1-Dx5 marker, making biplex PCR viable in wheat for the studied markers."

One line, named E82, showed outstanding nutritional properties, with very low immunogenic gluten and a low stimulation capacity of T-cells from celiac patients. Moreover, a clinical trial with non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) patients showed that the consumption of bread made with this E82 low gliadin line induced positive changes in the gut microbiota composition."

"31696258","abstracttext","Fusarium pseudograminearum is an important pathogen of Fusarium crown rot and Fusarium head blight, which is able to infect wheat and barley worldwide, causing great economic losses. Transcription factors (TFs) of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) protein family control important processes in all eukaryotes. In this study, we identified a gene, designated FpAda1, encoding a bZIP TF in F. pseudograminearum. The homolog of FpAda1 is also known to affect hyphal growth in Neurospora crassa. Deletion of FpAda1 in F. pseudograminearum resulted in defects in hyphal growth, mycelial branching and conidia formation. Pathogenicity assays showed that virulence of the Îfpada1 mutant was dramatically decreased on wheat coleoptiles and barley leaves. However, wheat coleoptile inoculation assay showed that Îfpada1 could penetrate and proliferate in wheat cells. Moreover, the FpAda1 was required for abnormal nuclear morphology in conidia and transcription of FpCdc2 and FpCdc42. Taken together, these results indicate that FpAda1 is an important transcription factor involved in growth and development in F. pseudograminearum."

"28234909","abstracttext","The first step of the benzoxazinoid (BX) synthesis pathway is catalyzed by an enzyme with indole-3-glycerol phosphate lyase activity encoded by 3 genes, Bx1, TSA and Igl. A gene highly homologous to maize and wheat Bx1 has been identified in rye. The goal of the study was to analyze the gene and to experimentally verify its role in the rye BX biosynthesis pathway as a rye ortholog of the Bx1 gene. Expression of the gene showed peak values 3 days after imbibition (dai) and at 21 dai it was undetectable. Changes of the BX content in leaves were highly correlated with the expression pattern until 21 dai. In plants older than 21 dai despite the undetectable expression of the analyzed gene there was still low accumulation of BXs. Function of the gene was verified by correlating its native expression and virus-induced silencing with BX accumulation. Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV)-based vectors were used to induce transcriptional (TGS) and posttranscriptional (PTGS) silencing of the analyzed gene. Both strategies (PTGS and TGS) significantly reduced the transcript level of the analyzed gene, and this was highly correlated with lowered BX content. Inoculation with virus-based vectors specifically induced expression of the analyzed gene, indicating up-regulation by biotic stressors. This is the first report of using the BSMV-based system for functional analysis of rye gene. The findings prove that the analyzed gene is a rye ortholog of the Bx1 gene. Its expression is developmentally regulated and is strongly induced by biotic stress. Stable accumulation of BXs in plants older than 21 dai associated with undetectable expression of ScBx1 indicates that the function of the ScBx1 in the BX biosynthesis is redundant with another gene. We anticipate that the unknown gene is a putative ortholog of the Igl, which still remains to be identified in rye."

"28981698","abstracttext","Differences in gene content are a significant source of variability within species and have an impact on phenotypic traits. However, little is known about the mechanisms responsible for the most recent gene gains and losses. We screened the genomes of 123 worldwide isolates of the major pathogen of wheat Zymoseptoria tritici for robust evidence of gene copy number variation. Based on orthology relationships in three closely related fungi, we identified 599 gene gains and 1,024 gene losses that have not yet reached fixation within the focal species. Our analyses of gene gains and losses segregating in populations showed that gene copy number variation arose preferentially in subtelomeres and in proximity to transposable elements. Recently lost genes were enriched in virulence factors and secondary metabolite gene clusters. In contrast, recently gained genes encoded mostly secreted protein lacking a conserved domain. We analyzed the frequency spectrum at loci segregating a gene presence-absence polymorphism in four worldwide populations. Recent gene losses showed a significant excess in low-frequency variants compared with genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism, which is indicative of strong negative selection against gene losses. Recent gene gains were either under weak negative selection or neutral. We found evidence for strong divergent selection among populations at individual loci segregating a gene presence-absence polymorphism. Hence, gene gains and losses likely contributed to local adaptation. Our study shows that microbial eukaryotes harbor extensive copy number variation within populations and that functional differences among recently gained and lost genes led to distinct evolutionary trajectories."

"18943046","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Stripe rust is one of the most important diseases of wheat and barley worldwide. On wheat it is caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici and on barley by P. striiformis f. sp. hordei Most wheat genotypes are resistant to P. striiformis f. sp. hordei and most barley genotypes are resistant to P. striiformis f. sp. tritici. To determine the genetics of resistance in wheat to P. striiformis f. sp. hordei, crosses were made between wheat genotypes Lemhi (resistant to P. striiformis f. sp. hordei) and PI 478214 (susceptible to P. striiformis f. sp. hordei). The greenhouse seedling test of 150 F(2) progeny from the Lemhi x PI 478214 cross, inoculated with race PSH-14 of P. striiformis f. sp. hordei, indicated that Lemhi has a dominant resistance gene. The single dominant gene was confirmed by testing seedlings of the F(1), BC(1) to the two parents, and 150 F(3) lines from the F(2) plants with the same race. The tests of the F(1), BC(1), and F(3) progeny with race PSH-48 of P. striiformis f. sp. hordei and PST-21 of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici also showed a dominant gene for resistance to these races. Cosegregation analyses of the F(3) data from the tests with the two races of P. striiformis f. sp. hordei and one race of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici suggested that the same gene conferred the resistance to both races of P. striiformis f. sp. hordei, and this gene was different but closely linked to Yr21, a previously reported gene in Lemhi conferring resistance to race PST-21 of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici. A linkage group consisting of 11 resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) markers was established for the genes. The gene was confirmed to be on chromosome 1B by amplification of a set of nullitetrasomic Chinese Spring lines with an RGAP marker linked in repulsion with the resistance allele. The genetic information obtained from this study is useful in understanding interactions between inappropriate hosts and pathogens. The gene identified in Lemhi for resistance to P. striiformis f. sp. hordei should provide resistance to barley stripe rust when introgressed into barley cultivars."

"20838759","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat worldwide. Growing resistant cultivars is the most effective approach to control the disease, but only a few genes confer effective all-stage resistance against the current populations of the pathogen worldwide. It is urgent to identify new genes for diversifying sources of resistance genes and for pyramiding genes for different types of resistance in order to achieve high levels of durable resistance for sustainable control of stripe rust. The common spring wheat genotype 'PI 181434', originally from Afghanistan, was resistant in all greenhouse and field tests in our previous studies. To identify the resistance gene(s) PI 181434 was crossed with susceptible genotype 'Avocet Susceptible'. Adult plants of 103 F(2) progeny were tested in the field under the natural infection of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici. Seedlings of the parents, F(2) and F(3) were tested with races PST-100 and PST-127 of the pathogen under controlled greenhouse conditions. The genetic study showed that PI 181434 has a single dominant gene conferring all-stage resistance. Resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) techniques were used to identify molecular markers linked to the gene. A linkage map of 8 RGAP and 2 SSR markers was constructed for the gene using data from the 103 F(2) plants and their derived F(3) lines tested in the greenhouse. Amplification of the complete set of nulli-tetrasomic lines and selected ditelosomic lines of Chinese Spring with an RGAP marker and the two SSR markers mapped the gene on the long arm of chromosome 3D. Because it is the first gene for stripe rust resistance mapped on chromosome 3DL and different from all previously named Yr genes, the gene in PI 181434 was designated Yr45. Polymorphism rates of the two closest flanking markers, Xwgp115 and Xwgp118, in 45 wheat genotypes were 73.3 and 82.2%, respectively. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the eight wheat genotypes sharing both flanking markers. The RGAP markers and potential SNP markers should be useful in incorporating the gene into wheat cultivars and in pyramiding it with other genes for durable resistance."

To understand the molecular underpinning of the ectomycorrhizal truffle lifestyle, we compared the genomes of Piedmont white truffle (Tuber magnatum), PÃ©rigord black truffle (Tuber melanosporum), Burgundy truffle (Tuber aestivum), pig truffle (Choiromyces venosus) and desert truffle (Terfezia boudieri) to saprotrophic Pezizomycetes. Reconstructed gene duplication/loss histories along a time-calibrated phylogeny of Ascomycetes revealed that Tuberaceae-specific traits may be related to a higher gene diversification rate. Genomic features in Tuber species appear to be very similar, with high transposon content, few genes coding lignocellulose-degrading enzymes, a substantial set of lineage-specific fruiting-body-upregulated genes and high expression of genes involved in volatile organic compound metabolism. Developmental and metabolic pathways expressed in ectomycorrhizae and fruiting bodies of T. magnatum and T. melanosporum are unexpectedly very similar, owing to the fact that they diverged ~100 Ma. Volatile organic compounds from pungent truffle odours are not the products of Tuber-specific gene innovations, but rely on the differential expression of an existing gene repertoire. These genomic resources will help to address fundamental questions in the evolution of the truffle lifestyle and the ecology of fungi that have been praised as food delicacies for centuries."

"15918008","abstracttext","The use of major resistance genes is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing stem rust epidemics in Australian wheat crops. The long-term success of this strategy is dependent on combining resistance genes that are effective against all predominant races of the pathogen, a task greatly assisted by the use of molecular markers linked to individual resistance genes. The wheat stem rust resistance genes Sr24 and Sr26 (derived from Agropyron elongatum) and SrR and Sr31 (derived from rye) are available in wheat as segments of alien chromosome translocated to wheat chromosomes. Each of these genes provides resistance to all races of wheat stem rust currently found in Australia . We have developed robust PCR markers for Sr24 and Sr26 (this study) and SrR and Sr31 (previously reported) that are applicable across a wide selection of Australian wheat germplasm. Wheat lines have recently become available in which the size of the alien segments containing Sr26, SrR and Sr31 has been reduced. Newly developed PCR-markers can be used to identify the presence of the shorter alien segment in all cases. Assuming that these genes have different gene-for-gene specificities and that the wheat industry will discourage the use of varieties carrying single genes only, the newly developed PCR markers will facilitate the incorporation of two or more of the genes Sr24, Sr26, SrR and Sr31 into wheat lines and have the potential to provide durable control to stem rust in Australia and elsewhere."

"16158239","abstracttext","Bread wheat is an allohexaploid with genome composition AABBDD. Phytochrome C is a gene involved in photomorphogenesis that has been used extensively for phylogenetic analyses. In wheat, the PhyC genes are single copy in each of the three homoeologous genomes and map to orthologous positions on the long arms of the group 5 chromosomes. Comparative sequence analysis of the three homoeologous copies of the wheat PhyC gene and of some 5 kb of upstream region has demonstrated a high level of conservation of PhyC, but frequent interruption of the upstream regions by the insertion of retroelements and other repeats. One of the repeats in the region under investigation appeared to have inserted before the divergence of the diploid wheat genomes, but was degraded to the extent that similarity between the A and D copies could only be observed at the amino acid level. Evidence was found for the differential presence of a foldback element and a miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) 5' to PhyC in different wheat cultivars. The latter may represent the first example of an active MITE family in the wheat genome. Several conserved non-coding sequences were also identified that may represent functional regulatory elements. The level of sequence divergence (Ks) between the three wheat PhyC homoeologs suggests that the divergence of the diploid wheat ancestors occurred some 6.9 Mya, which is considerably earlier than the previously estimated 2.5-4.5 Mya. Ka/Ks ratios were <0.15 indicating that all three homoeologs are under purifying selection and presumably represent functional PhyC genes. RT-PCR confirmed expression of the A, B and D copies. The discrepancy in evolutionary age of the wheat genomes estimated using sequences from different parts of the genome may reflect a mosaic origin of some of the Triticeae genomes."

"27148345","abstracttext","Polyphenols in whole grain wheat have potential health benefits, but little is known about the expression patterns of phenolic acid biosynthesis genes and the accumulation of phenolic acid compounds in different-colored wheat grains. We found that purple wheat varieties had the highest total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity. Among phenolic acid compounds, bound ferulic acid, vanillic, and caffeic acid levels were significantly higher in purple wheat than in white and red wheat, while total soluble phenolic acid, soluble ferulic acid, and vanillic acid levels were significantly higher in purple and red wheat than in white wheat. Ferulic acid and syringic acid levels peaked at 14 days after anthesis (DAA), whereas p-coumaric acid and caffeic acid levels peaked at 7 DAA, and vanillic acid levels gradually increased during grain filling and peaked near ripeness (35 DAA). Nine phenolic acid biosynthesis pathway genes (TaPAL1, TaPAL2, TaC3H1, TaC3H2, TaC4H, Ta4CL1, Ta4CL2, TaCOMT1, and TaCOMT2) exhibited three distinct expression patterns during grain filling, which may be related to the different phenolic acids levels. White wheat had higher phenolic acid contents and relatively high gene expression at the early stage, while purple wheat had the highest phenolic acid contents and gene expression levels at later stages. These results suggest that the expression of phenolic acid biosynthesis genes may be closely related to phenolic acids accumulation."

"27792757","abstracttext","Stem rust is one of the most potentially harmful wheat diseases, but has been effectively controlled in China since 1970s. However, the interest in breeding wheat with durable resistance to stem rust has been renewed with the emergence of Ug99 (TTKSK) virulent to the widely used resistance gene Sr31, and by which the wheat stem rust was controlled for 40 years in wheat production area worldwide. Yunnan Province, located on the Southwest border of China, is one of the main wheat growing regions, playing a pivotal role in the wheat stem rust epidemic in China. This study investigated the levels of resistance in key wheat cultivars (lines) of Yunnan Province. In addition, the existence of Sr25, Sr26, Sr28, Sr31, Sr32, and Sr38 genes in 119 wheat cultivars was assessed using specific DNA markers. The results indicated that 77 (64.7%) tested wheat varieties showed different levels of resistance to all the tested races of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici. Using molecular markers, we identified the resistance gene Sr31 in 43 samples; Sr38 in 10 samples; Sr28 in 12 samples, and one sample which was resistant against Ug99 (avirulent to Sr32). No Sr25 or Sr26 (effective against Ug99) was identified in any cultivars tested. Furthermore, 5 out of 119 cultivars tested carried both Sr31 and Sr38 and eight contained both Sr31 and Sr28. The results enable the development of appropriate strategies to breed varieties resistant to stem rust."

"28983310","abstracttext","Agropyron cristatum , which is a wild grass of the tribe Triticeae, grows widely in harsh environments and provides many desirable genetic resources for wheat improvement. However, unclear interspecific phylogeny and genome-wide variation has limited the utilization of A. cristatum in the production of superior wheat varieties. In this study, by sequencing the transcriptome of the representative tetraploid A. cristatum Z559 and the common wheat variety Fukuhokomugi (Fukuho), which are often used as parents in a wide cross, their phylogenetic relationship and interspecific variation were dissected. First, 214,854 transcript sequences were assembled, and 3,457 orthologous genes related to traits of interest were identified in A. cristatum . Second, a total of 72 putative orthologous gene clusters were used to construct phylogenetic relationships among A. cristatum , Triticeae and other genomes. A clear division between A. cristatum and the other Triticeae species was revealed. Third, the sequence similarity of most genes related to traits of interest is greater than 95% between A. cristatum and wheat. Therefore, using the 5% mismatch parameter for A. cristatum , we mapped the transcriptome sequencing data to wheat reference sequences to discover the variations between A. cristatum and wheat and 862,340 high-quality variants were identified. Additionally, compared with the wheat A and B genomes, the P and D genomes displayed an obviously larger variant density and a longer evolutionary distance, suggesting that A. cristatum is more distantly related to the wheat D genome. Finally, by using Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR array (KASPar) technology, 37 of 53 (69.8%) SNPs were shown to be genuine in Z559, Fukuho, and additional lines with seven different P chromosomes, and function of the genes in which these SNPs are located were also determined. This study provides not only the first insights into the phylogenetic relationships between the P genome and Triticeae but also genetic resources for gene discovery and specific marker development in A. cristatum , and this information will be vital for future wheat-breeding efforts.

"30627606","articletitle","Transcriptome data of cultivated tetraploid and hexaploid wheat variety during grain development."
"30627606","abstracttext","Wheat is a major food crop and an important component of human diet throughout the world. There are two major types of cultivated wheat; one is tetraploid durum (pasta) wheat and another one is hexaploid bread wheat. Wheat grain is the reservoir of two major dietary components - carbohydrate and protein, which get accumulated during seed maturation and directly affects yield and quality. Hexaploid, having 6 copies of each chromosome differs to a great extent from tetraploid having 4 copies of each chromosome. Studying the gene expression pattern in developing grain would help in understanding the difference in metabolic process as well as involvement of the genes in these two types of wheat. A transcriptional comparison of developing grains was carried out between the two wheat genotypes; tetraploid (AABB:PDW233) and hexaploid (AABBDD:PBW343) using RNA-seq. Approximately 194 million raw reads were obtained from both libraries. After removal of contaminations, a huge proportion (>99%), of high quality reads were obtained, were aligned to reference genome. A total of 2324 up-regulated and 522 down-regulated genes were identified as differentially expressed between PDW233 vs PBW343. Gene ontology annotation and enrichment analysis gave further information about differentially expressed genes between durum and bread wheat. This information will help in understanding process grain reserve in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat in relation to their nutritional quality."

"31881925","abstracttext_background","Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by the fungus Fusarium graminearum Schwabe and stripe rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici are devastating diseases that affect wheat production worldwide. The use of disease-resistant genes and cultivars is the most effective means of reducing fungicide applications to combat these diseases. Elymus repens (2nâ=â6xâ=â42, StStStStHH) is a potentially useful germplasm of FHB and stripe rust resistance for wheat improvement."
"31881925","abstracttext_results","Here, we report the development and characterization of two wheat-E. repens lines derived from the progeny of common wheat-E. repens hybrids. Cytological studies indicated that the mean chromosome configuration of K15-1192-2 and K15-1194-2 at meiosis were 2nâ=â42â=â0.86 Iâ+â17.46 II (ring)â+â3.11 II (rod) and 2nâ=â42â=â2.45 Iâ+â14.17 II (ring)â+â5.50 II (rod)â+â0.07 III, respectively. Genomic and fluorescence in situ hybridization karyotyping and simple sequence repeats markers revealed that K15-1192-2 was a wheat-E. repens 3D/?St double terminal chromosomal translocation line. Line K15-1194-2 was identified as harboring a pair of 7DS/?StL Robertsonian translocations and one 3D/?St double terminal translocational chromosome. Further analyses using specific expressed sequence tag-SSR markers confirmed that the wheat-E. repens translocations involved the 3St chromatin in both lines. Furthermore, compared with the wheat parent Chuannong16, K15-1192-2 and K15-1194-2 expressed high levels of resistance to FHB and stripe rust pathogens prevalent in China."

"31969895","abstracttext","Cross-kingdom RNA interference (RNAi) has been shown to play important roles during plant-pathogen interactions, and both plants and pathogens can use small RNAs (sRNAs) to silence genes in each other. This bidirectional cross-kingdom RNAi was still unexplored in the wheat- Zymoseptoria tritici pathosystem. Here, we performed a detailed analysis of the sRNA bidirectional crosstalk between wheat and Z. tritici . Using a combination of small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) and microRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq), we were able to identify known and novel sRNAs and study their expression and their action on putative targets in both wheat and Z. tritici . We predicted the target genes of all the sRNAs in either wheat or Z. tritici transcriptome and used degradome analysis to validate the cleavage of these gene transcripts. We could not find any clear evidence of a cross-kingdom RNAi acting by mRNA cleavage in this pathosystem. We also found that the fungal sRNA enrichment was lower in planta than during in vitro growth, probably due to the lower expression of the only Dicer gene of the fungus during plant infection. Our results support the recent finding that Z. tritici sRNAs cannot play important roles during wheat infection. However, we also found that the fungal infection induced wheat sRNAs regulating the expression of specific wheat genes, including auxin-related genes, as an immune response. These results indicate a role of sRNAs in the regulation of wheat defenses during Z. tritici infection. Our findings contribute to improve our understanding of the interactions between wheat and Z. tritici ."

"1445935","abstracttext","Gibberellic acid (GA3) brought about a 3-fold stimulation of AdoMet synthetase activity in wheat aleurones. At the qualitative level, three isozymes of AdoMet synthetase were observed by DE-52 chromatography in GA3-treated wheat aleurones. In contrast, the control wheat aleurones showed a single isozyme. Thus the phytohormone (GA3, 1 microM) induced two additional isozymes of AdoMet synthetase in wheat aleurones. The activity of all the three isozymes in GA3-treated aleurones was considerably decreased by the simultaneous presence of abscisic acid (ABA, 10 microM). Cycloheximide (20 micrograms/ml) also significantly lowered the levels of the three isozymes of AdoMet synthetase in Ga3-treated aleurones, thereby suggesting the requirement of de-novo protein synthesis for the complete induction of isozymes. However, wheat aleurones excised from embryonated wheat seeds, did not require the application of GA3 for the induction of two additional isozymes of AdoMet synthetase. Apparently, the transport of GA3 from the embryo to aleurones induced two new isozymes of AdoMet synthetase. Three isozymes of AdoMet synthetase were also observed in wheat embryos excised from germinated wheat grains, without exogenous application of GA3. The molecular weight of all the three isozymes of AdoMet synthetase in wheat system is 181,000. The molecular weight of the subunit of the enzyme is 84,000. The dimeric nature of AdoMet synthetase was established by SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified enzyme. In-vitro hybridization of two flanking isozymic peaks I and III by NaCl-freeze-thaw method resulted in the appearance of an additional middle activity peak (isozyme II). However, no additional isozymic peaks were generated when isozymic peaks I and III were individually given a freeze-thaw treatment. Thus the flanking isozymic peaks I and III represent homodimers that differed in their net charge. In contrast, the middle isozymic activity peak II, when subjected to NaCl-freeze-thaw treatments yielded two additional isozymic peaks, I and III, thereby suggesting its heterodimeric nature. We envisage that the three isozymes in GA3-treated wheat aleurone layers are formed by the random dimerization of two classes of enzyme subunits. The two enzyme subunits which differ in their net charge could be the product of two genes of AdoMet synthetase (SAM1 and SAM2). Based on this assumption, we propose that a single isozyme I in water imbibed control wheat aleurones is the product of SAM1 gene of AdoMet synthetase. The occurrence of three isozymes in GA3-treated aleurones could be ascribed to the expression of an alternate gene of AdoMet synthetase (SAM2 gene).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

"7651330","abstracttext","In Nicotiana sylvestris, two cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) mutants obtained by protoplast culture show abnormal developmental features of both vegetative and reproductive organs, and mitochondrial gene reorganization following homologous recombination between 65 bp repeated sequences. A mitochondrial region of 16.2 kb deleted from both CMS mutants was found to contain the last two exons of the nad7 gene coding for a subunit of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, which is encoded in the nucleus in fungi and animals but was recently found to be encoded by the mitochondrial genome in wheat. Although the N. sylvestris nad7 gene shows strong homology with its wheat counterpart, it contains only three introns instead of four. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments indicated that the parental gene organization, including the complete nad7 gene, is probably maintained at a substoichiometric level in the CMS mutants, but this proportion is too low to have a significant physiological role, as confirmed by expression studies showing the lack of detectable amounts of the NAD7 polypeptide. Consequently, absence of NAD7 is not lethal to plant cells but a deficiency of complex I could be involved in the abnormal CMS phenotype."
"8929399","articletitle","Loss of RNA editing of rps1 sequences in Oenothera mitochondria."
"8929399","abstracttext","We have analysed a region downstream from the atp9 gene in Oenothera mitochondrial DNA which contains an open reading frame of 224 codons. This open reading frame, designated orf224, is co-transcribed with the atp9 gene. In wheat mitochondria, a homologous reading frame (orf174) has been described which is considerably shorter at the N-terminus compared to the putative Oenothera gene. The deduced polypeptides from both species show high similarity to the N-terminal third of ribosomal protein S1 of bacteria. Transcripts of orf174 are edited in wheat mitochondria whereas the similarly conserved cytidine positions in orf224 mRNAs of Oenothera are silent. On the other hand, atp9 sequences, which are located upstream on the same co-transcript, are fully edited. Because of this, we conclude that editing sites are selected independently for mRNA sections. Our results suggest that orf224 represents a transcribed pseudogene in Oenothera. The active gene for a functional ribosomal protein S1 for mitochondria is therefore expected to be present in the nucleus. A nuclear localization for this gene is likewise suggested for Arabidopsis due to the fact that rps1 sequences are absent from the mitochondrial genome."

"9829825","abstracttext","Single-subunit RNA polymerases belonging to the T3/T7 bacteriophage family are thought to be common throughout eukaryotes. We report the isolation and characterization of a nucleus-encoded single-subunit RNA polymerase gene from maize. This gene is highly homologous to other single-subunit RNA polymerase genes from Arabidopsis, Chenopodium. yeast and Neurospora crassa involved in organellar transcription. Genomic Southern analysis reveals 10 to 15 hybridising fragments, suggesting that maize contains a small gene family. The isolated gene contains 19 exons and its genomic structure is highly conserved when compared to the three Arabidopsis homologues. Unlike the case in Arabidopsis, intron-12 of the maize bacteriophage-type RNA polymerase gene is alternatively spliced. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the resultant alternatively spliced transcript represents approximately 21 to 26% of the total polymerase mRNA in maize coleoptiles. The orthologous wheat bacteriophage-type RNA polymerase is also alternatively spliced and the intron exhibits 78% identity to maize intron-12. The conservation in alternative splicing between wheat and maize and its absence from Arabidopsis suggest a functional requirement for the alternatively spliced product."

A genomic library of B. adolescentis DSM20083 was screened for the presence of the axhD3 gene. Two plasmids were identified containing part of the axhD3 gene. The nucleotide sequences were combined and three open reading frames (ORFs) were found. The first ORF showed high homology with xylanases belonging to family 8 of the glycoside hydrolases and this gene was designated xylA. The second ORF was the axhD3 gene belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 43. The third (partial) ORF coded for a putative carboxylesterase. The axhD3 gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Several substrates were employed in the biochemical characterization of recombinant AXHd3. The enzyme showed the highest activity toward wheat arabinoxylan oligosaccharides. In addition, beta-xylanase from Trichoderma sp. was able to degrade soluble wheat arabinoxylan polymer to a higher extent, after pretreatment with recombinant AXHd3. Arabinoxylan oligosaccharides incubated with a combination of recombinant AXHd3 and an alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase from Aspergillus niger did not result in a higher maximal release of arabinose than incubation with these enzymes separately."

"15368856","abstracttext","A 750 bp DNA fragment from the genome of Penicillium nordicum was isolated using degenerated primers for polyketide synthase genes. All analyzed P. nordicum strains possessed the fragment, whereas the closely related ochratoxinogenic P. verrucosum strains did not. The nucleotide sequence of the fragment has been determined. It shows homology to the pksL2 polyketide synthase gene from A. parasiticus. The deduced amino acid sequence of this fragment shows high homology to several other fungal polyketide synthases. An expression analysis of this gene by Reverse Transcription Real Time PCR demonstrates that this putative polyketide synthase gene (otapksPN) is highly induced under ochratoxin A producing conditions, but only to low levels under non-producing conditions. A Real Time PCR system based on the otapksPN sequence has been used to monitor growth and ochratoxin A production of P. nordicum in wheat. A strong correlation between the copy numbers of the otapksPN gene and the colony forming units (cfu) has been observed. In addition there was a strong congruence between otapksPN gene expression and ochratoxin A production in wheat. According to these results the fragment is obviously part of a polyketide synthase (otapksPN) which seems to be involved in the production of ochratoxin A."

"15014874","abstracttext","Segregation analysis of resistance to powdery mildew in a F(2) progeny from the cross Chinese Spring (CS) x TA2682c revealed the inheritance of a dominant and a recessive powdery mildew resistance gene. Selfing of susceptible F(2) individuals allowed the establishment of a mapping population segregating exclusively for the recessive resistance gene. The extracted resistant derivative showing full resistance to each of 11 wheat powdery mildew isolates was designated RD30. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis of bulked segregants from F(3)s showing the homozygous susceptible and resistant phenotypes revealed an AFLP marker that was associated with the recessive resistance gene in repulsion phase. Following the assignment of this AFLP marker to wheat chromosome 7A by means of CS nullitetrasomics, an inspection of simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci evenly spaced along chromosome 7A showed that the recessive resistance gene maps to the distal region of chromosome 7AL. On the basis of its close linkage to the Pm1 locus, as inferred from connecting partial genetic maps of 7AL of populations CS x TA2682c and CS x Virest ( Pm1e), and its unique disease response pattern, the recessive resistance gene in RD30 was considered to be novel and tentatively designated mlRD30."

"19138233","abstracttext","The best characterized form of resistance is gene-for-gene resistance. Less well characterized is nonhost resistance in which an entire plant species is resistant to an entire pathogen species. Here, different rice genotypes were inoculated with host and nonhost strains of Magnaporthe isolated from rice, wheat and crabgrass. The different types of interactions were characterized at a cytological level using a 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) stain to investigate the occurrence of reactive oxygen intermediates or by observing the occurrence of cellular autofluorescence. Gene expression of a set of selected PR-genes was analysed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Inoculation with the isolate from crabgrass resulted in a lack of penetration. The wheat isolate induced a hypersensitive response with varying degrees of pathogen growth inside the invaded cell according to the rice genotype. Expression analysis of our PR-gene set revealed clear differences between the different types of interactions in both kinetic and magnitude of gene induction. Our integrated study opens the way to the dissection of molecular components leading to nonhost reactions to Magnaporthe grisea in rice and points to novel sources of durable resistance to fungal plant pathogens in other cereal crops."

"17502899","abstracttext","Two sequence-tagged site (STS) markers for the wheat yellow rust resistance (R) gene Yr5 have been derived through the identification and characterization of linked amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). The sequences of the 2 AFLP markers partially overlap with one another, but belong to discrete loci: S19M93-140 completely cosegregates with Yr5, whereas S23M41-310 maps at a distance of 0.7 cM. The DNA sequence of S23M41-310 shows significant homology with the 3' end of nucleotide-binding site (NBS) - leucine-rich repeat (LRR) - type R-genes, in particular with orthologues of the rice bacterial blight R-gene Xa-I. The distinct genetic location of the 2 AFLP loci suggests that Yr5 falls within an R-gene cluster. Because neither sequence forms part of a detectable transcription product, we propose that the Yr5 R-gene cluster includes R-gene analogues and pseudogenes. A Yr5 flanking simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker has also been identified, which allows Yr5 to be effectively incorporated, along with other R-genes for yellow rust, into elite wheat genetic backgrounds, through marker-assisted selection."

"19888824","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight of wheat, caused by Fusarium graminearum, is a serious disease resulting in both reduced yields and contamination of grain with trichothecene toxins, with severe consequences for mammalian health. Recently, we have identified several related amine compounds such as agmatine and putrescine that promote the production of high levels of trichothecene toxins, such as deoxynivalenol (DON), in culture by F. graminearum and F. sporotrichioides. Here, a global analysis of fungal gene expression using the Affymetrix Fusarium GeneChip during culture under DON-inducing conditions compared with noninducing conditions is reported. Agmatine differentially regulated a large number of fungal genes, including both known and previously uncharacterized putative secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters. In silico prediction of binding sites for the transcriptional regulator (TRI6) controlling TRI gene expression and gene expression analysis in a TRI6 mutant of F. graminearum showed that three of the differentially regulated genes were under the control of TRI6. Gene knock-out mutations of two of these genes resulted in mutants with massively increased production of DON and increased aggressiveness toward wheat. Our results not only identify a novel mechanism of negative regulation of DON production and virulence in F. graminearum but also point out the potential of this pathogen to evolve with an ability to produce massively increased amounts of toxins and increased virulence."
"22013911","articletitle","The velvet gene, FgVe1, affects fungal development and positively regulates trichothecene biosynthesis and pathogenicity in Fusarium graminearum."
"22013911","abstracttext","Trichothecenes are a group of toxic secondary metabolites produced mainly by Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph: Gibberella zeae) during the infection of crop plants, including wheat, maize, barley, oats, rye and rice. Some fungal genes involved in trichothecene biosynthesis have been shown to encode regulatory proteins. However, the global regulation of toxin biosynthesis is still enigmatic. In addition to the production of secondary metabolites belonging to the trichothecene family, F. graminearum produces the red pigment aurofusarin. The gene regulation underlying the production of aurofusarin is not well understood. The velvet gene (veA) is conserved in various genera of filamentous fungi. Recently, the veA gene from Aspergillus nidulans has been shown to be the key component of the velvet complex regulating development and secondary metabolism. Using blast analyses, we identified the velvet gene from F. graminearum, FgVe1. Disruption of FgVe1 causes several phenotypic effects. However, the complementation of this mutant with the FgVe1 gene restores the wild-type phenotypes. The in vitro phenotypes include hyperbranching of the mycelium, suppression of aerial hyphae formation, reduced hydrophobicity of the mycelium and highly reduced sporulation. Our data also show that FgVe1 modulates the production of the aurofusarin pigment and is essential for the expression of Tri genes and the production of trichothecenes. Pathogenicity studies performed on flowering wheat plants indicate that FgVe1 is a positive regulator of virulence in F. graminearum."

"22467498","abstracttext","The genome of the white rot basidiomycete Pleurotus ostreatus includes 12 phenol oxidase (laccase) genes. In this study, we examined their expression profiles in different fungal strains under different culture conditions (submerged and solid cultures) and in the presence of a wheat straw extract, which was used as an inducer of the laccase gene family. We used a reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)-based approach and focused on determining the reaction parameters (in particular, the reference gene set for the normalization and reaction efficiency determinations) used to achieve an accurate estimation of the relative gene expression values. The results suggested that (i) laccase gene transcription is upregulated in the induced submerged fermentation (iSmF) cultures but downregulated in the solid fermentation (SSF) cultures, (ii) the Lacc2 and Lacc10 genes are the main sources of laccase activity in the iSmF cultures upon induction with water-soluble wheat straw extracts, and (iii) an additional, as-yet-uncharacterized activity (Unk1) is specifically induced in SSF cultures that complements the activity of Lacc2 and Lacc10. Moreover, both the enzymatic laccase activities and the Lacc gene family transcription profiles greatly differ between closely related strains. These differences can be targeted for biotechnological breeding programs for enzyme production in submerged fermentation reactors."

In order to accelerate gene cloning from any cropping line, we report 'targeted chromosome-based cloning via long-range assembly' (TACCA). TACCA combines lossless genome-complexity reduction via chromosome flow sorting with Chicago long-range linkage to assemble complex genomes. We applied TACCA to produce a high-quality (N50 of 9.76 Mb) de novo chromosome assembly of the wheat line CH Campala Lr22a in only 4 months. Using this assembly we cloned the broad-spectrum Lr22a leaf-rust resistance gene, using molecular marker information and ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutants, and found that Lr22a encodes an intracellular immune receptor homologous to the Arabidopsis thaliana RPM1 protein."

We performed map-based cloning and genome-wide association studies to isolate a candidate for the mildew avirulence gene AvrPm2. We then used transient expression assays in Nicotiana benthamiana to demonstrate specific and strong recognition of AvrPm2 by Pm2. The virulent AvrPm2 allele arose from a conserved 12Â kb deletion, while there is no protein sequence diversity in the gene pool of avirulent B.Â g.Â tritici isolates. We found one polymorphic AvrPm2 allele in B.Â g.Â triticale and one orthologue in B.Â g.Â secalis and both are recognized by Pm2. AvrPm2 belongs to a small gene family encoding structurally conserved RNase-like effectors, including Avr a13 from B.Â g.Â hordei, the cognate Avr of the barley resistance gene Mla13. These results demonstrate the conservation of functional avirulence genes in two cereal powdery mildews specialized on different hosts, thus providing a possible explanation for successful introgression of resistance genes from rye or other grass relatives to wheat."
"28135317","articletitle","Mis-Spliced Lr34 Transcript Events in Winter Wheat."
"28135317","abstracttext","Lr34 in wheat is a non-race-specific gene that confers resistance against multiple fungal pathogens. The resistant allele Lr34 and the susceptible allele Lr34s can be distinguished by three polymorphisms that cause alternation of deduced amino acid sequences of Lr34 at the protein level. In seedlings of a cultivar carrying the resistant Lr34r allele, only a portion (35%) of its transcripts was correctly spliced and the majority (65%) of its transcripts were incorrectly spliced due to multiple mis-splicing events. Lr34 mis-splicing events were also observed at adult plant age when this gene exerts its function. All of the mis-spliced Lr34r cDNA transcripts observed in this study resulted in a premature stop codon due to a shift of the open reading frame; hence, the mis-spliced Lr34r cDNAs were deduced to encode incomplete proteins. Even if a cultivar has a functional Lr34 gene, its transcripts might not completely splice in a correct pattern. These findings suggested that the partial resistance conferred by a quantitative gene might be due to mis-splicing events in its transcripts; hence, the resistance of the gene could be increased by eliminating or mutating regulators that cause mis-splicing events in wheat."

Although AvrStb6 was located in a recombination hotspot, it was found in every strain, with 71 polymorphic sites that produced 41 distinct DNA haplotypes encoding 30 AvrStb6 protein isoforms. An AvrStb6 homologue was found in the closest known relative, Z.Â pseudotritici, but not in three other closely related Zymoseptoria species, indicating that this gene has emerged in Zymoseptoria quite recently. Two AvrStb6 homologues with nucleotide similarities greater than 70% were identified on chromosome 10 in all Z.Â tritici isolates, suggesting that AvrStb6 belongs to a multigene family of candidate effectors that has expanded recently through gene duplication. The AvrStb6 sequences exhibited strong evidence for non-neutral evolution, including a large number of non-synonymous mutations, with significant positive diversifying selection operating on nine of the 82 codons. It appears that balancing selection is operating across the entire gene in natural field populations. There was also evidence for co-evolving codons within the gene that may reflect compensatory mutations associated with the evasion of recognition by Stb6. Intragenic recombination also appears to have affected the diversity of AvrStb6."

"28856645","abstracttext","Cereal rust fungi are destructive pathogens, threatening grain production worldwide. Targeted breeding for resistance utilizing host resistance genes has been effective. However, breakdown of resistance occurs frequently and continued efforts are needed to understand how these fungi overcome resistance and to expand the range of available resistance genes. Whole genome sequencing, transcriptomic and proteomic studies followed by genome-wide computational and comparative analyses have identified large repertoire of genes in rust fungi among which are candidates predicted to code for pathogenicity and virulence factors. Some of these genes represent defence triggering avirulence effectors. However, functions of most genes still needs to be assessed to understand the biology of these obligate biotrophic pathogens. Since genetic manipulations such as gene deletion and genetic transformation are not yet feasible in rust fungi, performing functional gene studies is challenging. Recently, Host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) has emerged as a useful tool to characterize gene function in rust fungi while infecting and growing in host plants. We utilized Barley stripe mosaic virus-mediated virus induced gene silencing (BSMV-VIGS) to induce HIGS of candidate rust fungal genes in the wheat host to determine their role in plant-fungal interactions. Here, we describe the methods for using BSMV-VIGS in wheat for functional genomics study in cereal rust fungi."

"29693722","abstracttext","Cultivar-strain specificity in the wheat-Zymoseptoria tritici pathosystem determines the infection outcome and is controlled by resistance genes on the host side, many of which have been identified. On the pathogen side, however, the molecular determinants of specificity remain largely unknown. We used genetic mapping, targeted gene disruption and allele swapping to characterise the recognition of the new avirulence factor Avr3D1. We then combined population genetic and comparative genomic analyses to characterise the evolutionary trajectory of Avr3D1. Avr3D1 is specifically recognised by wheat cultivars harbouring the Stb7 resistance gene, triggering a strong defence response without preventing pathogen infection and reproduction. Avr3D1 resides in a cluster of putative effector genes located in a genome region populated by independent transposable element insertions. The gene was present in all 132 investigated strains and is highly polymorphic, with 30 different protein variants identified. We demonstrated that specific amino acid substitutions in Avr3D1 led to evasion of recognition. These results demonstrate that quantitative resistance and gene-for-gene interactions are not mutually exclusive. Localising avirulence genes in highly plastic genomic regions probably facilitates accelerated evolution that enables escape from recognition by resistance proteins."

We compared the transcriptomes of the P. nodorum wildtype and a strain deleted in PnPf2 (pf2-69) during in vitro growth and host infection to further elucidate targets of PnPf2 signalling. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed (DE) genes revealed that genes associated with plant cell wall degradation and proteolysis were enriched in down-regulated DE gene sets in pf2-69 compared to SN15. In contrast, genes associated with redox control, nutrient and ion transport were up-regulated in the mutant. Further analysis of the DE gene set revealed that PnPf2 positively regulates twelve genes that encode effector-like proteins. Two of these genes encode proteins with homology to previously characterised effectors in other fungal phytopathogens. In addition to modulating effector gene expression, PnPf2 may play a broader role in the establishment of a necrotrophic lifestyle by orchestrating the expression of genes associated with plant cell wall degradation and nutrient assimilation."

"33176001","abstracttext","Pm1a, the first powdery mildew resistance gene described in wheat, is part of a complex resistance (R) gene cluster located in a distal region of chromosome 7AL that has suppressed genetic recombination. A nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune receptor gene was isolated using mutagenesis and R gene enrichment sequencing (MutRenSeq). Stable transformation confirmed Pm1a identity which induced a strong resistance phenotype in transgenic plants upon challenge with avirulent Blumeria graminis (wheat powdery mildew) pathogens. A high-density genetic map of a B. graminis family segregating for Pm1a avirulence combined with pathogen genome resequencing and RNAseq identified AvrPm1a effector gene candidates. In planta expression identified an effector, with an N terminal Y/FxC motif, that induced a strong hypersensitive response when co-expressed with Pm1a in Nicotiana benthamiana. Single chromosome enrichment sequencing (ChromSeq) and assembly of chromosome 7A suggested that suppressed recombination around the Pm1a region was due to a rearrangement involving chromosomes 7A, 7B and 7D. The cloning of Pm1a and its identification in a highly rearranged region of chromosome 7A provides insight into the role of chromosomal rearrangements in the evolution of this complex resistance cluster."

"18942957","articletitle","A Gene-for-Gene Relationship Between Wheat and Mycosphaerella graminicola, the Septoria Tritici Blotch Pathogen."
"18942957","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Specific resistances to isolates of the ascomycete fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola, which causes Septoria tritici blotch of wheat, have been detected in many cultivars. Cvs. Flame and Hereward, which have specific resistance to the isolate IPO323, were crossed with the susceptible cv. Longbow. The results of tests on F1 and F2 progeny indicated that a single semidominant gene controls resistance to IPO323 in each of the resistant cultivars. This was confirmed in F3 families of Flame x Longbow, which were either homozygous resistant, homozygous susceptible, or segregating in tests with IPO323 but were uniformly susceptible to another isolate, IPO94269. None of 100 F2 progeny of Flame x Hereward were susceptible to IPO323, indicating that the resistance genes in these two cultivars are the same, closely linked, or allelic. The resistance gene in cv. Flame was mapped to the short arm of chromosome 3A using microsatellite markers and was named Stb6. Fifty-nine progeny of a cross between IPO323 and IPO94269 were used in complementary genetic analysis of the pathogen to test a gene-for-gene relationship between Stb6 and the avirulence gene in IPO323. Avirulence to cvs. Flame, Hereward, Shafir, Bezostaya 1, and Vivant and the breeding line NSL92-5719 cosegregated, and the ratio of virulent to avirulent was close to 1:1, suggesting that these wheat lines may all recognize the same avirulence gene and may all have Stb6. Together, these data provide the first demonstration that isolate-specific resistance of wheat to Septoria tritici blotch follows a gene-for-gene relationship."
"22660629","articletitle","Genetic analysis and molecular mapping of a new powdery mildew resistant gene Pm46 in common wheat."
"22660629","abstracttext","Powdery mildew (PM), caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), has become a serious disease and caused severe yield losses in the wheat production worldwide. Resistance gene(s) in wheat cultivars can be quickly overcome by newly evolved pathogen races when these genes are employed for long time or in a large area. It is urgent to search for new sources of resistance to be used in wheat breeding. Tabasco is a German resistant cultivar and a new source of resistance gene(s) to PM. An F(2) population was developed from a cross between Tabasco and a Chinese susceptible cultivar Ningnuo 1. Infection types in 472 F(2) plants and 436 F(2-3) families were evaluated by inoculating plants with isolate Bgt19. Results showed that a single dominant gene, designed Pm46, controlled powdery mildew resistance in Tabasco. This gene was located to the short arm of chromosome 5D (5DS) and flanked by simple sequence repeat markers Xgwm205 and Xcfd81 at 18.9 cM apart. Because another resistance gene Pm2 was also located on 5DS, 15 Bgt isolates were used to inoculate Tabasco and Ulka/8*Cc (Pm2 carrier). The results showed that Tabasco was highly resistant to all of the 15 isolates tested, while Ulka/8*Cc was susceptible to 4 of the isolates, suggesting that Tabasco may carry resistant gene(s) different from Pm2 gene in Ulka/8*Cc. To test the allelism between Pm46 and Pm2, an F(2) population between Tabasco and Ulka/8*Cc was developed. Isolate Bgt2, avirulent to both parents, was used to evaluate the F(2) population and two susceptible plants were identified from 536 progenies with F(2) plants. This result indicated that Pm46 is not allelic to Pm2. Therefore, Pm46 is a new gene for PM resistance identified in this study."

"18470064","abstracttext","The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) affects developmental and physiological processes that can impact crop production. These processes include germination, environmental stress responses in vegetative tissue, embryo maturation, and dormancy. Identification and molecular tagging of ABA-responsive genes, as well as the vp1 gene, required for ABA sensitivity, may be valuable in developing breeding strategies designed for manipulating ABA-regulated traits. Using aneuploid genetic stocks and alien substitution lines the chromosomal location of vp1 and seven abscisic acid (ABA) responsive genes was determined in wheat and Lophopyrum elongatum (Host) LÃ¶ve. Clones (gene homology, if known, in parentheses) isolated from wheat hybridized to wheat and L. elongatum homoeologous chromosome groups as follows: pMA80 (dhn), chromosome 4; pMA1949 (group 3 LEA (1I)), chromosome 3S; pMA1951, chromosome 5S; pMA1959 (Em), chromosome 1L; pMA2005 (group 3 LEA), chromosome 1S; and PKABA1, chromosome 2L. Clone pBS128, corresponding to an ABA-responsive gene from Bromus secalinus, hybridized to wheat chromosome 2S. The cDNA clone pcvp23 that is homologous to vp1, a gene required for ABA responsiveness and the prevention of precocious germination in maize embryos, did not hybridize well with wheat but hybridized to chromosomes 3L and 7&beta; in L. elongatum. Three of the clones mapped previously in barley by other researchers, pMA1949, pMA1951, pMA1959, were found here to be on the corresponding homoeologous chromosomes in wheat."

"23234406","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a devastating disease worldwide, affecting wheat and other small grains. To identify key wheat genes involved in FHB pathogenesis, 406 FHB-related wheat expressed sequence tags functionally identified in Sumai 3 were investigated for their association with FHB-resistance quantitative trait loci (QTL) Fhb1 and Fhb_6BL in 2010 and 2011. A total of 47 candidate genes were identified by bulk analysis, near-isogenic screening and expression QTL mapping, and were finally mapped to their carrier chromosomes with Chinese Spring nulli-tetra deficiency lines. One gene, designated WFhb1_c1 (wheat Fhb1 candidate gene 1), was both functionally associated with and physically located within Fhb1 and was found to be weakly similar (E = 5e+0) to an Arabidopsis gene encoding pectin methyl esterase inhibitor. Two other genes, designated WFI_6BL1 and WFI_6BL2 (wheat-Fusarium interaction genes 6BL1 and 6BL2), were functionally associated with Fhb_6BL but physically mapped on chromosomes 7D and 5A, respectively. WFI_6BL1 was annotated as a 13- lipoxygenase gene and WFI_6BL2 might encode a PR-4-like protein. Our data suggested that i) Fhb1 seems to contribute to FHB resistance by reducing susceptibility in the first 60 h, ii) Fhb_6BL makes its contribution via the jasmonate-mediated pathways, and iii) wheat seems to activate its defense mechanism in the biotrophic phase of FHB pathogenesis."

"25585663","abstracttext","MYB transcription factors exist in a large copy number and control various plant phenotypes. We cloned R2R3 MYB-type transcription factors that determine the coloration of basal sheaths in barley and wheat coleoptiles. These genes are highly homologous to maize C1 and rice OsC1, regulators for anthocyanin biosynthesis, but they control seed pigmentation in maize and rice. On the basis of high homology, barley and wheat counterparts are designated HvC1 and TaC1, respectively. HvC1 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 7H, and TaC1 genes are located on the short arms of chromosomes 7A, 7B, and 7D (TaC1-A1, B1, and D1, respectively). HvC1 is a strong candidate for Ant1 because of (1) complete co-segregation of anthocyanin pigmentation phenotype of the basal sheath with the HvC1 genotype in genetic mapping, and (2) complete deletion of the HvCl gene in two anthocyanin-decreased allelic mutants (ant1.1 and ant1.2) that were induced by irradiation. In contrast, colorless coleoptile wheat lines had lesions in all three genomes consisting of a single-nucleotide substitution or a 1-bp deletion of TaC1-A1, a 1.7-kb insertion of TaC1-B1, and a 2.0-kb insertion of TaC1-D1. At least one normal TaC1 gene appears to be sufficient to produce anthocyanin pigments in wheat coleoptiles. Previous crossing experiments localized Rc (red coleoptile) genes to homoeologous group 7 chromosomes and deduced Rc genotypes of several wheat lines. Their TaC1 gene sequence variation coincided with deduced Rc genotypes; therefore, the present molecular genetic study demonstrates that TaC1 is a strong candidate for Rc in wheat."

"30727301","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most important diseases of wheat worldwide. The best strategy to control stripe rust is to grow resistant cultivars, but only a few effective genes are available. The wheat accession H9020-1-6-8-3 is a translocation line previously developed from interspecific hybridization between wheat genotype 7182 and Psathyrostachys huashanica, and is resistant to most Chinese Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici races. To identify the resistance genes in the translocation line, H9020-1-6-8-3 was crossed with susceptible genotype Mingxian 169, and seedlings of parents and F 1 , F 2 , and F 3 progenies were tested with prevalent Chinese P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races CYR32 and CYR33 under controlled greenhouse conditions. The genetic results indicated that two single dominant genes in H9020-1-6-8-3 confer resistance to CYR32 and CYR33, respectively. The gene for resistance to CYR33 was temporarily designated as YrH9020. Six simple-sequence repeat markers were used to map the resistance gene to the short arm of wheat chromosome 2D, using 329 F 2 plants tested with CYR33 in the greenhouse. The genetic distances of the two closest flanking markers, Xgwm261 and Xgwm455, were 4.4 and 5.8 centimorgans, respectively. Disease assessments and polymorphic tests of the flanking markers among the Psathyrostachys huashanica line and wheat lines 7182, H9020-1-6-8-3, and Mingxian169 suggested that the resistance gene YrH9020 in H9020-1-6-8-3 was originally from P. huashanica. The exotic stripe rust resistance gene and linked molecular markers should be useful for pyramiding with other genes to develop wheat cultivars with high-level and durable resistance to stripe rust."

"32831009","abstracttext_background","Drought is one of the most adverse environmental factors limiting crop productions and it is important to identify key genetic determinants for food safety. Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) are known to be involved in plant growth, development, and environmental stresses. However, biological functions and regulatory mechanisms of many plant CPKs have not been explored. In our previous study, abundance of the wheat CPK34 (TaCPK34) protein was remarkably upregulated in wheat plants suffering from drought stress, inferring that it could be involved in this stress. Therefore, here we further detected its function and mechanism in response to drought stress."
"32831009","abstracttext_results","Transcripts of the TaCPK34 gene were significantly induced after PEG-stimulated water deficiency (20% PEG6000) or 100âÎ¼M abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. The TaCPK34 gene was transiently silenced in wheat genome by using barley stripe mosaic virus-induced silencing (BSMV-VIGS) method. After 14âdays of drought stress, the transiently TaCPK34-silenced wheat seedlings showed more sensitivity compared with control, and the plant biomasses and relative water contents significantly decreased, whereas soluble sugar and MDA contents increased. The iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics was employed to measure the protein expression profiles in leaves of the transiently TaCPK34-silenced wheat plants after drought stress. There were 6103 proteins identified, of these, 51 proteins exhibited significantly altered abundance, they were involved in diverse function. And sequence analysis on the promoters of genes, which encoded the above identified proteins, indicated that some promoters harbored some ABA-responsive elements. We determined the interactions between TaCPK34 and three identified proteins by using bimolecular fluorescent complementation (BiFC) method and our data indicated that TaCPK34directly interacted with the glutathione S-transferase 1 and prx113, respectively."

"14693379","articletitle","Transfer of RPS14 and RPL5 from the mitochondrion to the nucleus in grasses."
"14693379","abstracttext","Gene transfer from the mitochondrion to the nucleus, a process of outstanding importance to the evolution of the eukaryotic cell, is an on-going phenomenon in higher plants. After transfer, the mitochondrial gene has to be adapted to the nuclear context by acquiring a new promoter and targeting information to direct the protein back to the organelle. To better understand the strategies developed by higher plants to transfer organellar genes during evolution, we investigated the fate of the mitochondrial RPL5-RPS14 locus in grasses. While maize mitochondrial genome does not contain RPS14 and RPL5 genes, wheat mitochondrial DNA contains an intact RPL5 gene and a nonfunctional RPS14 pseudogene. RPL5 and PsiRPS14 are co-transcribed and their transcripts are edited. In wheat, the functional RPS14 gene is located in the nucleus, within the intron of the respiratory complex II iron-sulfur subunit gene (SDH2). Its organization and expression mechanisms are similar to those previously described in maize and rice, allowing us to conclude that RPS14 transfer and nuclear activation occurred before divergence of these grasses. Unexpectedly, we found evidence for a more recent RPL5 transfer to the nucleus in wheat. This nuclear wheat RPL5 acquired its targeting information by duplication of an existing targeting presequence for another mitochondrial protein, ribosomal protein L4. Thus, mitochondrial and nuclear functional RPL5 genes appear to be maintained in wheat, supporting the hypothesis that in an intermediate stage of the transfer process, both nuclear and mitochondrial functional genes coexist. Finally, we show that RPL5 has been independently transferred to the nucleus in the maize lineage and has acquired regulatory elements for its expression and a mitochondrial targeting peptide from an unknown source."

"17213908","abstracttext","The wheat tan spot fungus (Pyrenophora tritici-repentis) produces a well-characterized host-selective toxin (HST) known as Ptr ToxA, which induces necrosis in genotypes that harbor the Tsn1 gene on chromosome 5B. In previous work, we showed that the Stagonospora nodorum isolate Sn2000 produces at least 2 HSTs (SnTox1 and SnToxA). Sensitivity to SnTox1 is governed by the Snn1 gene on chromosome 1B in wheat. SnToxA is encoded by a gene with a high degree of similarity to the Ptr ToxA gene. Here, we evaluate toxin sensitivity and resistance to S. nodorum blotch (SNB) caused by Sn2000 in a recombinant inbred population that does not segregate for Snn1. Sensitivity to the Sn2000 toxin preparation cosegregated with sensitivity to Ptr ToxA at the Tsn1 locus. Tsn1-disrupted mutants were insensitive to both Ptr ToxA and SnToxA, suggesting that the 2 toxins are functionally similar, because they recognize the same locus in the host to induce necrosis. The locus harboring the tsn1 allele underlies a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for resistance to SNB caused by Sn2000, and explains 62% of the phenotypic variation, indicating that the toxin is an important virulence factor for this fungus. The Tsn1 locus and several minor QTLs together explained 77% of the phenotypic variation. Therefore, the Tsn1-ToxA interaction in the wheat-S. nodorum pathosystem parallels that of the wheat-tan spot system, and the wheat Tsn1 gene serves as a major determinant for susceptibility to both SNB and tan spot."

"26791837","abstracttext_key message","The powdery mildew resistance gene Pm21 was physically and comparatively mapped by newly developed markers. Seven candidate genes were verified to be required for Pm21 -mediated resistance to wheat powdery mildew. Pm21, a gene derived from wheat wild relative Dasypyrum villosum, has been transferred into common wheat and widely utilized in wheat resistance breeding for powdery mildew. Previously, Pm21 has been located to the bin FL0.45-0.58 of 6VS by using deletion stocks. However, its fine mapping is still a hard work. In the present study, 30 gene-derived 6VS-specific markers were obtained based on the collinearity among genomes of Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza and Triticeae, and then physically and comparatively mapped in the bin FL0.45-0.58 and its nearby chromosome region. According to the maps, the bin FL0.45-0.58 carrying Pm21 was closely flanked by the markers 6VS-03 and 6VS-23, which further narrowed the orthologous regions to 1.06Â Mb in Brachypodium and 1.38Â Mb in rice, respectively. Among the conserved genes shared by Brachypodium and rice, four serine/threonine protein kinase genes (DvMPK1, DvMLPK, DvUPK and DvPSYR1), one protein phosphatase gene (DvPP2C) and two transcription factor genes (DvGATA and DvWHY) were confirmed to be required for Pm21-mediated resistance to wheat powdery mildew by barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing (BSMV-VIGS) and transcriptional pattern analyses. In summary, this study gives new insights into the genetic basis of the Pm21 locus and the disease resistance pathways mediated by Pm21."

"28400854","abstracttext_background","The barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) has become a popular vector to study gene function in cereals. However, studies have been limited to gene silencing in leaves of barley or wheat. In addition, the method produces high variability between different leaves and plants. To overcome these limitations, we explored the potential of modifying the inoculation protocol for BSMV gene overexpression. An improved light, oxygen or voltage-sensing (iLOV) domain-based fluorescent protein was used as a reporter of gene expression to monitor the infection and spread of BSMV. Tobacco ( Nicotiana benthamiana ) leaves were infected via agroinfiltration and the leaves were homogenized to extract the BSMV particles and inoculate wheat tissues using the traditional leaf abrasion method or by incubation during seed imbibition in a Petri dish."

"28400854","abstracttext_conclusion","Our results show that BSMV can be used as a vector for the expression of small genes such as iLOV in wheat roots and leaves. The inoculation by seed imbibition allows genes to be expressed rapidly and uniformly in wheat and different monocot and dicot species compared to the traditional leaf abrasion method. It also produces high successful transformation as early as 7Â days post infection allowing gene function studies during the first generation of infected plants. Furthermore, the method is simple, rapid, and inexpensive compared to the production of transgenic plants."

"27663684","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance in wheat is considered to be polygenic in nature. Cell wall fortification is one of the best resistance mechanisms in wheat against Fusarium graminearum which causes FHB. Metabolomics approach in our study led to the identification of a wide array of resistance-related (RR) metabolites, among which hydroxycinnamic acid amides (HCAAs), such as coumaroylagmatine and coumaroylputrescine, were the highest fold change RR metabolites in the rachis of a resistant near-isogenic line (NIL-R) upon F.Â graminearum infection. Placement of these metabolites in the secondary metabolic pathway led to the identification of a gene encoding agmatine coumaroyl transferase, herein referred to as TaACT, as a candidate gene. Based on wheat survey sequence, TaACT was located within a FHB quantitative trait loci on chromosome 2DL (FHB QTL-2DL) between the flanking markers WMC245 and GWM608. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that TaACT shared closest phylogenetic relationship with an ACT ortholog in barley. Sequence analysis of TaACT in resistant and susceptible NILs, with contrasting levels of resistance to FHB, led to the identification of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and two inversions that may be important for gene function. Further, a role for TaACT in FHB resistance was functionally validated by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in wheat NIL-R and based on complementation studies in Arabidopsis with act mutant background. The disease severity, fungal biomass and RR metabolite analysis confirmed TaACT as an important gene in wheat FHB QTL-2DL, conferring resistance to F.Â graminearum."

"29696297","abstracttext_key message","A new gene for adult plant leaf rust resistance in wheat was mapped to chromosome 3BL. This gene was designated as Lr77. 'Santa Fe' is a hard red winter cultivar that has had long-lasting resistance to the leaf rust fungus, Puccinia triticina. The objective of this study was to determine the chromosome location of the adult plant leaf rust resistance in Santa Fe wheat. A partial backcross line of 'Thatcher' (Tc) wheat with adult plant leaf rust resistance derived from Santa Fe was crossed with Thatcher to develop a Thatcher//Tc*2/Santa Fe F 6 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population. The RIL population and parental lines were evaluated for segregation of leaf rust resistance in three field plot tests and in an adult plant greenhouse test. A genetic map of the RIL population was constructed using 90,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers with the Illumina Infinium iSelect 90K wheat bead array. A significant quantitative trait locus for reduction of leaf rust severity in all four tests was found on chromosome 3BL that segregated as a single adult plant resistance gene. The RILs with the allele from the resistant parent for SNP marker IWB10344 had lower leaf rust severity and a moderately resistant to moderately susceptible response compared to the susceptible RILs and Thatcher. The gene derived from Santa Fe on chromosome 3BL was designated as Lr77. Kompetitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction assay markers linked to Lr77 on 3BL should be useful for selection of wheat germplasm with this gene."

"31986184","abstracttext","The breeding of agriculturally useful genes from wild crop relatives must take into account recent and future climate change. In Japan, the development of early heading wheat cultivars without the use of any major gene controlling the heading date is desired to avoid overlap of the harvesting time before the rainy season. Here, we backcrossed two early heading lines of a synthetic hexaploid wheat, derived from a crossing between durum wheat and the wild wheat progenitor Aegilops tauschii, with four Japanese elite cultivars to develop early heading lines of bread wheat. In total, nine early heading lines that showed a heading date two to eight days earlier than their parental cultivars in field conditions were selected and established from the selfed progenies of the two- or three-times backcrossed populations. The whole appearance and spike shape of the selected early heading lines looked like their parental wheat cultivars. The mature grains of the selected lines had the parental cultivars' characteristics, although the grains exhibited longer and narrower shapes. RNA sequencing-based genotyping was performed to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms between the selected lines and their parental wheat cultivars, which revealed the chromosomal regions transmitted from the parental synthetic wheat to the selected lines. The introgression regions could shorten wheat heading date, and their chromosomal positions were dependent on the backcrossed wheat cultivars. Therefore, early heading synthetic hexaploid wheat is useful for fine-tuning of the heading date through introgression of Ae. tauschii chromosomal regions."

In this study, B. sorokiniana from wheat leaf (W- B. sorokiniana ) showed much stronger pathogenicity toward wheat than endophytic B. sorokiniana from Pogostemon cablin (P- B. sorokiniana ). The transcriptomes and metabolomics of the two B. sorokiniana strains and transcriptomes of B. sorokiniana -infected wheat leaves were comparatively analyzed. In addition, the expression levels of unigenes related to pathogenicity, toxicity, and cell wall degradation were predicted and validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. Results indicated that pathogenicity-related genes, especially the gene encoding loss-of-pathogenicity B (LopB) protein, cell wall-degrading enzymes (particularly glycosyl hydrolase-related genes), and killer and Ptr necrosis toxin-producing related unigenes in the W- B. sorokiniana played important roles in the pathogenicity of W- B. sorokiniana toward wheat. The down-regulation of cell wall protein, photosystem peptide, and rubisco protein suggested impairment of the phytosynthetic system and cell wall of B. sorokiniana -infected wheat. The up-regulation of hydrolase inhibitor, NAC (including NAM, ATAF1 and CUC2) transcriptional factor, and peroxidase in infected wheat tissues suggests their important roles in the defensive response of wheat to W- B. sorokiniana . This is the first report providing a comparison of the transcriptome and metabolome between the pathogenic and endophytic B. sorokiniana strains, thus providing a molecular clue for the pathogenic mechanism of W- B. sorokiniana toward wheat and wheat's defensive response mechanism to W- B. sorokiniana. Our study could offer molecular clues for controlling the hazard of leaf spot and root rot diseases in wheat, thus improving wheat yield in the future."

"23874966","abstracttext","The narrow genetic background restricts wheat yield and quality improvement. The wild relatives of wheat are the huge gene pools for wheat improvement and can broaden its genetic basis. Production of wheat-alien translocation lines can transfer alien genes to wheat. So it is important to develop an efficient method to induce wheat-alien chromosome translocation. Agropyroncristatum (P genome) carries many potential genes beneficial to disease resistance, stress tolerance and high yield. Chromosome 6P possesses the desirable genes exhibiting good agronomic traits, such as high grain number per spike, powdery mildew resistance and stress tolerance. In this study, the wheat-A. cristatum disomic addition was used as bridge material to produce wheat-A. cristatum translocation lines induced by (60)Co-Î³irradiation. The results of genomic in situ hybridization showed that 216 plants contained alien chromosome translocation among 571 self-pollinated progenies. The frequency of translocation was 37.83%, much higher than previous reports. Moreover, various alien translocation types were identified. The analysis of M2 showed that 62.5% of intergeneric translocation lines grew normally without losing the translocated chromosomes. The paper reported a high efficient technical method for inducing alien translocation between wheat and Agropyroncristatum. Additionally, these translocation lines will be valuable for not only basic research on genetic balance, interaction and expression of different chromosome segments of wheat and alien species, but also wheat breeding programs to utilize superior agronomic traits and good compensation effect from alien chromosomes."

"28868214","abstracttext","Glutenin is a major protein fraction contributing to the functional properties of gluten and dough. The glutenin constitutes 30-40% of the protein in wheat flour and about half of that in gluten. It is essential to identify correct glutenin alleles and to improve wheat quality by selecting alleles that exert favorable effects. Moroccan wheat cultivars are unique in West Asia and North Africa region, since many of them possess resistance to Hessian fly, a pest, which is becoming important in other countries in the region. Hence, these cultivars are being used as donor for the resistance in the breeding program. Here, we determine the allelic variation in high-molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) and low-molecular weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) in Moroccan cultivars of bread and durum wheat using the gene-specific PCR markers. In 20 cultivars of bread wheat, 9 different allele variants were detected at HMW-GS and 13 different allele variants were detected at LMW-GS, in which the alleles Glu - A1b (2*), Glu - B1i (17Â +Â 18), Glu - B1c (7*/7Â +Â 9), Glu - D1d (5Â +Â 10) , Glu - A3c, Glu - B3 Â  h, and Glu - D3b were the most frequents. In 26 cultivars of durum wheat, less allelic variation was found: seven different allele variants at HMW-GS and six different allele variants at LMW-GS were identified, in which the major alleles were Glu - A1c (null), Glu - B1b (7Â +Â 8), Glu - B1e (20), Glu - A3c, and Glu - B3d . The mean value of the genetic diversity for the glutenin loci was 0.502 in bread wheat and 0.449 in durum wheat. Most of the glutenin alleles carried by Moroccan bread wheat cultivars impart good bread-making quality. Most of the durum wheat glutenin alleles were related to low strength dough or poor quality and need to be improved. To improve quality of Moroccan durum wheat, essentially, Glu - A1c and Glu - B3d alleles of the genes should be replaced with the better alleles through breeding."

"32593926","abstracttext","Cadmium (Cd) contamination is a big challenge for managing food supply and safety around the world. Reduction of the bioaccumulation of cadmium (Cd) in wheat is an important way to minimize Cd hazards to human health. This study compared and highlighted the effects of soil and foliar applications of Zn on Cd accumulation and toxicity in cultivars with high Cd accumulation (high-Cd wheat) and low Cd accumulation (low-Cd wheat). Both foliar and soil Zn applications provided effective strategies for reducing wheat grain Cd concentrations in the high-Cd wheat by 26-49% and 25-52%, respectively, and these also significantly reduced the concentrations in wheat stems and leaves. Foliar and soil Zn applications significantly reduced Cd in leaves and stems of the low-Cd wheat but had no effects on grain Cd. Both soil and foliar Zn applications significantly alleviated Cd toxicity by regulation of Cd transport genes, as reflected by the increased grain yield and antioxidant enzyme activity in the wheat tissues. Gene expression in response to zinc application differed in the two wheat cultivars. Down-regulation of the influx transporter (TaNramp5) and upregulation of the efflux transporters (TaTM20 and TaHMA3) in the high-Cd wheat may have contributed to the Zn-dependent Cd alleviation and enhanced its tolerance to Cd toxicity. Additionally, foliar Zn applications down-regulated the leaf TaHMA2 expression that reduced root Cd translocation to shoots, while soil Zn applications down-regulated the root TaLCT1 expression, which contributed to the reduction of root Cd concentrations. Soil (99Â kg ZnSO 4 Â·7H 2 O ha -1 ) and foliar (0.36Â kg ZnSO 4 Â·7H 2 O ha -1 ) Zn applications can effectively decrease the Cd in grains and guarantee food safety and yield, simultaneously. The presented results provide a new insight into the mechanisms of, and strategies for, using Zn for the Cd reduction in wheat."

"32930833","abstracttext_key message","We constructed a homoeologous recombination-based bin map of wheat chromosome 7B, providing a unique physical framework for further study of chromosome 7B and its homoeologues in wheat and its relatives. Homoeologous recombination leads to the dissection and diversification of the wheat genome. Advances in genome sequencing and genotyping have dramatically improved the efficacy and throughput of homoeologous recombination-based genome studies and alien introgression in wheat and its relatives. In this study, we aimed to physically dissect and map wheat chromosome 7B by inducing meiotic recombination of chromosome 7B with its homoeologues 7E in Thinopyrum elongatum and 7S in Aegilops speltoides. The special genotypes, which were double monosomic for chromosomes 7B'â+â7E' or 7B'â+â7S' and homozygous for the ph1b mutant, were produced to enhance 7Bâ-â7E and 7Bâ-â7S recombination. Chromosome-specific DNA markers were developed and used to pre-screen the large recombination populations for 7Bâ-â7E and 7Bâ-â7S recombinants. The DNA marker-mediated preselections were verified by fluorescent genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). In total, 29 7Bâ-â7E and 61 7Bâ-â7S recombinants and multiple chromosome aberrations were recovered and delineated by GISH and the wheat 90Â K SNP assay. Integrated GISH and SNP analysis of the recombinants physically mapped the recombination breakpoints and partitioned wheat chromosome 7B into 44 bins with 523 SNPs assigned within. A composite bin map was constructed for chromosome 7B, showing the bin size and physical distribution of SNPs. This provides a unique physical framework for further study of chromosome 7B and its homoeologues. In addition, the 7Bâ-â7E and 7Bâ-â7S recombinants extend the genetic variability of wheat chromosome 7B and represent useful germplasm for wheat breeding. Thereby, this genomics-enabled chromosome engineering approach facilitates wheat genome study and enriches the gene pool of wheat improvement."
"21702931","articletitle","Multigenic phylogeny and analysis of tree incongruences in Triticeae (Poaceae)."
"21702931","abstracttext_background","Introgressive events (e.g., hybridization, gene flow, horizontal gene transfer) and incomplete lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphisms are a challenge for phylogenetic analyses since different genes may exhibit conflicting genealogical histories. Grasses of the Triticeae tribe provide a particularly striking example of incongruence among gene trees. Previous phylogenies, mostly inferred with one gene, are in conflict for several taxon positions. Therefore, obtaining a resolved picture of relationships among genera and species of this tribe has been a challenging task. Here, we obtain the most comprehensive molecular dataset to date in Triticeae, including one chloroplastic and 26 nuclear genes. We aim to test whether it is possible to infer phylogenetic relationships in the face of (potentially) large-scale introgressive events and/or incomplete lineage sorting; to identify parts of the evolutionary history that have not evolved in a tree-like manner; and to decipher the biological causes of gene-tree conflicts in this tribe."
"21702931","abstracttext_results","We obtain resolved phylogenetic hypotheses using the supermatrix and Bayesian Concordance Factors (BCF) approaches despite numerous incongruences among gene trees. These phylogenies suggest the existence of 4-5 major clades within Triticeae, with Psathyrostachys and Hordeum being the deepest genera. In addition, we construct a multigenic network that highlights parts of the Triticeae history that have not evolved in a tree-like manner. Dasypyrum, Heteranthelium and genera of clade V, grouping Secale, Taeniatherum, Triticum and Aegilops, have evolved in a reticulated manner. Their relationships are thus better represented by the multigenic network than by the supermatrix or BCF trees. Noteworthy, we demonstrate that gene-tree incongruences increase with genetic distance and are greater in telomeric than centromeric genes. Together, our results suggest that recombination is the main factor decoupling gene trees from multigenic trees."
"21702931","abstracttext_conclusions","Our study is the first to propose a comprehensive, multigenic phylogeny of Triticeae. It clarifies several aspects of the relationships among genera and species of this tribe, and pinpoints biological groups with likely reticulate evolution. Importantly, this study extends previous results obtained in Drosophila by demonstrating that recombination can exacerbate gene-tree conflicts in phylogenetic reconstructions."

"1907869","abstracttext","The psaC gene, which encodes the 8.9 kDa iron-sulfur containing subunit of Photosystem I, has been sequenced from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and shows greater similarity to reported plant sequences than other cyanobacterial psaC sequences. The deduced amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by the Synechocystis psaC gene is identical to the tobacco PSA-C sequence. In plants psaC is located in the small single-copy region of the chloroplast genome between two genes (designated ndhE and ndhD) with similarity to genes encoding subunits of the mitochondrial NADH Dehydrogenase Complex I. The 5' ndhE-psaC-ndhD3' gene arrangement of higher plants is only partially conserved in Synechocystis. An open reading frame (ORF) upstream of the Synechocystis psaC gene has 85% identity to the tobacco ndhE gene. Downstream of psaC there is a 273 bp ORF with 48% identity to the 5' portion of the tobacco ndhD gene (1527 bp). psaC, ndhE and the region of similarity to ndhD are present in a single copy in the Synechocystis genome. Part of the wheat ndhD gene was sequenced and used as a probe for the presence of the 3' portion of the ndhD gene. The wheat ndhD probe did not hybridize to Synechocystis or Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 genomic DNA, but did hybridize to Oenothera chloroplast DNA. These results indicate the complete ndhD gene is absent in two cyanobacteria, and raises the question of what role, if any, the ndhD gene product plays in the facultative heterotroph Synechocystis sp.

"17135334","articletitle","Mechanisms and rates of birth and death of dispersed duplicated genes during the evolution of a multigene family in diploid and tetraploid wheats."
"17135334","abstracttext","A family of 5 genes that evolved within the past 1.9 Myr in diploid wheat was characterized. The ancestral gene, ALP-A1, is on chromosome 1A and encodes an aci-reductone dioxygenase-like protein. The duplicated genes ALP-A2, ALP-A3, ALP-A4.1, and ALP-A4.2 acquired complete coding sequences but lost the original promoter. They are on chromosomes 4A, 2A, 6A and 6A, respectively, and evolved sequentially, the youngest duplicated gene always producing the next duplicate. It is shown that dispersed gene duplication rate consists of the primary rate (duplications of ancestral genes) and the secondary rate (duplications of genes that had been generated by recent duplications). The primary rate was 2.5 x 10(-3) gene(-1) Myr(-1) in diploid wheat. The secondary rate was 5.2 x 10(-2) gene(-1) Myr(-1) in the ALP family. The 20-fold acceleration of the secondary rate was caused by the insertion of the ALP-A2 gene into a novel type transposon. Only the ALP-A1 and ALP-A3 genes are transcribed. The transcription of ALP-A3 is directed by a promoter within a DNA fragment similar to a CACTA type of DNA transposons, making ALP-A3 a new gene. The ALP-A3 transcript is longer than that of the ALP-A1. The half-life of ALP duplicated genes was estimated to be 0.87 Myr. Strong purifying selection acting on the ancestral gene ALP-A1 was undiminished by the evolution of duplicated genes. The evolution of the ALP family shows that repeated elements facilitate both gene duplication and expression of duplicated genes and highlights their importance for the evolution of gene repertoire in large plant genomes."

"25232038","abstracttext","Although studied extensively since 1958, the molecular mode of action of the Pairing homeologous 1 (Ph1) gene is still unknown. In polyploid wheat, the diploid-like chromosome pairing is principally controlled by the Ph1 gene via preventing homeologous chromosome pairing (HECP). Here, we report a candidate Ph1 gene (C-Ph1) present in the Ph1 locus, transient as well as stable silencing of which resulted in a phenotype characteristic of the Ph1 gene mutants, including HECP, multivalent formation, and disrupted chromosome alignment on the metaphase I (MI) plate. Despite a highly conserved DNA sequence, the C-Ph1 gene homeologues showed a dramatically different structure and expression pattern, with only the 5B copy showing MI-specific expression, further supporting our claim for the Ph1 gene. In agreement with the previous reports about the Ph1 gene, the predicted protein of the 5A copy of the C-Ph1 gene is truncated, and thus perhaps less effective. The 5D copy is expressed around the onset of meiosis; thus, it may function during the earlier stages of chromosome pairing. Along with alternate splicing, the predicted protein of the 5B copy is different from the protein of the other two copies because of an insertion. These structural and expression differences among the homeologues concurred with the previous observations about Ph1 gene function. Stable RNAi silencing of the wheat gene in Arabidopsis showed multivalents and centromere clustering during meiosis I."

"15729403","abstracttext","Chromosome 5H of Hordeum vulgare 'New Golden' (NG) carries a gene(s) that accelerates heading in a wheat background. To introduce the early heading gene(s) of NG barley into the wheat genome, we attempted to induce homoeologous recombination between wheat and NG 5H chromosomes by 5B nullisomy. A nullisomic 5B, trisomic 5A, monosomic 5H plant (2n = 42) was produced from systematic crosses between aneuploid stocks of wheat group 5 chromosomes. A total of 656 F2 plants produced by self-fertilization were screened for recombinants by a PCR assay with 3 5H-specific amplicon markers. Twelve plants (1.8%) were selected as putative wheat-barley 5H recombinants. Five of them were inviable or sterile and the remaining 7 were fertile and subjected to the progeny test. Cytological analyses using fluorescence in situ hybridization and C-banding revealed that 6 of the 7 progeny lines are true homoeologous recombinants between the long arms of chromosomes 5D and 5H, but that the other one was not a recombinant having an aberrant barley telosome. The 6 cytologically confirmed recombinant lines included only 2 types (3 lines each), which were reciprocal products derived from exchanges at the same distal interval defined by two flanking markers. One type had a small 5HL segment translocated to the 5DL terminal, and the other type had a small terminal 5DL segment translocated to the 5HL terminal. In the latter type, the physical length of translocated barley segments slightly differed among lines. Homoeologous recombinants obtained in this study should be useful for further chromosome manipulation to introgress a small interstitial 5HL chromosome segment with the early heading gene(s) to wheat. Preferential occurrence of restricted types of recombinants is discussed in relation to homoeologous relationships between wheat and barley chromosomes."

"22174904","abstracttext","Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) plays important roles in plant biotic and abiotic stress responses. However, the effect of H(2)O(2) stress on the bread wheat transcriptome is still lacking. To investigate the cellular and metabolic responses triggered by H(2)O(2), we performed an mRNA tag analysis of wheat seedlings under 10 mM H(2)O(2) treatment for 6 hour in one powdery mildew (PM) resistant (PmA) and two susceptible (Cha and Han) lines. In total, 6,156, 6,875 and 3,276 transcripts were found to be differentially expressed in PmA, Han and Cha respectively. Among them, 260 genes exhibited consistent expression patterns in all three wheat lines and may represent a subset of basal H(2)O(2) responsive genes that were associated with cell defense, signal transduction, photosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, redox homeostasis, and transport. Among genes specific to PmA, 'transport' activity was significantly enriched in Gene Ontology analysis. MapMan classification showed that, while both up- and down- regulations were observed for auxin, abscisic acid, and brassinolides signaling genes, the jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling pathway genes were all up-regulated, suggesting H(2)O(2)-enhanced JA/Et functions in PmA. To further study whether any of these genes were involved in wheat PM response, 19 H(2)O(2)-responsive putative defense related genes were assayed in wheat seedlings infected with Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt). Eight of these genes were found to be co-regulated by H(2)O(2) and Bgt, among which a fatty acid desaturase gene TaFAD was then confirmed by virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) to be required for the PM resistance. Together, our data presents the first global picture of the wheat transcriptome under H(2)O(2) stress and uncovers potential links between H(2)O(2) and Bgt responses, hence providing important candidate genes for the PM resistance in wheat."

"24897124","abstracttext","The transgenic wheat line N12-1 containing the WYMV-Nib8 gene was obtained previously through particle bombardment, and it can effectively control the wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV) disease transmitted by Polymyxa graminis at turngreen stage. Due to insertion of an exogenous gene, the transcriptome of wheat may be altered and affect root exudates. Thus, it is important to investigate the potential environmental risk of transgenic wheat before commercial release because of potential undesirable ecological side effects. Our 2-year study at two different experimental locations was performed to analyze the impact of transgenic wheat N12-1 on bacterial and fungal community diversity in rhizosphere soil using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) at four growth stages (seeding stage, turngreen stage, grain-filling stage, and maturing stage). We also explored the activities of urease, sucrase and dehydrogenase in rhizosphere soil. The results showed that there was little difference in bacterial and fungal community diversity in rhizosphere soil between N12-1 and its recipient Y158 by comparing Shannon's, Simpson's diversity index and evenness (except at one or two growth stages). Regarding enzyme activity, only one significant difference was found during the maturing stage at Xinxiang in 2011 for dehydrogenase. Significant growth stage variation was observed during 2 years at two experimental locations for both soil microbial community diversity and enzyme activity. Analysis of bands from the gel for fungal community diversity showed that the majority of fungi were uncultured. The results of this study suggested that virus-resistant transgenic wheat had no adverse impact on microbial community diversity and enzyme activity in rhizosphere soil during 2 continuous years at two different experimental locations. This study provides a theoretical basis for environmental impact monitoring of transgenic wheat when the introduced gene is derived from a virus."

"25142874","abstracttext_key message","This manuscript reports two new genes ( Yr64 and Yr65 ) for effective resistance to stripe rust and usefulness of their flanking SSR markers for marker-assisted selection. Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most important diseases of wheat worldwide and resistance is the best control strategy. Durum wheat accessions PI 331260 and PI 480016 were resistant to all tested Pst races. To transfer the resistance genes to common wheat and map them to wheat chromosomes, both accessions were crossed with the stripe rust-susceptible spring wheat 'Avocet S'. Resistant F3 plants with 42 chromosomes were selected cytologically and by rust phenotype. A single dominant gene for resistance was identified in segregating F4 lines from each cross. F6 populations for each cross were developed from single F5 plants and used for genetic mapping. Different genes from PI 331260 and PI 480016 were mapped to different loci in chromosome 1BS using simple sequence repeat markers. The gene from PI 331260 was flanked by Xgwm413 and Xgdm33 in bin 1BS9-0.84-1.06 at genetic distances of 3.5 and 2.0 cM; and the gene from PI 480016 was flanked by Xgwm18 and Xgwm11 in chromosome bin C-1BS10-0.50 at 1.2 and 2.1 cM, respectively. Chromosomal locations and race and allelism tests indicated that the two genes are different from previously reported stripe rust resistance genes, and therefore are named as Yr64 from PI 331260 and Yr65 from PI 480016. These genes and their flanking markers, and selected common wheat lines with the genes should be valuable for diversifying resistance genes used in breeding wheat cultivars with stripe rust resistance."

"25634104","abstracttext_key message","The diploid wheat stem rust resistance gene Sr21 confers temperature-sensitive resistance to isolates of the Ug99 group and maps to the middle of the long arm of chromosome 2A (m). A race of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, the causal pathogen of stem rust of wheat, known as Ug99, and its variants, are virulent to plants carrying stem rust resistance genes currently deployed in most wheat cultivars worldwide. Therefore, identification, mapping and deployment of effective resistance genes are critical to reduce this threat. Resistance gene Sr21 identified in diploid wheat T. monococcum can be effective against races from the Ug99 race group, but both susceptible and partial resistant reactions have been reported in previous studies. To clarify this conflicting information we screened four monogenic lines with Sr21 and four susceptible controls with 16 Pgt isolates including five isolates of the Ug99 race group under three different temperatures and three different photoperiods. We observed that, temperature influences the interaction between monogenic lines with Sr21 and Ug99 race group isolates, and may be one source of previous inconsistencies. This result indicates that, although Sr21 confers partial resistance against Ug99, its effectiveness can be modulated by environmental conditions and should not be deployed alone. Using two large diploid wheat-mapping populations (total 3,788 F2 plants) we mapped Sr21 approximately 50 cM from the centromere on the long arm of chromosome 2A(m) within a 0.20 cM interval flanked by sequence-based markers FD527726 and EX594406. The closely linked markers identified in this study will be useful to reduce the T. monococcum segments introgressed into common wheat, accelerate Sr21 deployment in wheat breeding programs, and facilitate the map-based cloning of this gene."

Fusarium head blight is a major wheat disease globally. A major FHB resistance gene, designated as Fhb7, derived from Thinopyrum ponticum, was earlier transferred to common wheat, but was not used in wheat breeding due to linkage drag. The aims of this study were to (1) saturate this FHB resistance gene region; (2) develop and characterize secondary translocation lines with shortened Thinopyrum segments carrying Fhb7 using ph1b; (3) pyramid Fhb7 and Fhb1 by marker-assisted selection. Fhb7 was mapped in a 1.7 cM interval that was flanked by molecular markers XsdauK66 and Xcfa2240 with SSR, diversity arrays technology, EST-derived and conserved markers. KS24-2 carrying Fhb7 was analyzed with molecular markers and genomic in situ hybridization, confirming it was a 7DS.7el2L Robertsonian translocation. To reduce the Thinopyrum chromatin segments carrying Fhb7, a BC1F2 population (Chinese Spring ph1bph1b*2/KS24-2) was developed and genotyped with the markers linked to Fhb7. Two new translocation lines (SDAU1881 and SDAU1886) carrying Fhb7 on shortened alien segments (approximately 16.1 and 17.3% of the translocation chromosome, respectively) were developed. Furthermore, four wheat lines (SDAU1902, SDAU1903, SDAU1904, and SDAU1906) with the pyramided markers flanking Fhb1 and Fhb7 were developed and the FHB responses indicated lines with mean NDS ranging from 1.3 to 1.6 had successfully combined Fhb7 and Fhb1. Three new molecular markers associated with Fhb7 were identified and validated in 35 common wheat varieties. The translocation lines with shortened alien segments carrying Fhb7 (and Fhb1) and the markers closely linked to Fhb7 will be useful for improving wheat scab resistance."

Chromosomal deletion lines are valuable tools for gene discovery and localization. The chromosome 6P of Agropyron cristatum (2n = 4x = 28, PPPP) confers many desirable agronomic traits to common wheat, such as higher grain number per spike, multiple fertile tiller number, and enhanced resistance to certain diseases. Although many elite genes from A. cristatum have been identified, their chromosomal locations were largely undetermined due to the lack of A. cristatum 6P deletion lines. In this study, various A. cristatum 6P deletion lines were developed using a wheat-A. cristatum 6P disomic addition line 4844-12 subjected to (60)Co-Î³ irradiation as well as an Aegilops cylindrica gametocidal chromosome. Twenty-six genetically stable A. cristatum 6P deletion lines in the genetic background of common wheat were obtained, and their genetic constitutions were elucidated by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers specific to A. cristatum chromosome 6P. Moreover, 255 novel chromosome 6P-specific STS markers were physically mapped to 14 regions of chromosome 6P. Field evaluation of leaf rust resistance of various deletion lines and BC1F2 populations indicated that the A.cristatum chromosome 6P-originated leaf rust resistance gene(s) was located in the region 6PS-0.81-1.00.

Previous studies showed that wheat-A. cristatum 2P disomic addition line II-9-3 displayed high resistance to powdery mildew, and the resistance was attributable to A. cristatum chromosome 2P. To utilize and physically map the powdery mildew resistance gene(s), 15 wheat-A. cristatum 2P translocation lines and three A. cristatum 2P deletion lines with different chromosomal segment sizes, obtained from II-9-3 using 60 Co-Î³ ray irradiation, were characterized using cytogenetic and molecular marker analysis. A. cristatum 2P chromosomal segments in the translocations were translocated to different wheat chromosomes, including 1A, 4A, 5A, 6A, 7A, 1B, 2B, 3B, 7B, 3D, 4D, and 6D. A physical map of the 2P chromosome was constructed with 82 STS markers, consisting of nine bins with 34 markers on 2PS and eight bins with 48 markers on 2PL. The BC 1 F 2 populations of seven wheat-A. cristatum 2P translocation lines (2PT-3, 2PT-4, 2PT-5, 2PT-6, 2PT-8, 2PT-9, and 2PT-10) were developed by self-pollination, tested with powdery mildew and genotyped with 2P-specific STS markers. From these results, the gene(s) conferring powdery mildew resistance was(were) located on 2PL bin FL 0.66-0.86 and 19 2P-specific markers were identified in this bin. Moreover, two new powdery mildew-resistant translocation lines (2PT-4 and 2PT-5) with small 2PL chromosome segments were obtained. The newly developed wheat lines with powdery mildew resistance and the closely linked molecular markers will be valuable for wheat disease breeding in the future."

"29510004","abstracttext","Despite a long history, the production of useful alien introgression lines in wheat remains difficult mainly due to linkage drag and incomplete genetic compensation. In addition, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of foreign chromatin on plant phenotype. Here, a comparison of the transcriptomes of barley, wheat and a wheat-barley 7HL addition line allowed the transcriptional impact both on 7HL genes of a non-native genetic background and on the wheat gene complement as a result of the presence of 7HL to be assessed. Some 42% (389/923) of the 7HL genes assayed were differentially transcribed, which was the case for only 3% (960/35Â 301) of the wheat gene complement. The absence of any transcript in the addition line of a suite of chromosome 7A genes implied the presence of a 36 Mbp deletion at the distal end of the 7AL arm; this deletion was found to be in common across the full set of Chinese Spring/Betzes barley addition lines. The remaining differentially transcribed wheat genes were distributed across the whole genome. The up-regulated barley genes were mostly located in the proximal part of the 7HL arm, while the down-regulated ones were concentrated in the distal part; as a result, genes encoding basal cellular functions tended to be transcribed, while those encoding specific functions were suppressed. An insight has been gained into gene transcription in an alien introgression line, thereby providing a basis for understanding the interactions between wheat and exotic genes in introgression materials."

"29860625","abstracttext_key message","One major and three minor QTLs for resistance to pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) were identified from a white wheat variety ""Danby."" The major QTL on chromosome 3A is TaPHS1, and the sequence variation in its promoter region was responsible for the PHS resistance. AdditiveâÃâadditive effects were detected between two minor QTLs on chromosomes 3B and 5A, which can greatly enhance the PHS resistance. Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) causes significant losses in yield and quality in wheat. White wheat is usually more susceptible to PHS than red wheat. Therefore, the use of none grain color-related PHS resistance quantitative trait loci (QTLs) is essential for the improvement in PHS resistance in white wheat. To identify PHS resistance QTLs in the white wheat cultivar ""Danby"" and determine their effects, a doubled haploid population derived from a cross of DanbyâÃâ""Tiger"" was genotyped using genotyping-by-sequencing markers and phenotyped for PHS resistance in two greenhouse and one field experiments. One major QTL corresponding to a previously cloned gene, TaPHS1, was consistently detected on the chromosome arm 3AS in all three experiments and explained 21.6-41.0% of the phenotypic variations. A SNP (SNP-222) in the promoter of TaPHS1 co-segregated with PHS in this mapping population and was also significantly associated with PHS in an association panel. Gene sequence comparison and gene expression analysis further confirmed that SNP-222 is most likely the causal mutation in TaPHS1 for PHS resistance in Danby in this study. In addition, two stable minor QTLs on chromosome arms 3BS and 5AL were detected in two experiments with allele effects consistently contributed by Danby, while one minor QTL on 2AS was detected in two environments with contradicted allelic effects. The two stable minor QTLs showed significant additiveâÃâadditive effects. The results demonstrated that pyramiding those three QTLs using breeder-friendly KASP markers developed in this study could greatly improve PHS resistance in white wheat."

"31091755","abstracttext","In this study, we generated transgenic durum wheat cv. Maali overexpressing the wheat plasma membrane aquaporin Td PIP2;1 gene under the control of Pr Td PIP2;1 promoter or under the constitutive PrCaMV35S promoter. Histochemical analysis of the fusion Pr Td PIP2;1:: Td PIP2;1::GusA in wheat plants showed that the Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) activity was detected in the leaves, stems and roots of stably transformed wheat T3 plants. Our results showed that transgenic wheat lines overexpressing the Td PIP2;1 gene exhibited improved germination rates and biomass production and retained low Na + and high K + concentrations in their shoots under high salt and osmotic stress conditions. In a long-term study under greenhouse conditions on salt or drought stress, transgenic Td PIP2;1 lines produced filled grains, whereas wild-type (WT) plants either died at the vegetative stage under salt stress or showed drastically reduced grain filling under drought stress. Performing real time RT-PCR experiments on wheat plants transformed with the fusion Pr Td PIP2;1::GusA, we showed an increase in the accumulation of GusA transcripts in the roots of plants challenged with salt and drought stress. Study of the antioxidant defence system in transgenic wheat Td PIP2;1 lines showed that these lines induced the antioxidative enzymes Catalase (CAT) and Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities more efficiently than the WT plants, which is associated with lower malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide contents. Taken together, these results indicate the high potential of the Td PIP2;1 gene for reducing water evaporation from leaves (water loss) in response to water deficit through the lowering of transpiration per unit leaf area (stomatal conductance) and engineering effective drought and salt tolerance in transgenic Td PIP2;1 lines."

"30374527","abstracttext_key message","A wheat-rye 4R chromosome disomic addition line with resistances to powdery mildew, stripe rust, sharp eyespot and high kernel number per spike was developed and characterized by molecular cytogenetic method as novel resistant germplasm. Rye (Secale cereale L.), a close relative of common wheat, is an important and valuable gene donor with multiple disease resistance for wheat improvement. However, resistance genes derived from rye have successively lost resistance to pathogens due to the coevolution of pathogen virulence and host resistance. Development and identification of new effective resistance gene sources from rye therefore are of special importance and urgency. In the present study, a wheat-rye line WR35 was produced through distant hybridization, embryo rescue culture, chromosome doubling and backcrossing. WR35 was then proven to be a new wheat-rye 4R disomic addition line using sequential GISH (genomic in situ hybridization), mc-FISH (multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization) and ND-FISH (non-denaturing FISH) with multiple probes, mc-GISH (multicolor GISH), rye chromosome arm-specific marker analysis and SLAF-seq (specific-locus amplified fragmentÂ sequencing) analysis. At the adult stage, WR35 exhibited high levels of resistance to the powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, Bgt) and stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, Pst) pathogens prevalent in China, and a highly virulent isolate of Rhizoctonia cerealis, the cause of wheat sharp eyespot. At the seedling stage, it was highly resistant to 22 of 23 Bgt isolates and four Pst races. Based on its disease responses to different pathogen isolates, WR35 may possess resistance gene(s) for powdery mildew, stripe rust and sharp eyespot, which differed from the known resistance genes from rye. In addition, WR35 was cytologically stable and produced high kernel number per spike. Therefore, WR35 with multi-disease resistances and desirable agronomic traits should serve as a promising bridging parent for wheat chromosome engineering breeding."

"30884266","abstracttext","Antimony (Sb) contamination of soils and its potential negative impact on crop yields have been recently recognized. To explore the effects of Sb(III) on wheat, responses of physical growth properties, enzyme activities and gene expression were examined. The root length was the most relevant indicator to exposure concentration, the root fresh weight was the most sensitive endpoint according to the comparison of the EC 50 (50% inhibitory effect concentration) values, and NRAMP1 gene expression at 1â¯mgâ¯L -1 was more sensitive than other genes. The genes HMA2 and IRT1 were upregulated but less sensitive than NRAMP1. Additionally, the antioxidant enzyme response was examined to explore Sb toxicity toward wheat. The glutathione (GSH) content in roots exposed to high concentrations of Sb(III) was higher than that in the control group, which indicated that GSH is involved in protecting wheat against the effects of Sb(III). Comparing the different antioxidant responses and correlations with malondialdehyde (MDA) in different tissues, super oxide dismutase (SOD) exhibited the main contribution to defense Sb(III) in roots; SOD and peroxidase (POD) were the major antioxidants in shoots. Gene expression of transporter proteins was a highly sensitive indicator of Sb toxicity in wheat and allowed for understanding the defense mechanism in wheat. The upregulation of HMA2 under Sb(III) expression was one kind of defense mechanism, which can induce efflux of heavy metals into the apoplast or vacuoles. Biomass and plant height results suggested that wheat may grow better than other crops under similar exposure due to the lower degree of Sb uptake. This work is the first to provide a wheat uptake model of Sb(III) under a wide concentration range as well as a perspective on the response to this stress at the molecular level."

"30818185","abstracttext","This paper investigates the physiological mechanism of the effect of delaying cucumber senescence on protein levels under the experimental model of monoculture and wheat intercropping. We analyzed cucumber roots for differential protein expression, and protein types were identified by core technology of proteomics. 45 differential proteins were identified as being differentially expressed between monoculture and intercropping of wheat, which were involved in carbohydrate metabolism, antioxidant and stress response, growth and development regulation, biological information transfer, and nucleic acid biosynthesis. The results showed the rate of photosynthesis of cucumber was increased under wheat intercropping pattern due to three enzymes being up-regulated. The respiration of cucumber was reduced when five enzymes were down-regulated. The antioxidant and resistant capacity of cucumber was enhanced significantly under wheat intercropping pattern because two enzymes were down-regulated while the activity of four other antioxidant enzymes was up-regulated. Intercropping wheat could delay the senescence of cucumber leaves by increasing the expression of IPT gene, reducing the expression of PAO and ETR2 gene, and inhibiting the expression of Cu/Zn-SOD and GS1 gene in later stages. Two proteins related to growth and development in cucumber were up-regulated, and one was down-regulated, while two proteins related to nucleic acid biosynthesis and chaperonin showed obvious down-regulation under wheat intercropping. Therefore, the growth and development was improved and senescence of cucumber could be delayed. Under intercropping pattern, the fresh weight, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate, and peroxidase activity of cucumber plants were higher than those of cucumber monoculture groups. Thus, the senescence of cucumber could be delayed under wheat intercropping by regulating its physiological mechanisms, such as by improving photosynthesis, reducing respiratory consumption, slowing the cell apoptosis rate, and enhancing the antioxidant and resistant capacity significantly, etc."

They were classified into eight classes based on the phylogenetic relationship among wheat, rice, and Arabidopsis, and their gene structure and conserved motif were similar in the same phylogenetic class. The 43 and 171 gene pairs were identified as tandem and segmental duplication genes respectively, and the Ka/Ks ratios of tandem and segmental duplication TaGST genes were less than 1 except segmental duplication gene pair TaGSTU24/TaGSTU154. The 59 TaGST genes were identified to have syntenic relationships with 28 OsGST genes. The expression profiling involved in 15 tissues and biotic and abiotic stresses suggested the different expression and response patterns of the TaGST genes. Furthermore, the qRT-PCR data showed that GST could response to abiotic stresses and hormones extensively in wheat."
"31842737","abstracttext_conclusions","In this study, a large GST family with 330 members was identified from the wheat genome. Duplication events containing tandem and segmental duplication contributed to the expansion of TaGST family, and duplication genes might undergo extensive purifying selection. The expression profiling and cis-elements in promoter region of 330 TaGST genes implied their roles in growth and development as well as adaption to stressful environments. The qRT-PCR data of 14 TaGST genes revealed that they could respond to different abiotic stresses and hormones, especially salt stress and abscisic acid. In conclusion, this study contributed to the further functional analysis of GST genes family in wheat."

"31782596","abstracttext","The plant hormone group, the cytokinins, is implicated in both qualitative and quantitative components of yield. Cytokinins have opposing actions in shoot and root growth-actions shown to involve cytokinin dehydrogenase (CKX), the enzyme that inactivates cytokinin. We revise and provide unambiguous names for the CKX gene family members in wheat, based on the most recently released wheat genome database, IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 & v2.0. We review expression data of CKX gene family members in wheat, revealing tissue-specific gene family member expression as well as sub-genome-specific expression. Manipulation of CKX in cereals shows clear impacts on yield, root growth and orientation, and Zn nutrition, but this also emphasizes the necessity to unlink promotive effects on grain yield from negative effects of cytokinin on root growth and uptake of mineral nutrients, particularly Zn and Fe. Wheat is the most widely grown cereal crop globally, yet is under-research compared with rice and maize. We highlight gaps in our knowledge of the involvement of CKX for wheat. We also highlight the necessity for accurate analysis of endogenous cytokinins, acknowledging why this is challenging, and provide examples where inadequate analyses of endogenous cytokinins have led to unjustified conclusions. We acknowledge that the allohexaploid nature of bread wheat poses challenges in terms of uncovering useful mutations. However, we predict TILLING followed by whole-exome sequencing will uncover informative mutations and we indicate the potential for stacking mutations within the three genomes to modify yield components. We model a wheat ideotype based on CKX manipulation."
"31617659","articletitle","Regulatory changes in TaSNAC8-6A are associated with drought tolerance in wheat seedlings."
"31617659","abstracttext","Wheat is a staple crop produced in arid and semi-arid areas worldwide, and its production is frequently compromised by water scarcity. Thus, increased drought tolerance is a priority objective for wheat breeding programmes, and among their targets, the NAC transcription factors have been demonstrated to contribute to plant drought response. However, natural sequence variations in these genes have been largely unexplored for their potential roles in drought tolerance. Here, we conducted a candidate gene association analysis of the stress-responsive NAC gene subfamily in a wheat panel consisting of 700 varieties collected worldwide. We identified a drought responsive gene, TaSNAC8-6A, that is tightly associated with drought tolerance in wheat seedlings. Further analysis found that a favourable allele TaSNAC8-6A In-313 , carrying an insertion in the ABRE promoter motif, is targeted by TaABFs and confers enhanced drought-inducible expression of TaSNAC8-6A in drought-tolerant genotypes. Transgenic wheat and Arabidopsis TaSNAC8-6A overexpression lines exhibited enhanced drought tolerance through induction of auxin- and drought-response pathways, confirmed by transcriptomic analysis, that stimulated lateral root development, subsequently improving water-use efficiency. Taken together, our findings reveal that natural variation in TaSNAC8-6A and specifically the TaSNAC8-6A In-313 allele strongly contribute to wheat drought tolerance and thus represent a valuable genetic resource for improvement of drought-tolerant germplasm for wheat production."

"32122306","abstracttext_results","In total, 1285 and 263 full-length CYP450s were identified in wheat and maize, respectively. According to standard nomenclature, wheat CYP450s (TaCYP450s) were categorized into 45 families, while maize CYP450s (ZmCYP450s) into 43 families. A comprehensive analysis of wheat and maize CYP450s, involved in functional domains, conserved motifs, phylogeny, gene structures, chromosome locations and duplicated events was performed. The result showed that each family/subfamily in both species exhibited characteristic features, suggesting their phylogenetic relationship and the potential divergence in their functions. Functional divergence analysis at the amino acid level of representative clans CYP51, CYP74 and CYP97 in wheat, maize and rice identified some critical amino acid sites that are responsible for functional divergence of a gene family. Expression profiles of Ta-, ZmCYP450s were investigated using RNA-seq data, which contribute to infer the potential functions of the genes during development and stress responses. We found in both species CYP450s had preferential expression in specific tissues, and many tissue-specific genes were identified. Under water-deficit condition, 82 and 39 significantly differentially expressed CYP450s were respectively detected in wheat and maize. These genes may have some roles in protecting plants against drought damage. Thereinto, fourteen CYP450s were selected to validate their expression level through qRT-PCR. To further elucidating molecular mechanisms of CYP450 action, gene co-expression network was constructed. In total, 477 TaCYP450s were distributed in 22 co-expression modules, and some co-expressed genes that likely take part in the same biochemical pathway were identified. For instance, the expression of TaCYP74A98_4D was highly correlated with TaLOX9, TaLOX36, TaLOX39, TaLOX44 and TaOPR8, and all of them may be involved in jasmonate (JA) biosynthesis. TaCYP73A201_3A showed coexpression with TaPAL1.25, TaCCoAOMT1.2, TaCOMT.1, TaCCR1.6 and TaLAC5, which probably act in the wheat stem and/or root lignin synthesis pathway."

"2203788","abstracttext","The initial step in the conjugation of ubiquitin to substrate proteins involves the activation of ubiquitin by ubiquitin activating enzyme, E1. Previously, we purified and characterized multiple species of E1 from wheat germ. We now describe the isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone encoding E1 from wheat. This clone (UBA1) was isolated from a cDNA expression library with anti-wheat E1 antibodies. It contained an open reading frame coding for 1051 amino acids and directed the synthesis of a protein that comigrated with a wheat germ E1 of 117 kDa. UBA1 was confirmed as encoding E1 by (i) comparison of the peptide map of the protein product of UBA1 synthesized in Escherichia coli with that of purified E1 from wheat, and (ii) amino acid sequence identity of peptides generated from purified E1 with regions of the derived amino acid sequence of UBA1. The isolation of two additional cDNAs closely related to UBA1 indicated that E1 was encoded by a small gene family in wheat. Nonetheless, a single poly(A+) mRNA size class of 4 kilobases hybridized with UBA1. When expressed in E. coli, the product of UBA1 catalyzed the formation of a thiol ester linkage between ubiquitin and an ubiquitin carrier protein. The ability of E. coli containing UBA1 to synthesize an active protein will allow us to identify domains important for E1 function using in vitro mutagenesis."

"2762145","abstracttext","In the course of a systematic survey of wheat mitochondrial tRNA genes, we have sequenced chloroplast-like serine (trnS-GGA), phenylalanine (trnF-GAA) and cysteine (trnC-GCA) tRNA genes and their flanking regions. These genes are remnants of 'promiscuous' chloroplast DNA that has been incorporated into wheat mtDNA in the course of its evolution. Each gene differs by one or a few nucleotides from the authentic chloroplast homolog previously characterized in wheat or other plants, and each could potentially encode a functional tRNA whose secondary structure shows no deviations from the generalized model. To determine whether these chloroplast-like tRNA genes are actually expressed, wheat mitochondrial tRNAs were resolved by a series of polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses, after being specifically end-labeled in vitro by 3'-CCA addition mediated by wheat tRNA nucleotidyltransferase. Subsequent direct RNA sequence analysis identified prominent tRNA species corresponding to the mitochondrial and not the chloroplast trnS, trnF and trnC genes. This analysis also revealed chloroplast-like elongator methionine, asparagine and tryptophan tRNAs. Our results suggest that at least some chloroplast-like tRNA genes in wheat mtDNA are transcribed, with transcripts undergoing processing, post-transcriptional modification and 3'-CCA addition, to produce mature tRNAs that may participate in mitochondrial protein synthesis."

"11442059","abstracttext","The high-mobility-group (HMG) chromosomal protein wheat HMGa was purified to homogeneity and tested for its binding characteristics to double-stranded DNA. Wheat HMGa was able to bind to P268, an A/T-rich fragment derived from the pea plastocyanin gene promoter, producing a small mobility shift in gel retardation assays where the bound complex was sensitive to addition of proteinase K but resistant to heat treatment of the protein, consistent with the identity of wheat HMGa as a putative HMG-I/Y protein. Gel retardation assays and southwestern hybridization analysis revealed that wheat HMGa could selectively interact with the DNA polynucleotides poly(dA).poly(dT), poly(dAdT).poly(dAdT), and poly(dG).poly(dC), but not with poly(dGdC).poly(dGdC). Surface plasmon resonance analysis determined the kinetic and affinity constants of sensor chip-immobilized wheat HMGa for double-stranded DNA 10-mers, revealing a good affinity of the protein for various dinucleotide combinations, except that of alternating GC sequence. Thus contrary to prior reports of a selectivity of wheat HMGa for A/T-rich DNA, the protein appears to be able to interact with sequences containing guanine and cytosine residues as well, except where G/C residues alternate directly in the primary sequence."

"10831851","abstracttext","The plant knotted1 (kn1)-like homeobox genes are known to play important roles in the maintenance of shoot apical meristem (SAM), determination of cell fate and differentiation of vegetative tissues. To study structural diversity of the three homologous loci encoding a KN1-like homeobox protein in the hexaploid wheat genome, we isolated clones from a cDNA library of young spikes of Japanese common wheat cultivar 'Norin 26'. Three different but highly homologous cDNAs were isolated and their sequences were determined. The mean homology of the deduced amino acid sequences was 96% as compared to the barley ortholog KNOX3. The wheat kn1-like homeobox proteins named WKNOX1 are encoded by a single set of homologous genes on the homologous group 4 chromosomes in the three component genomes of common wheat, i.e. 4A, 4B and 4D. The nucleotide sequence data and the Southern blot pattern suggested that the three homologous loci of wknox1 genes are highly conserved through polyploid evolution of wheat. They were expressed in SAM-containing shoots and young spikes but not in developed leaves, glumes and lemmas and callus tissues. The ectopic expression of the wknox1 was observed in lemma of wheat Hooded (Hd) mutants. The result suggested that the Hd gene is a dominant allele of the wknox1 locus on chromosome 4A."

Using GUS-transformed isolates of T. yallundae as inoculum, we determined that wheat lines carrying Th. intermedium chromosome 4 Ai#2 or the short arm of chromosome 4 Ai#2 were as resistant to the pathogen as the eyespot-resistant wheat- Th. ponticum chromosome substitution line SS 767 (PI 611939) and winter wheat cultivar Madsen, which carries gene Pch 1 for eyespot resistance. Chromosome 4 E from Th. elongatum and chromosome 4 J from Th. bessarabicum did not confer resistance to T. yallundae. Genome-specific PCR primers confirmed the presence of Thinopyrum chromatin in these wheat- Thinopyrum lines. Genomic in situ hybridization using an St genomic probe from Pseudoroegneria strigosa demonstrated that chromosome 4 Ai#2 belongs to the J(s) genome of Thinopyrum. The eyespot resistance in the wheat- Th. intermedium lines is thus controlled by the short arm of this J(s) chromosome. This is the first report of resistance to T. yallundae controlled by a J(s) genome chromosome of Th. intermedium."

"20199626","abstracttext","Reproductive stage water stress leads to spikelet sterility in wheat. Whereas drought stress at anthesis affects mainly grain size, stress at the young microspore stage of pollen development is characterized by abortion of pollen development and reduction in grain number. We identified genetic variability for drought tolerance at the reproductive stage. Drought-tolerant wheat germplasm is able to maintain carbohydrate accumulation in the reproductive organs throughout the stress treatment. Starch depletion in the ovary of drought-sensitive wheat is reversible upon re-watering and cross-pollination experiments indicate that the ovary is more resilient than the anther. The effect on anthers and pollen fertility is irreversible, suggesting that pollen sterility is the main cause of grain loss during drought conditions in wheat. The difference in storage carbohydrate accumulation in drought-sensitive and drought-tolerant wheat is correlated with differences in sugar profiles, cell wall invertase gene expression and expression of fructan biosynthesis genes in anther and ovary (sucrose : sucrose 1-fructosyl-transferase, 1-SST; sucrose : fructan 6-fructosyl-transferase, 6-SFT). Our results indicate that the ability to control and maintain sink strength and carbohydrate supply to anthers may be the key to maintaining pollen fertility and grain number in wheat and this mechanism may also provide protection against other abiotic stresses."

"19924390","abstracttext","Aquaporins are water channel proteins that control the flow of water across cellular membranes and play vital roles in all aspects of plant-water relations. Our previous identification of 35 wheat PIP and TIP aquaporin genes showed they formed a large family with many conserved features that are thought to be important in structure and function. The present work focussed on determining the positions of these genes in the wheat genome in order to help investigate their functions in water uptake and transport. Genomic locations of wheat PIPs and TIPs were predicted using a number of reported rice-wheat comparative maps and additional in silico approaches. Physical mapping of select genes utilising aneuploid stocks and progenitor DNAs placed these on chromosomes 2B, 2D, 6B and 7B and helped to clarify the individual genes and homoeologues. The compilation of all in silico and physical mapping work confirmed many of the orthologous relationships between wheat and rice and/or barley genes, and synteny in the related areas of genome. These results further reinforce that wheat PIP and TIP proteins are most likely to have similar functions to those closely related in rice, including water permeability and abiotic stress response, and provide important tools for future investigations into the involvement of this complex gene family in traits related to plant-water relations and osmotic stress response."

"21844700","abstracttext","Complex groups of proteins determine the unique functional properties of wheat flour and are sometimes responsible for food intolerances and allergies in individuals that consume wheat products. Transgenic approaches can be used to explore the functions of different flour proteins, but are limited to the few wheat cultivars that can be transformed and also by the lack of detailed information about genes and proteins expressed in grain from those cultivars. The US bread wheat Butte 86 has been extensively characterized and a comprehensive proteome map was developed in which flour proteins were distinguished by mass spectrometry and associated with specific gene sequences. Here, this information has been used to design an RNA interference construct to silence the expression of genes encoding omega gliadins that trigger the food allergy wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA). The construct was introduced into immature embryos from Butte 86 using biolistics and bialaphos-resistant plants were regenerated. Stable transformation and inheritance of the transgene were confirmed by PCR. Analysis of proteins in grain from transgenic plants demonstrated that the omega-5 gliadins were either absent or substantially reduced relative to non-transformed controls. The ability to genetically transform Butte 86 makes it possible to alter flour composition in a targeted manner in a commercial US wheat cultivar and should accelerate future research on flour quality and immunogenic potential."

"22942719","abstracttext","The union of different genomes in the same nucleus frequently results in hybrid genotypes with improved genome plasticity related to both genome remodeling events and changes in gene expression. Most modern cereal crops are polyploid species. Triticale, synthesized by the cross between wheat and rye, constitutes an excellent model to study polyploidization functional implications. We intend to attain a deeper knowledge of dispersed repetitive sequence involvement in parental genome reshuffle in triticale and in wheat-rye addition lines that have the entire wheat genome plus each rye chromosome pair. Through Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis with OPH20 10-mer primer we unraveled clear alterations corresponding to the loss of specific bands from both parental genomes. Moreover, the sequential nature of those events was revealed by the increased absence of rye-origin bands in wheat-rye addition lines in comparison with triticale. Remodeled band sequencing revealed that both repetitive and coding genome domains are affected in wheat-rye hybrid genotypes. Additionally, the amplification and sequencing of pSc20H internal segments showed that the disappearance of parental bands may result from restricted sequence alterations and unraveled the involvement of wheat/rye related repetitive sequences in genome adjustment needed for hybrid plant stabilization."

"24727789","abstracttext","Flavonoids are the low molecular weight polyphenolic secondary metabolic compounds, and have various functions in growth, development, reproduction, and stress defense. However, little is known about the roles of the key enzymes in the flavonoids biosynthesis pathway in response to drought stress in winter wheat. Here, we investigated the expression pattern of flavonoids biosynthesis genes and accumulation of flavonoids in wheat leaves under drought stress. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that there were a rapid increase in expression levels of TaCHS, TaCHI, TaF3H, TaFNS, TaFLS, TaDFR, and TaANS under drought stress in two wheat cultivars Aikang 58 (AK) and Chinese Spring (CS). The cultivar CS exhibited higher genes expression levels of TaCHS, TaCHI, TaF3H, TaFLS, TaDFR, and TaANS, and the cultivar AK showed a higher expression level of TaFNS gene during drought treatment. The increase rates of genes expression were superior in AK compared to CS. Total phenolics content, total flavonoids content, anthocyanin content, and schaftoside content in wheat leaves were enhanced during drought treatment and cultivar CS had a relative higher accumulation. These results suggest that the flavonoids pathway genes expression and accumulation of flavonoids compounds may be closely related to drought tolerant in wheat. Further, flavonoids response mechanism may be different between wheat cultivars."

"24073880","abstracttext","Fungal cell-wall chitin is a well-recognized pathogen-associated molecular pattern. Recognition of chitin in plants by pattern recognition receptors activates pathogen-triggered immunity (PTI). In Arabidopsis, this process is mediated by a plasma membrane receptor kinase, CERK1, whereas in rice, a receptor-like protein, CEBiP, in addition to CERK1 is required. Secreted chitin-binding lysin motif (LysM) containing fungal effector proteins, such as Ecp6 from the biotrophic fungus Cladosporium fulvum, have been reported to interfere with PTI. Here, we identified wheat homologues of CERK1 and CEBiP and investigated their role in the interaction with the nonbiotrophic pathogen of wheat Mycosphaerella graminicola (synonym Zymoseptoria tritici). We show that silencing of either CERK1 or CEBiP in wheat, using Barley stripe mosaic virus-mediated virus-induced gene silencing, is sufficient in allowing leaf colonization by the normally nonpathogenic M. graminicola Mg3LysM (homologue of Ecp6) deletion mutant, while the Mg1LysM deletion mutant was fully pathogenic toward both silenced and wild-type wheat leaves. These data indicate that Mg3LysM is important for fungal evasion of PTI in wheat leaf tissue and that both CERK1 and CEBiP are required for activation of chitin-induced defenses, a feature conserved between rice and wheat, and perhaps, also in other cereal species."

"24273426","abstracttext","The Ppd-A1 genotype of 240 Japanese wheat cultivars and 40 foreign cultivars was determined using a PCR-based method. Among Japanese cultivars, only 12 cultivars, all of which were Hokkaido winter wheat, carried the Ppd-A1a allele, while this allele was not found in Hokkaido spring wheat cultivars or Tohoku-Kyushu cultivars. Cultivars with a photoperiod-insensitive allele headed 6.9-9.8 days earlier in Kanto and 2.5 days earlier in Hokkaido than photoperiod-sensitive cultivars. The lower effect of photoperiod-insensitive alleles observed in Hokkaido could be due to the longer day-length at the spike formation stage compared with that in Kanto. Pedigree analysis showed that 'Purple Straw' and 'Tohoku 118' were donors of Ppd-A1a and Ppd-D1a in Hokkaido wheat cultivars, respectively. Wheat cultivars recently developed in Hokkaido carry photoperiod-insensitive alleles at a high frequency. For efficient utilization of Ppd-1 alleles in the Hokkaido wheat-breeding program, the effect of Ppd-1 on growth pattern and grain yield should be investigated. Ppd-A1a may be useful as a unique gene source for fine tuning the heading time in the Tohoku-Kyushu region since the effect of Ppd-A1a on photoperiod insensitivity appears to differ from the effect of Ppd-B1a and Ppd-D1a."

"24149340","abstracttext","Cysteine-rich receptor kinases (CRKs) belong to the receptor-like kinase family. Little is known about CRK genes in wheat. We isolated a wheat CRK gene TaCRK1 from Rhizoctonia cerealis-resistant wheat CI12633 based on a differentially expressed sequence identified by RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis. TaCRK1 was more highly expressed in CI12633 than in susceptible Wenmai 6. Transcription of TaCRK1 in wheat was induced in CI12633 after R. cerealis infection and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. The deduced TaCRK1 protein contained a signal peptide, two DUF26 domains, a transmembrane domain, and a serine/threonine protein kinase domain. Transient expression of a green fluorescence protein fused with TaCRK1 in wheat and onion indicated that TaCRK1 may localize to plasma membranes. Characterization of TaCRK1 silencing induced by virus-mediated method in CI12633 showed that the downregulation of TaCRK1 transcript did not obviously impair resistance to R. cerealis. This study paves the way to further CRK research in wheat."

"24202596","abstracttext","Sears' phlb mutant was used successfully for the first time to induce pairing and recombination between specific barley chromosomes and their wheat homoeologues. Pairing was induced in specially constructed genetic stocks having 19 pairs of wheat chromosomes and triply monosomic for either barley chromosome arm 6HL or 3HL, a related wheat chromosome, and chromosome 5B of wheat carrying the phlb mutation. Wheat-barley recombinant chromosomes were isolated from among the progeny obtained from self-fertilization of the triple monosomic stocks, by screening for dissociation of biochemical markers on the barley arms. Glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), aconitase hydratase (ACO), and dipeptidase (DIP) isozymes were used to select recombinants involving the 6HL arm, and esterase (EST) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) were used for the 3HL arm. Altogether, six recombinants involving 6HL (1.4%) and six involving 3HL (1.1%) were isolated. These wheat-barley recombinant chromosomes are being used to construct a detailed gene order map of barley based on biochemical and molecular markers."

In order to clarify the effect of the avenin-like b proteins on the functional properties of wheat flour, the functional and biochemical properties of wheat flour were analyzed in three transgenic wheat lines overexpressing the avenin - like b gene using the sodium dodecyl sulfate sedimentation (SDSS) test, Mixograph and size exclusion-high performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC) analysis. The results of the SDSS test and Mixograph analysis demonstrated that the overexpression of avenin-like b proteins in transgenic lines led to significantly increased SDSS volume and improved flour mixing properties. The results of SE-HPLC analysis of the gluten proteins in wheat flour demonstrated that the improvement in transgenic line flour properties was associated with the increased proportion of large polymeric proteins due to the incorporation of overexpressed avenin-like b proteins into the glutenin polymers. These results could help to understand the influence and mechanism of avenin-like b proteins on the functional properties of wheat flour."

"24710882","abstracttext","To identify and locate rye DNA sequences homologous to three wheat c-DNAs (wali1, wali2 and wali5) whose expression is induced by aluminium (Al) stress, we designed three pairs of specific primers. They were used in the amplification of genomic DNA from wheat-rye disomic addition lines. The wali2 pair of primers amplified a 878-bp rye DNA fragment (rali2) located on chromosomes 4R and 7R that showed 79.37% homology with the corresponding wheat c-DNA. RAPD fragments were also used as genetic markers. We located 22 different RAPDs distributed on 11 different rye chromosome arms using wheat-rye disomic and ditelocentric addition lines. Thirteen of these markers were located on the chromosomes 3R, 4R and 6R, which also carry aluminium-tolerance genes. The OPA08 415 and OPR01 600 RAPD markers, located on the 6RL and 6RS chromosome arms, respectively, were converted to SCAR markers (SCA08 415 and SCR01 600 ) and linked to Alt1 gene (SCR01 600 -2.1âcM-Alt1-33.5âcM-SCA08 415 ). We propose that the chromosomal location of RAPDs and SCARs using wheat-rye addition lines is a source of DNA markers linked to aluminium-tolerance loci and offers a valuable strategy in marker-assisted selection for the introgression of tolerance genes in wheat."

"25854602","abstracttext_main conclusion","TaCCoAOMT1 is located in wheat chromosome 7A and highly expressed in stem and root. It is important for lignin biosynthesis, and associated with stem maturity but not lodging resistance. Caffeoyl coenzyme A 3-O-methyltransferases (CCoAOMTs) are one important class of enzymes to carry out the transfer of the methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to the hydroxyl group, and play important roles in lignin and flavonoids biosynthesis. In the present study, sequences for CCoAOMT from the wheat genome were analyzed. One wheat CCoAOMT that belonged to bona fide subclade involved in lignin biosynthesis, namely TaCCoAOMT1, was obtained by the prokaryotic expression in E. coli. The three-dimensional structure prediction showed a highly similar structure of TaCCoAOMT1 with MsCCoAOMT. Recombinant TaCCoAOMT1 protein could only use caffeoyl CoA and 5-hydroxyferuloyl CoA as effective substrates and caffeoyl CoA as the best substrate. TaCCoAOMT1 had a narrow optimal pH and thermal stability. The TaCCoAOMT1 gene was highly expressed in wheat stem and root tissues, paralleled CCoAOMT enzyme activity. TaCCoAOMT1 mRNA abundance and enzyme activity increased linearly with stem maturity, but showed little difference between wheat lodging-resistant (H4546) and lodging-sensitive (C6001) cultivars in elongation, heading and milky stages. These data suggest that TaCCoAOMT1 is an important CCoAOMT for lignin biosynthesis that is critical for stem development, but not directly associated with lodging-resistant trait in wheat."

"26078810","abstracttext","Aluminum ions are especially toxic to plants in acidic soils. Here we present evidences that SO2 protects germinating wheat grains against aluminum stress. SO2 donor (NaHSO3/Na2SO3) pretreatment at 1.2âmM reduced the accumulation of superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and malondialdehyde, enhanced the activities of guaiacol peroxidase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase, and decreased the activity of lipoxygenase in germinating wheat grains exposed to Al stress. We also observed higher accumulation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in SO2-pretreated grain, suggesting the tight relation between sulfite and sulfide. Wheat grains geminated in water for 36âh were pretreated with or without 1âmM SO2 donor for 12âh prior to exposure to Al stress for 48âh and the ameliorating effects of SO2 on wheat radicles were studied. SO2 donor pretreatment reduced the content of reactive oxygen species, protected membrane integrity, and reduced Al accumulation in wheat radicles. Gene expression analysis showed that SO2 donor pretreatment decreased the expression of Al-responsive genes TaWali1, TaWali2, TaWali3, TaWali5, TaWali6, and TaALMT1 in radicles exposed to Al stress. These results suggested that SO2 could increase endogenous H2S accumulation and the antioxidant capability and decrease endogenous Al content in wheat grains to alleviate Al stress."

"26892368","abstracttext","Salt stress dramatically reduces crop yield and quality, but the molecular mechanisms underlying salt tolerance remain largely unknown. To explore the wheat transcriptional response to salt stress, we performed high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of 10-day old wheat roots under normal condition and 6, 12, 24 and 48âh after salt stress (HASS) in both a salt-tolerant cultivar and salt-sensitive cultivar. The results demonstrated global gene expression reprogramming with 36,804 genes that were up- or down-regulated in wheat roots under at least one stress condition compared with the controls and revealed the specificity and complexity of the functional pathways between the two cultivars. Further analysis showed that substantial expression partitioning of homeologous wheat genes occurs when the plants are subjected to salt stress, accounting for approximately 63.9% (2,537) and 66.1% (2,624) of the homeologous genes in 'Chinese Spring' (CS) and 'Qing Mai 6' (QM). Interestingly, 143 salt-responsive genes have been duplicated and tandemly arrayed on chromosomes during wheat evolution and polyploidization events, and the expression patterns of 122 (122/143, 85.3%) tandem duplications diverged dynamically over the time-course of salinity exposure. In addition, constitutive expression or silencing of target genes in Arabidopsis and wheat further confirmed our high-confidence salt stress-responsive candidates."

As the wheat parent was susceptible to leaf rust, the transfer of resistance was easily recognizable in the progenies. Three different partial amphiploid lines with leaf rust resistance were selected from the wheat/Thinopyrum hybrid derivatives by multicolour genomic in situ hybridization. Chromosome counting on the partial amphiploids revealed 58 chromosomes (18 wheatgrass) in line 194, 56 (14 wheatgrass) in line 195 and 54 (12 wheatgrass) in line 196. The wheat chromosomes present in these lines were identified and the wheatgrass chromosomes were characterized by fluorescence in situ hybridization using the repetitive DNA probes Afa-family, pSc119.2 and pTa71. The 3D wheat chromosome was missing from the lines. Molecular marker analysis showed the presence of the Lr24 leaf rust resistance gene in lines 195 and 196.

"26712825","abstracttext","Seed size is an important agronomic trait and a major component of seed yield in wheat. However, little is known about the genes and mechanisms that determine the final seed size in wheat. Here, we isolated TaCYP78A5, the orthologous gene of Arabidopsis CYP78A5/KLUH in wheat, from wheat cv. Shaan 512 and demonstrated that the expression of TaCYP78A5 affects seed size. TaCYP78A5 encodes the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 78A5 protein in wheat and rescued the phenotype of the Arabidopsis deletion mutant cyp78a5. By affecting the extent of integument cell proliferation in the developing ovule and seed, TaCYP78A5 influenced the growth of the seed coat, which appears to limit seed growth. TaCYP78A5 silencing caused a 10% reduction in cell numbers in the seed coat, resulting in a 10% reduction in seed size in wheat cv. Shaan 512. By contrast, the overexpression of TaCYP78A5 increased the number of cells in the seed coat, resulting in seed enlargement of ~11-35% in Arabidopsis. TaCYP78A5 activity was positively correlated with the final seed size. However, TaCYP78A5 overexpression significantly reduced seed set in Arabidopsis, possibly due to an ovule development defect. TaCYP78A5 also influenced embryo development by promoting embryo integument cell proliferation during seed development. Accordingly, a working model of the influence of TaCYP7A5 on seed size was proposed. This study provides direct evidence that TaCYP78A5 affects seed size and is a potential target for crop improvement."

"27402341","abstracttext","Goat grasses (Aegilops spp.) contributed to the evolution of bread wheat and are important sources of genes and alleles for modern wheat improvement. However, their use in alien introgression breeding is hindered by poor knowledge of their genome structure and a lack of molecular tools. The analysis of large and complex genomes may be simplified by dissecting them into single chromosomes via flow cytometric sorting. In some species this is not possible due to similarities in relative DNA content among chromosomes within a karyotype. This work describes the distribution of GAA and ACG microsatellite repeats on chromosomes of the U, M, S and C genomes of Aegilops, and the use of microsatellite probes to label the chromosomes in suspension by fluorescence inÂ situ hybridization (FISHIS). Bivariate flow cytometric analysis of chromosome DAPI fluorescence and fluorescence of FITC-labelled microsatellites made it possible to discriminate all chromosomes and sort them with negligible contamination by other chromosomes. DNA of purified chromosomes was used as a template for polymerase chain reation (PCR) using Conserved Orthologous Set (COS) markers with known positions on wheat A, B and D genomes. Wheat-Aegilops macrosyntenic comparisons using COS markers revealed significant rearrangements in the U and C genomes, while the M and S genomes exhibited structure similar to wheat. Purified chromosome fractions provided an attractive resource to investigate the structure and evolution of the Aegilops genomes, and the COS markers assigned to Aegilops chromosomes will facilitate alien gene introgression into wheat."

FISH was performed to localize the satellite DNAs on chromosomes of wheat and selected Aegilops species. The FISH signals for satellite DNAs on chromosome 5Mg were generally associated with constitutive heterochromatin regions corresponding to C-band-positive chromatin including telomeric, pericentromeric, centromeric, and interstitial regions of all the 14 chromosome pairs of Ae. geniculata. Most satellite DNAs also generated FISH signals on wheat chromosomes and provided diagnostic chromosome arm-specific cytogenetic markers that significantly improved chromosome identification in wheat. The newly identified satellite DNA CL36 produced localized Mg genome chromosome-specific FISH signals in Ae. geniculata and in the M genome of the putative diploid donor species Ae. comosa subsp. subventricosa but not in Ae. comosa subsp. comosa, suggesting that the Mg genome of Ae. geniculata was probably derived from subsp. subventricosa."

However, to date the genetic architecture of ALP genes is unclear, making it impossible to be utilized in wheat breeding. In the current study, three genes of type-b ALPs were identified and mapped to chromosomes 7AS, 4AL and 7DS. The coding gene sequence of both TaALP-7A and TaALP-7D was 855 bp long, encoding two identical homologous 284 amino acid long proteins. TaALP-4A was 858 bp long, encoding a 285 amino acid protein variant. Three alleles were identified for TaALP-7A and four for TaALP-4A. TaALP-7A alleles were of two types: type-1, which includes TaALP-7A1 andTaALP-7A2, encodes mature proteins, while type-2, represented byTaALP-7A3, contains a stop codon in the coding region and thus does not encode a mature protein. Dough quality testing of 102 wheat cultivars established a highly significant association of the type-1 TaALP-7A allele with better wheat processing quality. This allelic effects were confirmed among a range of commercial wheat cultivars. Our research makes the ALP be the first of such genetic variation source that can be readily utilized in wheat breeding."

Effects of DBD plasma on wheat seed germination, seedling growth, osmotic-adjustment products, lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidant enzyme activity, abscisic acid, and drought resistant related genes expression under drought stress were investigated. The changes of the wheat seed coat before and after the DBD plasma treatment were explored. Experimental results showed that the DBD plasma treatment could alleviate the adverse effects of drought stress on wheat seed germination and seedling growth; the germination potential and germination rate increased by 27.2% and 27.6%, and the root length and shoot length of the wheat seedlings also increased. Proline and soluble sugar levels under drought stress were improved after the DBD plasma treatment, whereas the malondialdehyde content decreased. ROS contents under drought stress were reduced after the DBD plasma treatment, whereas the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase were promoted. DBD plasma treatment promoted abscisic acid generation in wheat seedlings, and it also regulated functional gene LEA1 and stimulated regulation genes SnRK2 and P5CS to resist drought stress.

Negative effect of 1Ug is probably associated with variation in number and position of the tripeptide repeat motif in the high molecular weight glutenin (HMW-G) gene. To utilize the positive potential of 1Mg chromosome, three disomic substitution lines (DSLs) 1Mg(1A), 1Mg(1B) and 1Mg(1D) were created.

These newly developed molecular markers allowed the detection of Th. ponticum DNA in a variety of materials specifically and steadily at high throughput. According to the hybridization signal pattern, the eight Th. ponticum-specific probes could be divided into two groups. The first group including five dispersed repetitive sequence probes could identify Th. ponticum chromatin more sensitively and accurately than genomic in situ hybridization (GISH).

We conducted fluorescent inÂ situ hybridization/genomic inÂ situ hybridization-based meiotic/mitotic analysis, RNA-Seq and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS)-mediated assay of meiosis candidate genes. We show that heritability of stress tolerance concurred with increased euploidy frequency due to enhanced meiosis stability. We identified a set of candidate meiosis genes with altered expression in the stress-tolerant plants vs control, but the expression was similar to that of common wheat (cv Chinese Spring, CS). We demonstrate VIGS-mediated downregulation of individual candidate meiosis genes in CS is sufficient to confer an unstable meiosis phenotype mimicking the synthetic wheat. Our results suggest that heritable regulatory changes of preexisting meiosis genes may be hitchhiked as a spandrel of stress tolerance, which significantly improves meiosis stability in the synthetic wheat. Our findings implicate a plausible scenario that the meiosis machinery in hexaploid wheat may have already started to evolve at its onset stage."

"30790517","abstracttext","Here, we investigated changes in physiological characteristics in wheat affected by phytotoxic-aphid Schizaphis graminum feeding and nonphytotoxic-aphid Sitobion avenae feeding. We also determined whether shared host-mediated interspecific interactions occur between S. graminum and S. avenae. S. graminum feeding but not S. avenae feeding induced significant chlorophyll loss and hydrogen peroxide accumulation in wheat. Gene-expression analysis and GC/MS metabonomic results indicated that S. graminum infestation induced stronger salicylic acid mediated defense responses than S. avenae did and significantly increased the contents of several amino acids in wheat leaves. Feeding on wheat preinfested with S. graminum significantly increased the reproduction of both aphids and shortened the development time of S. graminum. However, olfactometer bioassays showed that the parasitoid wasp Aphidius gifuensis was more attracted to the odors of S. graminum infested wheat than to those of control and S. avenae infested wheat. This study demonstrates that S. graminum and S. avenae feeding induced different defense responses and changes in plant nutritional quality. Additionally, plant-mediated interactions occurred between these cereal aphids."

Single uredinial isolates (718 in total) were derived from the collections and tested for virulence phenotype on lines of Thatcher wheat that are near-isogenic for leaf rust resistance genes Lr1, Lr2a, Lr2c, Lr3a, Lr9, Lr16, Lr24, Lr26, Lr3ka, Lr11, Lr17a, Lr30, LrB, Lr10, Lr14a, Lr18, Lr2, and Lr28 and winter wheat lines with genes Lr41 and Lr42. In the United States in 2006, 56 virulence phenotypes were found. Virulence phenotypes TDBJG, TDBGG, and TDBJH were among the four most common phenotypes and were all virulent to resistance gene Lr24. These phenotypes were found throughout the Great Plains region. Phenotype MLDSD with virulence to Lr9, Lr17, and Lr41 was also widely distributed in the Great Plains. In the soft red winter wheat region of the southeastern states, phenotypes TCRKG and MBRKG with virulence to genes Lr11, Lr26, and Lr18 were among the common phenotypes. Virulence phenotypes with virulence to Lr16 were most frequent in the spring wheat region of the northern Great Plains. Virulence to Lr21 was not found in any of the tested isolates."
"32528501","articletitle","Wheat Argonaute 5 Functions in Aphid-Plant Interaction."
"32528501","abstracttext","Aphids feeding on plants experience similar responses to pathogens due to the prolonged and intimate contact with the plant. Diuraphis noxia is an economically important aphid pest on wheat that exhibits such an interaction. Studies on small RNA (sRNA) that regulate genes imparting resistance to wheat against D. noxia have predicted an Argonaute 5 ( TaAGO5 ) gene as possible role player in the resistance response. Functional characterization revealed that TaAGO5 is crucial in regulating the response to infestation by D. noxia . Knockdown of TaAGO5 by 22% in D. noxia resistant wheat resulted in a completely susceptible phenotype. The fecundity and stress levels of D. noxia feeding on these silenced plants were similar to aphids feeding on the susceptible controls. Thus, TaAGO5 is crucial in the defense response by wheat plants during aphid feeding and this is similar to Nicotiana benthaminia plants experiencing arthropod herbivory. Additionally, TaAGO5 was differentially regulated by the Barley mosaic virus (BMV) used in the functional characterization. This provides evidence that TaAGO5 could play a role during virus infection of wheat. The role of AGO5 proteins in plant responses to arthropod herbivory and virus infection is known for dicotyledonous plants. Here, we present data that indicate that this role of TaAGO5 is conserved in wheat and possibly for monocotyledonous plants. These observations extend our knowledge on the roles of AGO proteins in plant resistance."
"32477410","articletitle","Wheat Encodes Small, Secreted Proteins That Contribute to Resistance to Septoria Tritici Blotch."
"32477410","abstracttext","During plant-pathogen interactions, pathogens secrete many rapidly evolving, small secreted proteins (SSPs) that can modify plant defense and permit pathogens to colonize plant tissue. The fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici is the causal agent of Septoria tritici blotch (STB), one of the most important foliar diseases of wheat, globally. Z. tritici is a strictly apoplastic pathogen that can secrete numerous proteins into the apoplast of wheat leaves to promote infection. We sought to determine if, during STB infection, wheat also secretes small proteins into the apoplast to mediate the recognition of pathogen proteins and/or induce defense responses. To explore this, we developed an SSP-discovery pipeline to identify small, secreted proteins from wheat genomic data. Using this pipeline, we identified 6,998 SSPs, representing 2.3% of all proteins encoded by the wheat genome. We then mined a microarray dataset, detailing a resistant and susceptible host response to STB, and identified 141 Z. tritici - responsive SSPs, representing 4.7% of all proteins encoded by Z. tritici - responsive genes. We demonstrate that a subset of these SSPs have a functional signal peptide and can interact with Z. tritici SSPs. Transiently silencing two of these wheat SSPs using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) shows an increase in susceptibility to STB, confirming their role in defense against Z. tritici ."

"30120602","abstracttext","Oligopeptide transporters (OPT) are integral cell membrane proteins that play a critical role in the transport of small peptides, secondary amino acids, glutathione conjugates, and mineral uptake. In the present study, 67 putative wheat yellow stripe-like transporter (YSL) proteins belonging to the subfamily of OPT transporters were identified. Phylogeny analysis resulted in the distribution of wheat YSLs into four discrete clades. The highest number of YSLs was present on the A genome and the chromosome 2 of hexaploid wheat. The identified wheat YSL genes showed differential expression in different tissues and during grain development suggesting the importance of this subfamily. Gene expression pattern of TaYSLs during iron starvation experiments suggested an early high transcript accumulation of TaYS1A, TaYS1B, TaYSL3, TaYSL5, and TaYSL6 in roots. In contrast, delayed expression was observed in shoots for TaYS1A, TaYS1B, TaYSL5, TaYSL12, and TaYSL19 as compared to control. Further, their expression under biotic and abiotic response emphasized their alternative functions during the plant growth and development. In conclusion, this work is the first comprehensive study of wheat YSL transporters and would be an important resource for prioritizing genes towards wheat biofortification."

"29761697","abstracttext","Crops are often subjected to a combination of stresses in the field. To date, studies on the physiological and molecular responses of common wheat to a combination of osmotic and cold stresses, however, remain unknown. In this study, wheat seedlings exposed to osmotic-cold stress for 24 h showed inhibited growth, as well as increased lipid peroxidation, relative electrolyte leakage, and soluble sugar contents. iTRAQ-based quantitative proteome method was employed to determine the proteomic profiles of the roots and leaves of wheat seedlings exposed to osmotic-cold stress conditions. A total of 250 and 258 proteins with significantly altered abundance in the roots and leaves were identified, respectively, and the majority of these proteins displayed differential abundance, thereby revealing organ-specific differences in adaptation to osmotic-cold stress. Yeast two hybrid assay examined five pairs of stress/defense-related protein-protein interactions in the predicted protein interaction network. Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that abiotic stresses increased the expression of three candidate protein genes, i.e., TaGRP2, CDCP, and Wcor410c in wheat leaves. Virus-induced gene silencing indicated that three genes TaGRP2, CDCP, and Wcor410c were involved in modulating osmotic-cold stress in common wheat. Our study provides useful information for the elucidation of molecular and genetics bases of osmotic-cold combined stress in bread wheat."

Chromosome 2Vb of D. breviaristatum carries several desirable agronomic characters, including long spike length as well as enhanced resistance to stripe rust, which are expressed in a common wheat background. In this study, wheat-D. breviaristatum 2Vb deletion lines were produced and identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and 74 molecular markers specific to D. breviaristatum chromosome 2Vb were physically localized in 4 distinct chromosomal regions. New wheat-D. breviaristatum 2Vb translocation lines were also characterized by FISH. The breakpoint of the translocation T3AS.3AL-2VbS was determined by physically mapped molecular markers. Field evaluation revealed that genes affecting plant height and spike length are located on fraction length (FL) 0.65-1.00 of 2VbS, while the stripe rust resistance gene(s) are located on FL 0.40-1.00 of D. breviaristatum chromosome 2VbL.

"30678599","abstracttext","Stripe rust, a devastating disease of wheat worldwide, can be controlled by use of diverse wheat resistance resources. To find new quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to stripe rust, Qing Shumai (a Chinese winter wheat landrace possessing slow rusting resistance) was crossed with the susceptible line Mingxian 169. The parents and 276 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from the cross were evaluated in five environments involving two locations (Gansu and Shandong provinces, China) and four autumn-sown wheat seasons (2008 to 2012). Disease severities on Qing Shumai were lower than 25%, contrasting with approximately 90% on Mingxian 169. The RILs varied in rust intensity in a continuous and monomodal distribution. A bulked segregant analysis approach using 2,344 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers mapped a major QTL to the long arm of chromosome 6D (hereby designated as QYr.cau-6DL). An SSR marker (gpw5179, https://wheat.pw.usda.gov/GG2/index.shtml ) was identified as being tightly linked with QYr.cau-6DL. Combination between QYr.cau-6DL and the stripe rust-resistance gene Yr18 was examined using 160 F 2:3 families of Qing Shumai Ã RL6058 (a near-isogenic line for Yr18 in the genetic background of the spring wheat Thatcher). The combination elevated the resistance consistently across both winter and spring wheat backgrounds, acting synergistically without undesired epistasis."

"30701133","abstracttext","Undigestible, insoluble food particles, such as wheat bran, are important dietary constituents that serve as a fermentation substrate for the human gut microbiota. The first step in wheat bran fermentation involves the poorly studied solubilization of fibers from the complex insoluble wheat bran structure. Attachment of bacteria has been suggested to promote the efficient hydrolysis of insoluble substrates, but the mechanisms and drivers of this microbial attachment and colonization, as well as subsequent fermentation remain to be elucidated. We have previously shown that an individually dependent subset of gut bacteria is able to colonize the wheat bran residue. Here, we isolated these bran-attached microorganisms, which can then be used to gain mechanistic insights in future pure culture experiments. Four healthy fecal donors were screened to account for inter-individual differences in gut microbiota composition. A combination of a direct plating and enrichment method resulted in the isolation of a phylogenetically diverse set of species, belonging to the Bacteroidetes , Firmicutes , Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria phyla. A comparison with 16S rRNA gene sequences that were found enriched on wheat bran particles in previous studies, however, showed that the isolates do not yet cover the entire diversity of wheat-bran colonizing species, comprising among others a broad range of Prevotella , Bacteroides and Clostridium cluster XIVa species. We, therefore, suggest several modifications to the experiment set-up to further expand the array of isolated species."

"31172183","abstracttext","Wheat is a staple crop, frequently cultivated in water-restricted environments. Improving crop water-use efficiency would be desirable if grain yield can be maintained. We investigated whether a decrease in wheat stomatal density via the manipulation of epidermal patterning factor (EPF) gene expression could improve water-use efficiency. Our results show that severe reductions in stomatal density in EPF-overexpressing wheat plants have a detrimental outcome on yields. However, wheat plants with a more moderate reduction in stomatal density (i.e. <50% reduction in stomatal density on leaves prior to tillering) had yields indistinguishable from controls, coupled with an increase in intrinsic water-use efficiency. Yields of these moderately reduced stomatal density plants were also comparable with those of control plants under conditions of drought and elevated CO2. Our data demonstrate that EPF-mediated control of wheat stomatal development follows that observed in other grasses, and we identify the potential of stomatal density as a tool for breeding wheat plants that are better able to withstand water-restricted environments without yield loss."

Over 90% of that pairing is between homoeologous arms of wheat chromosomes, with a very strong preference for pairing between homoeologs from genomes A and D. Wheat-rye pairing was also observed at low frequency. Two mapping populations were created from the hybrids of KL with two wheat genotypes top crossed to rye. Mean chiasmata numbers per plant were used as phenotypic data. Wheat 660Â K and 15Â K SNP arrays, DArT markers and SSR markers were used for genotyping of the top-cross ABDR hybrids. One major QTL, named QPh.sicau-3A, for increased homoeologous pairing was detected on chromosome arm 3AL, and it was responsible for ca. 16% of the total variation. This QTL was located in the interval 696-725Â Mb in the Chinese Spring reference genome.

This study assessed the effect of a plant biostimulant prepared from a brown macroalga Ascophyllum nodosum (Liquid Seaweed Extract; LSE) alone and in combination with chitosan in controlling Fusarium. Wheat seedlings drenched with LSE and chitosan in combination showed reduced severity of F. graminearum infection on leaves as evidenced by a significant reduction in necrotic area and fewer number of conidia produced in the necrotic area. Gene expression studies showed that the combination of LSE and chitosan amplified the response of pathogenesis-related genes (TaPR1.1, TaPR2, TaPR3, TaGlu2) in wheat seedlings infected with Fusarium spores above that observed for the individual treatments. The combination treatments were more effective in enhancing the activity of various defense related enzymes such as peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase. FHB studies on adult plants showed a reduction of bleached spikes in wheat heads treated with the combination of LSE and chitosan. Mycotoxin content appeared to be correlated with FHB severity. Combination treatments of LSE and chitosan reduced the levels of mycotoxins deoxynivalenol and sambucinol in wheat grains. Systemic disease resistance appears to be induced by LSE and chitosan in response to F. graminearum in wheat by inducing defense genes and enzymes."

We estimate temperature impacts on yields in extensive regression models, finding that extreme heat drives wheat yield losses, with an additional 24âh of exposure to temperatures above 30âÂ°C associated with a 12.5% yield reduction. Results from a uniform warming scenario of +1âÂ°C show an average wheat yield reduction of 8.5%, which increases to 18.4% and 28.5% under +2 and +3âÂ°C scenarios. We also find evidence of differences in heat effects across cultivars, which suggests warming impacts may be reduced through the sharing of gene pools amongst wheat breeding programs."

"33106192","abstracttext","Hyperprolific sows rear more piglets than they have teats, and to accommodate this, milk replacers are often offered as a supplement. Milk replacers are based on bovine milk, yet components of vegetable origin are often added. This may reduce growth, but could also accelerate maturational changes. Therefore, we investigated the effect of feeding piglets a milk replacer with gradually increasing levels of wheat flour on growth, gut enzyme activity and immune function compared with a diet based entirely on bovine milk. The hypothesis tested was that adding a starch component (wheat flour) induces maturation of the mucosa as measured by higher digestive activity and improved integrity and immunity of the small intestines (SI). To test this hypothesis, piglets were removed from the sow at day 3 and fed either a pure milk replacer diet (MILK) or from day 11 a milk replacer diet with increasing levels of wheat (WHEAT). The WHEAT piglets had an increased enzyme activity of maltase and sucrase in the proximal part of the SI compared with the MILK group. There were no differences in gut morphology, histopathology and gene expression between the groups. In conclusion, the pigs given a milk replacer with added wheat displayed immunological and gut mucosal enzyme maturational changes, indicatory of adaptation towards a vegetable-based diet. This was not associated with any clinical complications, and future studies are needed to show whether this could improve responses in the subsequent weaning process."

The grass Brachypodium distachyon has been used previously as a model system for cereal-pathogen interactions.

Remus displaying significant differences in disease and pycnidia coverage. Using microscopy, we found that similar isolate specific responses were observed for H 2 O 2 accumulation and cell death in both wheat and B. distachyon . Despite this, induction of isolate specific patterns of defence gene expression by Z. tritici did differ between B. distachyon and wheat. Our results suggest that phenylalanine ammonia lyase ( PAL ) expression may be important for NHR in B. distachyon while pathogenesis-related ( PR ) genes and expression of genes regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) may be important to limit disease in wheat. Future studies of the B. distachyon - Z. tritici interaction may allow identification of conserved plant immunity targets which are responsible for the isolate specific responses observed in both plant species."

To facilitate gene discovery, we assembled an association mapping panel of 528 spring wheat landraces of diverse geographic origin for a genome-wide association study (GWAS). All accessions were genotyped using an Illumina Infinium 9K wheat single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip and 4781 polymorphic SNPs were used for analysis. To identify loci underlying resistance to the major leaf spot diseases and to better understand the genomic patterns, we quantified population structure, allelic diversity, and linkage disequilibrium. Our results showed 32 loci were significantly associated with resistance to the major leaf spot diseases. Further analysis identified QTL effective against major leaf spot diseases of wheat which appeared to be novel and others that were previously identified by association analysis using Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) and bi-parental mapping. In addition, several identified SNPs co-localized with genes that have been implicated in plant disease resistance. Future work could aim to select the putative novel loci and pyramid them in locally adapted wheat cultivars to develop broad-spectrum resistance to multiple leaf spot diseases of wheat via marker-assisted selection (MAS)."

"18193186","abstracttext","A better understanding of the genetic factors controlling grain yellow pigment content (GYPC) is important for both pasta (high GYPC) and bread wheat (low GYPC) quality improvement. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for GYPC have been mapped repeatedly on the distal regions of chromosome arms 7AL and 7BL in wheat, and the Phytoene synthase 1 (PSY-1) gene located in this region has been proposed as a candidate gene. We show here that PSY-E1, the tall wheatgrass orthologue, is completely linked to differences in GYPC, and that selection for white endosperm mutants in recombinant lines carrying this gene resulted in the identification of a mutation in a conserved amino acid of PSY-E1. These results, together with the association between GYPC and allelic differences in PSY-1 in hexaploid wheat, suggest that this gene plays an important role in the determination of GYPC. However, a second white endosperm mutant previously mapped to chromosome arm 7EL showed no mutations in PSY-E1 suggesting the existence of additional gene(s) affecting GYPC in this chromosome region. This hypothesis was further supported by the mapping of QTL for GYPC on 7AL proximal to PSY-1 in a cross between pasta wheat varieties UC1113 and Kofa. Interestingly, the Kofa PSY-B1 allele showed unusually high levels of polymorphisms as a result of a conversion event involving the PSY-A1 allele. In summary, our results support the hypothesis that allelic differences in PSY-1 and at least one additional gene in the distal region of the long arm of homoeologous group 7L are associated with differences in GYPC."

The proteins encoded by genes of the TaHKT2;2 family revealed more than 93% amino acid sequence identity but â¤52% amino acid identity compared to the proteins encoded by TaHKT2;1 family. Specifically, variations in known critical domains predicted functional differences between the two protein families. Similar to orthologous rice genes on chromosome 6L, TaHKT2;1 and TaHKT2;2 genes were located approximately 3 kb apart on wheat chromosomes 7AL, 7BL and 7DL, forming a static syntenic block in the two species.

"26934890","abstracttext_key message","Gene PmAF7DS confers resistance to wheat powdery mildew (isolate Bgt#211 ); it was mapped to a 14.6-cM interval ( Xgwm350 a- Xbarc184 ) on chromosome 7DS. The flanking markers could be applied in MAS breeding. Wheat powdery mildew (Pm) is caused by the biotrophic pathogen Blumeria graminis tritici (DC.) (Bgt). An ongoing threat of breakdown of race-specific resistance to Pm requires a continuous effort to discover new alleles in the wheat gene pool. Developing new cultivars with improved disease resistance is an economically and environmentally safe approach to reduce yield losses. To identify and characterize genes for resistance against Pm in bread wheat we used the (ArinaÂ ÃÂ Forno) RILs population. Initially, the two parental lines were screened with a collection of 61 isolates of Bgt from Israel. Three Pm isolates Bgt#210 , Bgt#211 and Bgt#213 showed differential reactions in the parents: Arina was resistant (ITÂ =Â 0), whereas Forno was moderately susceptible (ITÂ =Â -3). Isolate Bgt#211 was then used to inoculate the RIL population. The segregation pattern of plant reactions among the RILs indicates that a single dominant gene controls the conferred resistance. A genetic map of the region containing this gene was assembled with DNA markers and assigned to the 7D physical bin map. The gene, temporarily designated PmAF7DS, was located in the distal region of chromosome arm 7DS. The RILs were also inoculated with Bgt#210 and Bgt#213. The plant reactions to these isolates showed high identity with the reaction to Bgt#211, indicating the involvement of the same gene or closely linked, but distinct single genes. The genomic location of PmAF7DS, in light of other Pm genes on 7DS is discussed."
"28293708","articletitle","Inverse gene-for-gene interactions contribute additively to tan spot susceptibility in wheat."
"28293708","abstracttext_key message","Tan spot susceptibility is conferred by multiple interactions of necrotrophic effector and host sensitivity genes. Tan spot of wheat, caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, is an important disease in almost all wheat-growing areas of the world. The disease system is known to involve at least three fungal-produced necrotrophic effectors (NEs) that interact with the corresponding host sensitivity (S) genes in an inverse gene-for-gene manner to induce disease. However, it is unknown if the effects of these NE-S gene interactions contribute additively to the development of tan spot. In this work, we conducted disease evaluations using different races and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis in a wheat recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between two susceptible genotypes, LMPG-6 and PI 626573. The two parental lines each harbored a single known NE sensitivity gene with LMPG-6 having the Ptr ToxC sensitivity gene Tsc1 and PI 626573 having the Ptr ToxA sensitivity gene Tsn1. Transgressive segregation was observed in the population for all races. QTL mapping revealed that both loci (Tsn1 and Tsc1) were significantly associated with susceptibility to race 1 isolates, which produce both Ptr ToxA and Ptr ToxC, and the two genes contributed additively to tan spot susceptibility. For isolates of races 2 and 3, which produce only Ptr ToxA and Ptr ToxC, only Tsn1 and Tsc1 were associated with tan spot susceptibility, respectively. This work clearly demonstrates that tan spot susceptibility in this population is due primarily to two NE-S interactions. Breeders should remove both sensitivity genes from wheat lines to obtain high levels of tan spot resistance."

"30064355","abstracttext_background","The Hessian fly response genes, Hfr-1 and Hfr-2, have been reported to be significantly induced in a Hessian fly attack. Nothing is known about the allelic variants of these two genes in susceptible (S) and resistant (R) wheat cultivars."
"30064355","abstracttext_results","Basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) analysis of Hessian fly response genes have identified three alleles of Hessian fly response gene 1 (Hfr-1) on chromosome 4AL and 7DS, and 10 alleles of Hessian fly response gene 2 (Hfr-2) on chromosome 2BS, 2DL, 4BS, 4BL, 5AL and 5BL. Resequencing exons of Hfr-1 and Hfr-2 have identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the lectin domain of each gene that segregates some R sources from S cultivars. Two SNP assays have been developed. The SNP883_Hfr-1 assay characterizes a 'G/A' SNP in Hfr-1, which differentiates 14 Hessian fly R cultivars from S ones. The SNP1294_Hfr-2 assay differentiates 12 R cultivars from S ones. Each of the two SNPs identified in Hfr-1 and Hfr-2 is 'G/A' and resulted in an amino acid change from isoleucine to valine in the lectin domain of the proteins of the alleles in the R cultivars. In addition to the genotype profiles of Hfr-1 and Hfr-2, generated for a set of 249 wheat cultivars which included a set of 39 R cultivars, this study has genotyped the Hessian fly response gene, HfrDrd, and the H32 gene for the wheat germplasm. Resistant cultivars from different origins with one, two, three or four resistance (R) genes in various combinations/permutations have been identified."
"30064355","abstracttext_conclusion","This study has identified allelic differences in two Hessian fly response genes, Hfr-1 and Hfr-2, between S and R cultivars and developed one SNP assay for each of the genes. These two SNP assays for Hfr-1 and Hfr-2, together with the published assays for HfrDrd and the H32 gene, can be used for the selection and incorporation of one or more of these 4 R genes identified in the different R sources in wheat breeding programs."

"31370780","abstracttext_background","Free asparagine is the precursor for acrylamide formation during cooking and processing of grains, tubers, beans and other crop products. In wheat grain, free asparagine, free glutamine and total free amino acids accumulate to high levels in response to sulphur deficiency. In this study, RNA-seq data were acquired for the embryo and endosperm of two genotypes of bread wheat, Spark and SR3, growing under conditions of sulphur sufficiency and deficiency, and sampled at 14 and 21âdays post anthesis (dpa). The aim was to provide new knowledge and understanding of the genetic control of asparagine accumulation and breakdown in wheat grain."
"31370780","abstracttext_results","There were clear differences in gene expression patterns between the genotypes. Sulphur responses were greater at 21 dpa than 14 dpa, and more evident in SR3 than Spark. TaASN2 was the most highly expressed asparagine synthetase gene in the grain, with expression in the embryo much higher than in the endosperm, and higher in Spark than SR3 during early development. There was a trend for genes encoding enzymes of nitrogen assimilation to be more highly expressed in Spark than SR3 when sulphur was supplied. TaASN2 expression in the embryo of SR3 increased in response to sulphur deficiency at 21 dpa, although this was not observed in Spark. This increase in TaASN2 expression was accompanied by an increase in glutamine synthetase gene expression and a decrease in asparaginase gene expression. Asparagine synthetase and asparaginase gene expression in the endosperm responded in the opposite way. Genes encoding regulatory protein kinases, SnRK1 and GCN2, both implicated in regulating asparagine synthetase gene expression, also responded to sulphur deficiency. Genes encoding bZIP transcription factors, including Opaque2/bZIP9, SPA/bZIP25 and BLZ1/OHP1/bZIP63, all of which contain SnRK1 target sites, were also expressed. Homeologues of many genes showed differential expression patterns and responses, including TaASN2."
"31370780","abstracttext_conclusions","Data on the genetic control of free asparagine accumulation in wheat grain and its response to sulphur supply showed grain asparagine levels to be determined in the embryo, and identified genes encoding signalling and metabolic proteins involved in asparagine metabolism that respond to sulphur availability."

"2359493","abstracttext","An antiserum raised against the C-terminal region of rat alpha-calcitonin gene-related peptide has been used to investigate the morphology and topographical distribution of neurons and terminals containing calcitonin gene-related peptide in the cat dorsal column nuclear complex. Calcitonin gene-related peptide-positive fibers and axon terminals were denser in the cuneate nucleus than in the other dorsal column nuclei subdivisions and were observed throughout all rostrocaudal levels. They were densest in the dorsal and ventrolateral portions of the middle cuneate. Immunoreactive neurons were observed only in animals pre-treated with colchicine. In these cases, some calcitonin gene-related peptide-positive neurons were present in the cuneate and in the external cuneate. In double-labeling experiments, visualization of calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactivity in dorsal root ganglia neurons was combined with the retrograde transport of colloidal gold-labeled wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to inactive horseradish peroxidase injected in the cuneate nucleus. These experiments show that calcitonin gene-related peptide-positive fibers in the cuneate nucleus originate mostly from C3-C6 medium sized dorsal root ganglia neurons but also from some small and large neurons. These results suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide-positive fibers may convey sensory information from a wide range of peripheral receptors."

"6354467","abstracttext","The mitochondrial genome of maize contains a DNA sequence homologous to the chloroplast gene coding for the large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (LS gene). The presence in mitochondrial DNA of both coding and flanking sequences of this gene has been demonstrated first, by cross hybridization between the purified organelle DNAs and between cloned mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA sequences and second, by in vitro transcription-translation of cloned mitochondrial DNA in an E. coli cell free system where a 21,000 dalton polypeptide is synthesized that can be precipitated with antibodies to wheat ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase. In contrast to the 12 kb chloroplast homologous sequence found in the mitochondrial genome (Stern and Lonsdale, 1982), the sequence homologous to the LS gene is unaltered in mitochondrial DNA isolated from the male sterile cytoplasms of maize. The LS gene homologous sequence in the mitochondrial genome is located some 65 kb from the 18S mitochondrial rRNA gene and approximately 20 kb from the mitochondrial DNA sequence having homology to the chloroplast 16S rRNA gene."

"8890515","abstracttext","The aim of this study was to find molecular markers (RAPD and SCAR) for the wheat leaf rust resistance gene Lr24. A backcross line, RL 6064, possessing a single resistance gene to leaf rust (Lr24) and its recurrent parent 'Thatcher' were used to find RAPD markers linked to the Lr24 gene. Among 125 RAPD primers tested, only one (OP-H5) detected an additional band in the resistant line RL 6064. The genetic linkage of this molecular marker to Lr24 was tested on a segregating F2 population derived from a cross between the leaf rust resistant line RL 6064 and the susceptible line 'Chinese Spring'. This marker showed complete linkage to the Lr24 resistance gene. A more reliable and specific marker for this resistance gene was made by converting it into a sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR). The presence of a single amplification product allowed direct detection of the gene in the test tube by the addition of ethidium bromide. This SCAR marker linked to the leaf rust resistance gene Lr24 could be used easily in a practical breeding program."

"10655233","abstracttext","Physical mapping of wheat chromosomes has revealed small chromosome segments of high gene density and frequent recombination interspersed with relatively large regions of low gene density and infrequent recombination. We constructed a detailed genetic and physical map of one highly recombinant region on the long arm of chromosome 5B. This distally located region accounts for 4% of the physical size of the long arm and at least 30% of the recombination along the entire chromosome. Multiple crossovers occurred within this region, and the degree of recombination is at least 11-fold greater than the genomic average. Characteristics of the region such as gene order and frequency of recombination appear to be conserved throughout the evolution of the Triticeae. The region is more prone to chromosome breakage by gametocidal gene action than gene-poor regions, and evidence for genomic instability was implied by loss of gene collinearity for six loci among the homeologous regions. These data suggest that a unique level of chromatin organization exists within gene-rich recombination hot spots. The many agronomically important genes in this region should be accessible by positional cloning."

"20150979","abstracttext","In order to efficiently utilize natural cellulose materials to produce ethylene, three expression vectors containing the ethylene-forming enzyme (efe) gene from Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea were constructed. The target gene was respectively controlled by different promoters: cbh I promoter from Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolases I gene, gpd promoter from Aspergillus nidulans glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene and pgk I promoter from T. reesei 3-phosphoglycerate kinase I gene. After transforming into T. reesei QM9414, 43 stable transformants were obtained by PCR amplification and ethylene determination. Southern blot analysis of 14 transformants demonstrated that the efe gene was integrated into chromosomal DNA with copy numbers from 1 to 4. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of 6 transformants showed that the heterologous gene was transcribed. By using wheat straw as a carbon source, the ethylene production rates of aforementioned 14 transformants were measured. Transformant C30-3 with pgk I promoter had the highest ethylene production (4,012 nl h(-1) l(-1)). This indicates that agricultural wastes could be used to produce ethylene in recombinant filamentous fungus T. reesei."

"19766013","abstracttext","A SiPf40 gene was identified from an immature seed cDNA library of foxtail millet (Setaria italica). This gene encodes for a 29.4 KDa protein containing eight potential transmembrane domains and a highly conserved ZIP signature motif typical of ZIPs (zinc or iron transporter proteins) family. Other SiPf40 potential homologous genes have also been identified in rice, maize, wheat and Arabidopsis by Southern analysis. Expression data showed that this gene is preferentially expressed in millet hypocotyl and bud; however, a minimal level of constitutive expression could be detected in other foxtail millet tissues. Overexpression of SiPf40 gene causes extra branches in tobacco and extra tillering in millet associated with vessel enlarging and xylary fibers increasing, whereas the tiller number decreases in SiPf40 gene silenced plants. Moreover, IAA content decreased significantly in shoot apex of the transgenic tobacco overexpressing SiPf40 gene. All together, these morphological alterations indicate that SiPf40 gene is essential for lateral shoots growth."

"21356000","abstracttext","A high-throughput RNA-mediated gene silencing system was developed for Cochliobolus sativus (anamorph: Bipolaris sorokiniana), the causal agent of spot blotch, common root rot and black point in barley and wheat. The green fluorescent protein gene (GFP) and the proteinaceous host-selective toxin gene (ToxA) were first introduced into C. sativus via the polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated transformation method. Transformants with a high level of expression of GFP or ToxA were generated. A silencing vector (pSGate1) based on the Gateway cloning system was developed and used to construct RNA interference (RNAi) vectors. Silencing of GFP and ToxA in the transformants was demonstrated by transformation with the RNAi construct expressing hairpin RNA (hpRNA) of the target gene. The polyketide synthase gene (CsPKS1), involved in melanin biosynthesis pathways in C. sativus, was also targeted by transformation with the RNAi vector (pSGate1-CsPKS1) encoding hpRNA of the CsPKS1 gene. The transformants with pSGate1-CsPKS1 exhibited an albino phenotype or reduced melanization, suggesting effective silencing of the endogenous CsPKS1 in C. sativus. Sectors exhibiting the wild-type phenotype of the fungus appeared in some of the CsPKS1-silenced transformants after subcultures as a result of inactivation or deletions of the RNAi transgene. The gene silencing system established provides a useful tool for functional genomics studies in C. sativus and other filamentous fungi."

"31195255","abstracttext","The homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) gene family plays an important role in plant growth and environmental responses. At present, research on the HD-Zip gene family of barley is incomplete. In this study, 32 HD-Zip genes (HvHD-Zip 1-32) were identified from the barley genome and were subsequently divided into four subfamilies according to conserved structure and motif analysis. Whole genome replication events in barley and Arabidopsis, rice, and wheat HD-Zip gene families were analyzed, yielding 3, 14 and 25 gene pairs, respectively, but no segmental or tandem duplication events were identified in the barley HD-Zip gene family. Subsequently, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that the HvHD-Zip gene is sensitive to drought stress and that members of the HD-Zip I and HD-Zip IV subfamilies are generally more sensitive to abiotic stresses. Our results suggest a relationship between barley resistance and the potential key HvHD-Zip gene, which lay the foundation for further functional studies."
"1170802","articletitle","The pathogenesis of gluten-sensitive enteropathy."
"1170802","abstracttext","Gluten-sensitive enteropathy is characterized by flattening of intestinal villi and malabsorption caused by the toxic effect of gluten, a wheat protein. Gluten activates an endogenous mechanism of toxicity that may be the local mucosal immune system: local mucosal immunoglobulin and antigluten antibody production occur soon after gluten ingestion. Approximately 80% of patients with this disease possess HL-A8, a second segregant series antigen. This association also occurs in dermatitis herpetiformis, a disease with vesicular skin lesions and gluten-sensitive flattening of intestinal villi. The association suggests that the fundamental abnormality in enteropathy is a binding reaction involving gluten protein and a binding site on a cell surface, determined in part by the histocompatibility gene; this reaction then results in a local mucosal immune response to gluten. Alternatively, the fundamental abnormality may be the presence of an abnormal immune-response gene linked to the HL-A8 gene or acting in concert with it; this immune-response gene results in local mucosal production of antigluten antibody."

"3442826","abstracttext","The gene for pre-apocytochrome f has been mapped by blot hybridization on a 2.4 kbp HindIII fragment of the circular plastid chromosome of Oenothera hookeri employing probes from the corresponding spinach gene. The gene is located distal to the gene for the ATP synthase subunit alpha, at the border of the 45 kbp inversion that distinguishes spinach and Oenothera plastid chromosomes. Both genes are transcribed in the same direction. Nucleotide sequence analysis reveals a single open reading frame encoding 318 amino acids of which 285 comprise the mature polypeptide and another 33 residues represent probably a N-terminal signal sequence. The putative pre-sequence is 2 residues shorter than those known from the spinach, wheat and pea protein. The deduced amino acid sequences of f cytochromes from the four plant species show over 80% conservation, maintaining the structural characteristics of the protein."

To examine the cpDNA sequence variation in rice, cpDNA from Labelle and its parents, Belle Patna and Dawn was compared. Using the cytochrome f gene as the probe for hybridization, we found several differences in the size and number of restriction fragments in the cp genome of three rice varieties. An additional restriction fragment found in the Belle Patna cp suggests that this cp genome is either heterogeneous or contains two copies of cytochrome f gene per cpDNA."
"3315648","articletitle","The 5'-proximal region of the wheat Cab-1 gene contains a 268-bp enhancer-like sequence for phytochrome response."
"3315648","abstracttext","We have previously reported that the expression of the wheat Cab-1 gene is subject to phytochrome regulation and a 1.8-kb 5' upstream sequence of this gene is sufficient for the regulated expression. To delineate sequences for the phytochrome response we analyzed a series of 5' deletion mutants as well as chimeric gene constructs comprising different sequences of the Cab-1 upstream region in transgenic tobacco seedlings. We found that a deletion mutant containing a 357-bp 5' upstream sequence still exhibits maximal levels of phytochrome-regulated expression. A 268-bp enhancer-like element, located between -89 and -357, is responsible for the phytochrome response of the Cab-1 gene; sequences upstream from -357 to -843 and downstream from -124 to +1100 are probably not involved. Finally, we show that the Cab-1 mRNA stability is not regulated by phytochrome."

"9211793","abstracttext","Northern analyses and reverse transcription-polymerase chain-reaction (RT-PCR) experiments, followed by PCR amplification product sequencing, were performed on total mitochondrial (mt) RNAs from wheat seedlings and tissue cultures. It was shown that the rps13 gene, which encodes ribosomal protein S13, and the atp6 gene, which encodes subunit 6 of the ATP synthase complex, were co-transcribed. However, rps13 transcripts were virtually undetectable in seedlings under conditions where atp6 transcripts appeared abundant. In addition, markedly higher steady state transcript levels were observed in tissue culture. Expression of the mitochondrial rps13 gene was confirmed by showing that its transcripts were edited. Slight differences between editing patterns of tissue-culture and whole-plant transcripts were found. Taken together, these results suggest that in vitro culture could disturb the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression."

"8628212","abstracttext","Several variants of the replacement histone H3 genes from soybean, barley and wheat have been cloned and sequenced. Analysis of segregating populations in barley and soybean, as well as analysis of clones isolated from a soybean genomic library, suggested that these genes are dispersed throughout the genome. Several genes contains introns located in similar positions, but of different lengths and sequence. Comparison of mRNA levels in different tissues revealed that the intron-containing and intronless genes have different expression patterns. The distribution of the introns in the histone H3 genes across several plant species suggests that some of the introns might have been lost during the evolution of the gene family. Sequence divergence among introns and gene-flanking sequences in cloned gene variants allowed us to use them as specific probes for localizing individual gene copies and analyzing the genomic distribution of these variants across a range of genotypes."

Gns7 and Gns8, together with the barley genes GVI and Hv34, represent Subfamily C. Gns9 and a beta-glucanase gene from wheat were grouped in Subfamily D. Genes in Subfamilies C and D have structures that are distinct from those of the other subfamilies, but there are very little data available on the biochemical or physiological roles of these genes. Gene expression in growing tissues and lack of gene induction in response to disease-related treatments suggest that Subfamilies C and D may function in control of plant growth."
"10838615","articletitle","Colinearity and gene density in grass genomes."
"10838615","abstracttext","Grasses are the single most important plant family in agriculture. In the past years, comparative genetic mapping has revealed conserved gene order (colinearity) among many grass species. Recently, the first studies at gene level have demonstrated that microcolinearity of genes is less conserved: small scale rearrangements and deletions complicate the microcolinearity between closely related species, such as sorghum and maize, but also between rice and other crop plants. In spite of these problems, rice remains the model plant for grasses as there is limited useful colinearity between Arabidopsis and grasses. However, studies in rice have to be complemented by more intensive genetic work on grass species with large genomes (maize, Triticeae). Gene-rich chromosomal regions in species with large genomes, such as wheat, have a high gene density and are ideal targets for partial genome sequencing."

Southern blot analysis showed that the OMT gene was a single copy in both salt-tolerant and -sensitive barley. The cloned gene was expressed in a wheat germ cell-free system to produce the OMT, which had methylating activity for caffeic acid. Northern blot analysis showed that the OMT gene was expressed constitutively in the salt-tolerant barley roots and the expression level was increased 1.5 times by salt stress, but the salt-sensitive barley showed no expression of the gene in roots and leaves."

"19880637","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is a fungal pathogen of cereal crops (e.g., wheat, barley, maize) and produces a number of mycotoxins, including 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol, butenolide, zearalenone, and culmorin. To identify a biosynthetic gene for the culmorin pathway, an expressed-sequence-tag database was examined for terpene cyclase genes. A gene designated CLM1 was expressed under trichothecene-inducing conditions. Expression of CLM1 in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) resulted in the production of a sesquiterpene alcohol, longiborneol, which has the same ring structure as culmorin. Gene disruption and add-back experiments in F. graminearum showed that CLM1 was required for culmorin biosynthesis. CLM1 gene disruptants were able to convert exogenously added longiborneol to culmorin. Longiborneol accumulated transiently in culmorin-producing strains. The results indicate that CLM1 encodes a longiborneol synthase and is required for culmorin biosynthesis in F. graminearum."

Out of eighteen OTUs identified from mcrA gene library, fifteen clustered with order Methanobacteriales, two resemble with Methanomicrobiales and remaining one grouped with Methanosarcinales. These results revealed that Methanobrevibacter phylotype was predominantly present in Karan Fries crossbred cattle fed on high fibrous diet containing wheat straw.

"25765928","abstracttext","Polyploidy or whole-genome duplication occurs in some animals and many flowering plants, including many important crops such as wheat, cotton and oilseed rape. The prevalence of polyploidy in the plant kingdom suggests it as an important evolutionary feature for plant speciation and crop domestication. Studies of natural and synthetic polyploids have revealed rapid and dynamic changes in genomic structure and gene expression after polyploid formation. Growing evidence suggests that epigenetic modifications can alter homoeologous gene expression and reprogram gene expression networks, which allows polyploids to establish new cytotypes, grow vigorously and promote adaptation in local environments. Sequence and gene expression changes in polyploids have been well documented and reviewed elsewhere. This review is focused on developmental regulation and epigenetic changes including DNA methylation and histone modifications in polyploids."

"26758725","abstracttext_results","A series of plasmids with an SfiI site between the selection marker and the replication origin were constructed. The three wheat eEF1B subunit genes inserted between the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET-22b were transferred to the SfiI-containing plasmid with a spectinomycin-resistance gene. Then, the marker gene in the resultant plasmids was substituted with the ampicillin-resistance gene.

"30828275","abstracttext","Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici is a soil borne pathogenic fungus associated with wheat roots. The accurate quantification of gene expression during the process of infection might be helpful to understand the pathogenic molecular mechanism. However, this method requires suitable reference genes for transcript normalization. In this study, nine candidate reference genes were chosen, and the specificity of the primers were investigated by melting curves of PCR products. The expression stability of these nine candidates was determined with three programs-geNorm, Norm Finder, and Best Keeper. TUBÎ² was identified as the most stable reference gene. Furthermore, the exopolygalacturonase gene ( ExoPG ) was selected to verify the reliability of TUBÎ² expression. The expression profile of ExoPG assessed using TUBÎ² agreed with the results of digital gene expression analysis by RNA-Seq. This study is the first systematic exploration of the optimal reference genes in the infection process of Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici ."

"15833661","abstracttext","Drought is one of the major factors limiting crop production globally, with increasing global climate change making the situation more serious. Wheat is the staple food for more than 35% of world population, so wheat anti-drought physiology study is of importance to wheat production and biological breeding for the sake of coping with abiotic and biotic conditions. Much research is involved in this hot topic, but the pace of progress is not so large because of drought resistance being a multiple-gene-control quantitative character and wheat genome being larger (16,000 Mb). On the other hand, stress adaptive mechanisms are quite different, with stress degree, time course, materials, and experimental plots, thus increasing the complexity of the issue in question. Additionally, a little study is related to the whole life circle of wheat, which cannot provide a comprehensive understanding of its anti-drought machinery. We selected 10 kinds of wheat genotypes as materials, which have potential to be applied in practice, and measured relative change of anti-oxidative enzymes and membrane peroxidation through wheat whole growth-developmental circle (i.e. seedling, tillering and maturing). Here, we firstly reported the results of seedling stage as follows: (1) 10 wheat genotypes can be grouped into three kinds (A-C, respectively) according to their changing trend of the measured indices; (2) A performed better resistance drought under the condition of treatment level 1 (appropriate level), whose activities of anti-oxidative enzymes (POD, SOD, CAT) were higher and MDA lower and chlorophyll a+b higher; (3) B exhibited stronger anti-drought under treatment level 2 (light stress level), whose activities of anti-oxidative enzymes were higher, MDA lower and chlorophyll higher; (4) C expressed anti-drought to some extent under treatment level 3 (serious stress), whose activities of anti-oxidative enzymes were stronger, MDA lower and chlorophyll higher; (5) these results demonstrated that different wheat genotypes have different physiological mechanisms to adapt themselves to changing drought stress, whose molecular basis is discrete gene expression profiling (transcriptom); (6) our results also showed that the concept accepted by most researchers, 70-75% QF is a proper supply for plants, was doubted, because this level could not reflect the true suitable level of wheat. The study in this respect is the key to wheat anti-drought and biological saving-water; (7) our research can provide insights into physiological mechanisms of crop anti-drought and direct practical materials for wheat anti-drought breeding."
"21104373","articletitle","Evaluation of Pakistan wheat germplasms for stripe rust resistance using molecular markers."
"21104373","abstracttext","Wheat production in Pakistan is seriously constrained due to rust diseases and stripe rust (yellow) caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, which could limit yields. Thus development and cultivation of genetically diverse and resistant varieties is the most sustainable solution to overcome these diseases. The first objective of the present study was to evaluate 100 Pakistan wheat cultivars that have been grown over the past 60 years. These cultivars were inoculated at the seedling stage with two virulent stripe rust isolates from the United States and two from Pakistan. None of the wheat cultivars were resistant to all tested stripe rust isolates, and 16% of cultivars were susceptible to the four isolates at the seedling stage. The data indicated that none of the Pakistan wheat cultivars contained either Yr5 or Yr15 genes that were considered to be effective against most P. striiformis f. sp. tritici isolates from around the world. Several Pakistan wheat cultivars may have gene Yr10, which is effective against isolate PST-127 but ineffective against PST-116. It is also possible that these cultivars may have other previously unidentified genes or gene combinations. The second objective was to evaluate the 100 Pakistan wheat cultivars for stripe rust resistance during natural epidemics in Pakistan and Washington State, USA. It was found that a higher frequency of resistance was present under field conditions compared with greenhouse conditions. Thirty genotypes (30% of germplasms) were found to have a potentially high temperature adult plant (HTAP) resistance. The third objective was to determine the genetic diversity in Pakistan wheat germplasms using molecular markers. This study was based on DNA fingerprinting using resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) marker analysis. The highest polymorphism detected with RGAP primer pairs was 40%, 50% and 57% with a mean polymorphism of 36%. A total of 22 RGAP markers were obtained in this study. RGAP, simple sequence repeat (SSR) and sequence tagged site (STS) markers were used to determine the presence and absence of some important stripe rust resistance genes, such as Yr5, Yr8, Yr9, Yr15 and Yr18. Of the 60 cultivars analyzed, 17% of cultivars showed a RGAP marker band for Yr9 and 12% of cultivars exhibited the Yr18 marker band. No marker band was detected for Yr5, Yr8 and Yr15, indicating a likely absence of these genes in the tested Pakistan wheat cultivars. Cluster analysis based on molecular and stripe rust reaction data is useful in identifying considerable genetic diversity among Pakistan wheat cultivars. The resistant germplasms identified with 22 RGAP markers and from the resistance evaluations should be useful in developing new wheat cultivars with stripe rust resistance."

"8162318","abstracttext","A number of wheat-Elymus trachycaulus (2n = 4x = 28, genomically StStHtHt) chromosome addition, substitution, and translocation lines were isolated from the derivatives of an E. trachycaulus x wheat hybrid. Eighteen out of a total of 28 chromosome arms of E. trachycaulus were recovered in the addition lines. The genomic affinity of individual E. trachycaulus chromosomes was analysed by comparative chromosome banding and in situ hybridization using genome-specific repetitive DNA sequences as probes. The homoeology of the E. trachycaulus chromosomes added to wheat was determined by storage protein, isozyme, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Alloplasmic wheat-E. trachycaulus chromosome additions were isolated which only involved chromosome 1Ht and 1St that carry fertility restoration gene Rf-Ht1 and Rf-St1, respectively. Based on the results of production and characterization of a wheat-E. trachycaulus 5Ht(5B) substitution line, it is likely that some wheat chromosomes can be well compensated genetically by E. trachycaulus chromosomes. Several spontaneous wheat-E. trachycaulus chromosome translocation lines were detected. All the translocation lines involved either 1Ht or 1St. To estimate the potential of recombination between wheat and E. trachycaulus chromosomes, a backcross population derived from a plant which was double monosomic for chromosomes 7A and 7AL.7AS-1StS and a ph1b gene was developed. The plants from this population were analysed for 1St-specific genetic markers and no recombinant was recovered."
"15690172","articletitle","Large deletions within the first intron in VRN-1 are associated with spring growth habit in barley and wheat."
"15690172","abstracttext","The broad adaptability of wheat and barley is in part attributable to their flexible growth habit, in that spring forms have recurrently evolved from the ancestral winter growth habit. In diploid wheat and barley growth habit is determined by allelic variation at the VRN-1 and/or VRN-2 loci, whereas in the polyploid wheat species it is determined primarily by allelic variation at VRN-1. Dominant Vrn-A1 alleles for spring growth habit are frequently associated with mutations in the promoter region in diploid wheat and in the A genome of common wheat. However, several dominant Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1, Vrn-D1 (common wheat) and Vrn-H1 (barley) alleles show no polymorphisms in the promoter region relative to their respective recessive alleles. In this study, we sequenced the complete VRN-1 gene from these accessions and found that all of them have large deletions within the first intron, which overlap in a 4-kb region. Furthermore, a 2.8-kb segment within the 4-kb region showed high sequence conservation among the different recessive alleles. PCR markers for these deletions showed that similar deletions were present in all the accessions with known Vrn-B1 and Vrn-D1 alleles, and in 51 hexaploid spring wheat accessions previously shown to have no polymorphisms in the VRN-A1 promoter region. Twenty-four tetraploid wheat accessions had a similar deletion in VRN-A1 intron 1. We hypothesize that the 2.8-kb conserved region includes regulatory elements important for the vernalization requirement. Epistatic interactions between VRN-H2 and the VRN-H1 allele with the intron 1 deletion suggest that the deleted region may include a recognition site for the flowering repression mediated by the product of the VRN-H2 gene of barley."

"18943932","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Fusarium graminearum causes Fusarium head blight (FHB) in small grains worldwide. Although primarily a pathogen of cereals, it also can infect noncereal crops such as potato and sugar beet in the United States. We used a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method based on intergenic sequences specific to the trichodiene synthase gene (Tri5) from F. graminearum. TaqMan probe and primers were designed and used to estimate DNA content of the pathogen (FgDNA) in the susceptible wheat cv. Grandin after inoculation with the 21 isolates of F. graminearum collected from potato, sugar beet, and wheat. The presence of nine mycotoxins was analyzed in the inoculated wheat heads by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. All isolates contained the Tri5 gene and were virulent to cv. Grandin. Isolates of F. graminearum differed significantly in virulence (expressed as disease severity), FgDNA content, and mycotoxin accumulation. Potato isolates showed greater variability in producing different mycotoxins than sugar beet and wheat isolates. Correlation analysis showed a significant (P < 0.001) positive relationship between FgDNA content and FHB severity or deoxynivalenol (DON) production. Moreover, a significant (P < 0.001) positive correlation between FHB severity and DON content was observed. Our findings revealed that F. graminearum causing potato dry rot and sugar beet decay could be potential sources of inoculum for FHB epidemics in wheat. Real-time PCR assay provides sensitive and accurate quantification of F. graminearum in wheat and can be useful for monitoring the colonization of wheat grains by F. graminearum in controlled environments, and evaluating wheat germplasms for resistance to FHB."

"20920368","abstracttext_background","Phosphomannomutase (PMM) is an essential enzyme in eukaryotes. However, little is known about PMM gene and function in crop plants. Here, we report molecular evolutionary and biochemical analysis of PMM genes in bread wheat and related Triticeae species."
"20920368","abstracttext_results","Two sets of homologous PMM genes (TaPMM-1 and 2) were found in bread wheat, and two corresponding PMM genes were identified in the diploid progenitors of bread wheat and many other diploid Triticeae species. The duplication event yielding PMM-1 and 2 occurred before the radiation of diploid Triticeae genomes. The PMM gene family in wheat and relatives may evolve largely under purifying selection. Among the six TaPMM genes, the transcript levels of PMM-1 members were comparatively high and their recombinant proteins were all enzymatically active. However, PMM-2 homologs exhibited lower transcript levels, two of which were also inactive. TaPMM-A1, B1 and D1 were probably the main active isozymes in bread wheat tissues. The three isozymes differed from their counterparts in barley and Brachypodium distachyon in being more tolerant to elevated test temperatures."

"23887654","articletitle","Identification and phylogenetic analysis of a CC-NBS-LRR encoding gene assigned on chromosome 7B of wheat."
"23887654","abstracttext","Hexaploid wheat displays limited genetic variation. As a direct A and B genome donor of hexaploid wheat, tetraploid wheat represents an important gene pool for cultivated bread wheat. Many disease resistant genes express conserved domains of the nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeats (NBS-LRR). In this study, we isolated a CC-NBS-LRR gene locating on chromosome 7B from durum wheat variety Italy 363, and designated it TdRGA-7Ba. Its open reading frame was 4014 bp, encoding a 1337 amino acid protein with a complete NBS domain and 18 LRR repeats, sharing 44.7% identity with the PM3B protein. TdRGA-7Ba expression was continuously seen at low levels and was highest in leaves. TdRGA-7Ba has another allele TdRGA-7Bb with a 4 bp deletion at position +1892 in other cultivars of tetraploid wheat. In Ae. speltoides, as a B genome progenitor, both TdRGA-7Ba and TdRGA-7Bb were detected. In all six species of hexaploid wheats (AABBDD), only TdRGA-7Bb existed. Phylogenic analysis showed that all TdRGA-7Bb type genes were grouped in one sub-branch. We speculate that TdRGA-7Bb was derived from a TdRGA-7Ba mutation, and it happened in Ae. speltoides. Both types of TdRGA-7B participated in tetraploid wheat formation. However, only the TdRGA-7Bb was retained in hexaploid wheat."

"26883668","abstracttext_main conclusion","New wheat- Secale africanum chromosome 5R (a) substitution and translocation lines were developed and identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization and molecular markers, and chromosome 5R (a) specific genes responsible for grain hardness were isolated. The wild species, Secale africanum Stapf. (genome R(a)R(a)), serves as a valuable germplasm resource for increasing the diversity of cultivated rye (S. cereale L., genome RR) and providing novel genes for wheat improvement. In the current study, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and molecular markers were applied to characterize new wheat-S. africanum chromosome 5R(a) derivatives. Labeled rye genomic DNA (GISH) and the Oligo-probes pSc119.2 and pTa535 (FISH) were used to study a wheat-S. africanum amphiploid and a disomic 5R(a) (5D) substitution, and to identify a T5DL.5R(a)S translocation line and 5R(a)S and 5R(a)L isotelosome lines. Twenty-one molecular markers were mapped to chromosome 5R(a) arms which will facilitate future rapid identification of 5R(a) introgressions in wheat backgrounds. Comparative analysis of the molecular markers mapped on 5R(a) with homoeologous regions in wheat confirmed a deletion on the chromosome T5DL.5R(a)S, which suggests that the wheat-S. africanum Robertsonian translocation involving homologous group 5 may not be fully compensating. Complete coding sequences at the paralogous puroindoline-a (Pina) and grain softness protein gene (Gsp-1) loci from S. africanum were cloned and localized onto the short arm of chromosome 5R(a). The S. africanum chromosome 5R(a) substitution and translocation lines showed a reduction in the hardness index, which may be associated with the S. africanum- specific Pina and Gsp-1 gene sequences. The present study reports the production of novel wheat-S. africanum chromosome 5R(a) stripe rust resistant derivatives and new rye-specific molecular markers, which may find application in future use of wild Secale genome resources for grain quality studies and disease resistance breeding."

"26563616","abstracttext","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play very important roles in plant defense responses. However, little is known about their roles in the susceptibility interaction between wheat and Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). In this study, two miRNA libraries were constructed from the leaves of the cultivar Xingzi 9104 inoculated with the virulent Pst race CYR32 and sterile water, respectively. A total of 1316 miRNA candidates, including 173 known miRNAs that were generated from 98 pre-miRNAs, were obtained. The remaining 1143 miRNA candidates included 145 conserved and 998 wheat-specific miRNAs that were generated from 87 and 1088 pre-miRNAs, respectively. The 173 known and 145 conserved miRNAs were sub-classified into 63 miRNA families. The target genes of wheat miRNAs were also confirmed using degradome sequencing technology. Most of the annotated target genes were related to signal transduction or energy metabolism. Additionally, we found that miRNAs and their target genes form complicated regulation networks. The expression profiles of miRNAs and their corresponding target genes were further analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and the results indicate that some miRNAs are involved in the compatible wheat-Pst susceptibility interaction. Importantly, tae-miR1432 was highly expressed when wheat was challenged with CYR32, and the corresponding target gene, predicted to be a calcium ion-binding protein, also exhibited upregulated expression but a divergent expression trend. PC-3P-7484, a specific wheat miRNA, was highly expressed in the wheat response to Pst infection, while the expression of the corresponding target gene ubiquillin was dramatically downregulated. These data provide the foundation for evaluating the important regulatory roles of miRNAs in wheat-Pst susceptibility interaction."

"27405473","abstracttext_background","Î²-carotene, the most active provitamin A molecule produced by plants, plays important roles in human nutrition and health. Î²-carotene does not usually accumulate in the endosperm (i.e. flour) of mature wheat grains, which is a major food source of calories for humans. Therefore, enriching Î²-carotene accumulation in wheat grain endosperm will enable a sustainable dietary supplementation of provitamin A. Several metabolic genes affecting Î²-carotene accumulation have already been isolated from wheat, including phytoene synthase 1 (PSY1), lycopene Îµ-cyclase (LCYe) and carotenoid Î²-ring hydroxylase1/2 (HYD1/2)."
"27405473","abstracttext_results","In this work, we cloned and biochemically characterized two carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs), CCD1 and CCD4, from wheat.

When analyzed by real-time qPCR, PSY1, LCYe, HYD1/2 and CCD1/4 homoeologs showed distinct expression patterns in vegetative tissues and sections of developing tetraploid and hexaploid wheat grains, suggesting that carotenoid metabolic genes and homoeologs are differentially regulated at the transcriptional level in wheat."

"27246315","abstracttext_main conclusion","This study explored 6P chromosomal translocations in wheat, and determined the effects of 6P intercalary chromosome segments on kernel number per wheat spike. Exploiting and utilising gene(s) from wild relative species has become an essential strategy for wheat crop improvement. In the translocation line Pubing2978, the intercalary 6P chromosome segment from Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn. (2nÂ =Â 4xÂ =Â 28, PPPP) carried valuable multi-kernel gene(s) and was selected from the offspring of the common wheat plant Fukuho and the irradiated wheat-A. cristatum 6P disomic substitution line 4844-8. Genomic in situ hybridisation (GISH), dual-colour fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), and molecular markers were used to detect the small segmental 6P chromosome in the wheat background and its translocation breakpoint. Cytological studies demonstrated that Pubing2978 was a T1AS-6PL-1ASÂ·1AL intercalary translocation with 42 chromosomes. The breakpoint was located near the centromeric region on the wheat chromosome 1AS and was flanked by the markers SSR12 and SSR283 based on an F2 linkage map. The genotypic data, combined with the phenotypic information, implied that A. cristatum 6P chromosomal segment plays an important role in regulating the kernel number per spike (KPS). By comparison, the mean value of KPS in plants with translocations was approximately 10 higher than that in plants without translocations in three segregated populations. Moreover, the improvement in KPS was likely achieved by increasing both the spikelet number per spike (SNS) and the kernel number per spikelet. These excellent agronomic traits laid the foundation for further investigation of valuable genes and make the Pubing2978 line a promising germplasm for wheat breeding."

Although some wheat stress-related MYB TFs have been characterized, their involvement in response to high-temperature stress has not been properly studied."
"29157199","abstracttext_results","Six novel heat-induced MYB genes were identified by comparison with previously established de novo transcriptome sequencing data obtained from wheat plants subjected to heat treatment; genomic and complete coding sequences of these genes were isolated.

Phylogenetic analysis of the six TaMYBs and R2R3-MYBs from Arabidopsis revealed that all six proteins were in clades that contained stress-related MYB TFs. The expression profiles of TaMYB genes were different in wheat tissues and in response to various abiotic stresses and exogenous abscisic acid treatment. In transgenic Arabidopsis plants carrying TaMYB80 driven by the CaMV 35S promoter, tolerance to heat and drought stresses increased, which could be attributed to the increased levels of cellular abscisic acid."

"27777262","abstracttext","Tan spot and Septoria nodorum blotch (SNB) are important diseases of wheat caused by the necrotrophic fungi Pyrenophora tritici-repentis and Parastagonospora nodorum, respectively. The P. tritici-repentis necrotrophic effector (NE) Ptr ToxB causes tan spot when recognized by the Tsc2 gene. The NE ToxA is produced by both pathogens and has been associated with the development of both tan spot and SNB when recognized by the wheat Tsn1 gene. Most work to study these interactions has been conducted in common wheat, but little has been done in durum wheat. Here, quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of a segregating biparental population indicated that the Tsc2-Ptr ToxB interaction plays a prominent role in the development of tan spot in durum. However, analysis of two biparental populations indicated that the Tsn1-ToxA interaction was not associated with the development of tan spot, but was strongly associated with the development of SNB. Pa. nodorum expressed ToxA at high levels in infected Tsn1 plants, whereas ToxA expression in P. tritici-repentis was barely detectable, suggesting that the differences in disease levels associated with the Tsn1-ToxA interaction were due to differences in pathogen expression of ToxA These and previous results together indicate that: (1) the effects of Tsn1-ToxA on tan spot in common wheat can range from nonsignificant to highly significant depending on the host genetic background; (2) Tsn1-ToxA is not a significant factor for tan spot development in durum wheat; and (3) Tsn1-ToxA plays a major role in SNB development in both common and durum wheat. Durum and common wheat breeders alike should strive to remove both Tsc2 and Tsn1 from their materials to achieve disease resistance."

"30963678","abstracttext","Flour colour, kernel hardness, grain protein content and wet gluten content are important quality properties that determine end use in bread wheat. Here, a wheat 90K genotyping assay was used for a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the six quality-related traits in Chinese wheat cultivars in eight environments over four years. A total of 846 significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, explaining approximately 30% of the phenotypic variation on average, and 103 multienvironment-significant SNPs were detected in more than four environments. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping in the biparent population confirmed some important SNP loci. Moreover, it was determined that some important genes were associated with the six quality traits, including some known functional genes and annotated unknown functional genes. Of the annotated unknown functional genes, it was verified that TaRPP13L1 was associated with flour colour. Wheat cultivars or lines with TaRPP13L1-B1a showed extremely significantly higher flour redness and lower yellowness than those with TaRPP13L1-B1b in the Chinese wheat natural population and the doubled haploid (DH) population. Two tetraploid wheat lines with premature stop codons of the TaRPP13L1 gene mutagenized by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) showed extremely significantly higher flour redness and lower yellowness than wild type. Our data suggest that the TaRPP13L1 gene plays an important role in modulating wheat flour colour. This study provides useful information for further dissection of the genetic basis of flour colour and also provides valuable genes or genetic loci for marker-assisted selection to improve the process of breeding quality wheat in China."

The expression levels of a number of genes (9761 genes) were significantly altered within 2 hpi and continued to change during the entire 48âh experiment. Gene Ontology analysis showed that the downregulated DEGs were mainly enriched in photosynthesis and light harvesting, and the total chlorophyll content in wheat leaves was also significantly reduced after S. graminum infestation at 24 and 48âhpi. However, a number of related genes of the salicylic acid (SA)-mediated defence signalling pathway and MAPK-WRKY pathway were significantly upregulated at early feeding time points (2 and 6 hpi). In addition, the gene expression and activity of antioxidant enzymes, such as peroxidase and superoxide dismutase, were rapidly increased at 2, 6 and 12 hpi. DAB staining results showed that S. graminum feeding induced hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) accumulation at the feeding sites at 2 hpi, and increased H 2 O 2 production was detected with the increases in aphid feeding time. Pretreatment with diphenylene iodonium, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, repressed the H 2 O 2 accumulation and expression levels of SA-associated defence genes in wheat."
"32366323","abstracttext_conclusions","Our transcriptomic analysis revealed that defence-related pathways and oxidative stress in wheat were rapidly induced within hours after the initiation of aphid feeding. Additionally, NADPH oxidase plays an important role in aphid-induced defence responses and H 2 O 2 accumulation in wheat. These results provide valuable insight into the dynamic transcriptomic responses of wheat leaves to phytotoxic aphid feeding and the molecular mechanisms of aphid-plant interactions."
"30813892","articletitle","Myc-like transcriptional factors in wheat: structural and functional organization of the subfamily I members."
"30813892","abstracttext_background","Myc-like regulatory factors carrying the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain belong to a large superfamily of transcriptional factors (TFs) present in all eukaryotic kingdoms. In plants, the representatives of this superfamily regulate diverse biological processes including growth and development as well as response to various stresses. As members of the regulatory MBW complexes, they participate in biosynthesis of flavonoids. In wheat, only one member (TaMyc1) of the Myc-like TFs family has been studied, while structural and functional organization of further members remained uncharacterized. From two Myc-subfamilies described recently in the genomes of Triticeae tribe species, we investigated thoroughly the members of the subfamily I which includes the TaMyc1 gene."
"30813892","abstracttext_results","Comparison of the promoter regions of the Myc subfamily I members in wheat suggested their division into two groups (likely homoeologous sets): TaMyc-1 (TaMyc-A1/TaMyc1, TaMyc-B1, TaMyc-D1) and TaMyc-2 (TaMyc-A2 and TaMyc-D2). It was demonstrated that the TaMyc-D1 copy has lost its functionality due to the frame shift mutation. The study of functional features of the other four copies suggested some of them to be involved in the biosynthesis of anthocyanins. In particular, TaMyc-B1 is assumed to be a co-regulator of the gene TaC1-A1 (encoding R2R3-Myb factor) in the MBW regulatory complex activating anthocyanin synthesis in wheat coleoptile. The mRNA levels of the TaMyc-A1, TaMyc-B1, TaMyc-A2 and TaMyc-D2 genes increased significantly in wheat seedlings exposed to osmotic stress. Salinity stress induced expression of TaMyc-B1 and TaMyc-A2, while TaMyc-A1 was repressed."
"30813892","abstracttext_conclusions","The features of the structural and functional organization of the members of subfamily I of Myc-like TFs in wheat were determined. Myc-like co-regulator (TaMyc-B1) of anthocyanin synthesis in wheat coleoptile was described for the first time. The Myc-encoding genes presumably involved in response to drought and salinity were determined in wheat. The results obtained are important for further manipulations with Myc genes, aimed on increasing wheat adaptability."
"30706614","articletitle","Development of an Agrobacterium-delivered CRISPR/Cas9 system for wheat genome editing."
"30706614","abstracttext","CRISPR/Cas9 has been widely used for genome editing in many organisms, including important crops like wheat. Despite the tractability in designing CRISPR/Cas9, efficacy in the application of this powerful genome editing tool also depends on DNA delivery methods. In wheat, the biolistics based transformation is the most used method for delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 complex. Due to the high frequency of gene silencing associated with co-transferred plasmid backbone and low edit rate in wheat, a large T 0 transgenic plant population are required for recovery of desired mutations, which poses a bottleneck for many genome editing projects. Here, we report an Agrobacterium-delivered CRISPR/Cas9 system in wheat, which includes a wheat codon optimized Cas9 driven by a maize ubiquitin gene promoter and a guide RNA cassette driven by wheat U6 promoters in a single binary vector. Using this CRISPR/Cas9 system, we have developed 68 edit mutants for four grain-regulatory genes, TaCKX2-1, TaGLW7, TaGW2, and TaGW8, in T 0 , T 1 , and T 2 generation plants at an average edit rate of 10% without detecting off-target mutations in the most Cas9-active plants. Homozygous mutations can be recovered from a large population in a single generation. Different from most plant species, deletions over 10Â bp are the dominant mutation types in wheat. Plants homozygous of 1160-bp deletion in TaCKX2-D1 significantly increased grain number per spikelet. In conclusion, our Agrobacterium-delivered CRISPR/Cas9 system provides an alternative option for wheat genome editing, which requires a small number of transformation events because CRISPR/Cas9 remains active for novel mutations through generations."
"31751884","articletitle","Molecular evolution and structural variations in nuclear encoded chloroplast localized heat shock protein 26 (sHSP26) from genetically diverse wheat species."
"31751884","abstracttext","Heat shock proteins are an important class of molecular chaperones known to impart tolerance under high temperature stress. sHSP26, a member of small heat shock protein subfamily is specifically involved in protecting plant's photosynthetic machinery. The present study aimed at identifying and characterizing sequence and structural variations in sHSP26 from genetically diverse progenitor and non-progenitor species of wheat. In silico analysis identified three paralogous copies of TaHSP26 to reside on short arm of chromosome 4A while one homeologue each was localized on long arm of chromosome 4B and 4D of cultivated bread wheat. Wild DD-genome donor Aegilops tauschii carried an additional sHSP26 gene (AET4Gv20569400) which was absent in the cultivated DD genome of bread wheat. In vitro amplification of this novel gene in wild accessions of Ae. tauschii and synthetic hexaploid wheat but not in cultivated bread wheat validated this finding. Further, significant length polymorphism could be identified in exon1 from diverse sHSP26 sequences. Multiple sequence alignment of procured sequences revealed numerous sSNPs and nsSNPs. D3A, P125â¯L, Q242â¯K were designated as homeolog specific- while A49â¯G as non-progenitor specific amino acid replacements. A 9-bp indel in TmHSP26-1(GA) translated into a deletion of SPM amino acid segment in chloroplast specific conserved consensus region III. High degree of divergence in nucleotide sequence between cultivated and wild species appeared in the form of higher Ï values (Ka/Ks >1) indicating positive selection during the course of evolution. Phylogenetic analysis elucidated ancestral relationships between wheat sHSP26 proteins and orthologous proteins across plant kingdom. Overall, data mining approach may be employed as an effective pre-breeding strategy to identify and mobilize novel stress responsive genes and distinct allelic variants from wider germplasm collections of wheat to enhance climate resilience of present day elite wheat cultivars."

"32849679","abstracttext","In wheat breeding, improved quality traits, including grain quality and dough rheological properties, have long been a critical goal. To understand the genetic basis of key quality traits of wheat, two single-locus and five multi-locus GWAS models were performed for six grain quality traits and three dough rheological properties based on 19, 254 SNPs in 267 bread wheat accessions. As a result, 299 quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) within 105 regions were identified to be associated with these quality traits in four environments. Of which, 40 core QTN regions were stably detected in at least three environments, 19 of which were novel. Compared with the previous studies, these novel QTN regions explained smaller phenotypic variation, which verified the advantages of the multi-locus GWAS models in detecting important small effect QTNs associated with complex traits. After characterization of the function and expression in-depth, 67 core candidate genes involved in protein/sugar synthesis, histone modification and the regulation of transcription factor were observed to be associated with the formation of grain quality, which showed that multi-level regulations influenced wheat grain quality. Finally, a preliminary network of gene regulation that may affect wheat quality formation was inferred. This study verified the power and reliability of multi-locus GWAS methods in wheat quality trait research, and increased the understanding of wheat quality formation mechanisms. The detected QTN regions and candidate genes in this study could be further used for gene cloning and marker-assisted selection in high-quality breeding of bread wheat."

"33087133","abstracttext_background","Wheat yellow dwarf virus disease is infected by barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), which causes leaf yellowing and dwarfing symptoms in wheat, thereby posing a serious threat to China's food production. The infection of plant viruses can produce large numbers of vsiRNAs, which can target host transcripts and cause symptom development. However, few studies have been conducted to explore the role played by vsiRNAs in the interaction between BYDV-GAV and host wheat plants."
"33087133","abstracttext_methods","In this study, small RNA sequencing was conducted to profile vsiRNAs in BYDV-GAV-infected wheat plants. The putative targets of vsiRNAs were predicted by the bioinformatics software psRNATarget. RT-qPCR and VIGS were employed to identify the function of selected target transcripts. To confirm the interaction between vsiRNA and the target, 5' RACE was performed to analyze the specific cleavage sites."
"33087133","abstracttext_results","From the sequencing data, we obtained a total of 11,384 detected vsiRNAs. The length distribution of these vsiRNAs was mostly 21 and 22 nt, and an A/U bias was observed at the 5' terminus. We also observed that the production region of vsiRNAs had no strand polarity. The vsiRNAs were predicted to target 23,719 wheat transcripts. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis demonstrated that these targets were mostly involved in cell components, catalytic activity and plant-pathogen interactions. The results of RT-qPCR analysis showed that most chloroplast-related genes were downregulated in BYDV-GAV-infected wheat plants. Silencing of a chlorophyll synthase gene caused leaf yellowing that was similar to the symptoms exhibited by BYDV-GAV-inoculated wheat plants. A vsiRNA from an overlapping region of BYDV-GAV MP and CP was observed to target chlorophyll synthase for gene silencing. Next, 5' RACE validated that vsiRNA8856 could cleave the chlorophyll synthase transcript in a sequence-specific manner."
"33087133","abstracttext_conclusions","This report is the first to demonstrate that BYDV-GAV-derived vsiRNAs can target wheat transcripts for symptom development, and the results of this study help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying leaf yellowing after viral infection."

"32859149","abstracttext_background","Waterlogging is one of the most serious abiotic stresses affecting wheat-growing regions in China. Considerable differences in waterlogging tolerance have been found among different wheat varieties, and the mechanisms governing the waterlogging tolerance of wheat seeds during germination have not been elucidated."
"32859149","abstracttext_results","The results showed no significant difference between the germination rate of 'Bainong 207' (BN207) (after 72âh of waterlogging treatment) and that of the control seeds. However, the degree of emulsification and the degradation rate of endosperm cells under waterlogging stress were higher than those obtained with the control treatment, and the number of amyloplasts in the endosperm was significantly reduced by waterlogging. Transcriptomic data were obtained from seed samples (a total of 18 samples) of three wheat varieties, 'Zhoumai 22' (ZM22), BN207 and 'Bainong 607' (BN607), subjected to the waterlogging and control treatments. A comprehensive analysis identified a total of 2775 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In addition, an analysis of the correlations among the expression difference levels of DEGs and the seed germination rates of the three wheat varieties under waterlogging stress revealed that the relative expression levels of 563 and 398 genes were positively and negatively correlated with the germination rate of the wheat seeds, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses showed that the difference in the waterlogging tolerance among the three wheat varieties was related to the abundance of key genes involved in the glycolysis pathway, the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway, and the lactose metabolism pathway. The alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) gene in the endosperm of BN607 was induced immediately after short-term waterlogging, and the energy provided by the glycolysis pathway enabled the BN607 seeds to germinate as early as possible; in addition, the expression of the AP2/ERF transcription factor was upregulated to further enhance the waterlogging tolerance of this cultivar."

"2535510","abstracttext","The expression of a wheat genomic clone containing the entire coding sequence of the high molecular weight glutenin subunit 12 gene flanked by 2.6 kilobases of 5' and 1.5 kilobases of 3' sequences has been studied after introduction into tobacco. Seeds of different tobacco plants containing the full-length wheat genomic clone accumulated different amounts of intact high molecular weight glutenin subunit mRNA and of a polypeptide displaying the solubility, molecular weight, and antigenic properties of the high molecular weight glutenin subunit 12. The wheat protein accumulated without obvious degradation products and constituted up to approximately 0.1% of the total tobacco endosperm protein. Restriction fragments corresponding to 2.6 kilobases, 1.4 kilobases, and 433 base pairs of high molecular weight glutenin 5' upstream sequence were fused to the coding sequence of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in the vector polyCATter and transferred into tobacco. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase enzyme activity was detected only in the seed endosperm tissue of the transformed plants. It was detected in tobacco seeds 8 days after anthesis and persisted until seed maturity. It is concluded that 433 base pairs of high molecular weight glutenin upstream sequence are sufficient to confer endosperm-specific expression of this monocot gene in the dicot tobacco."
"1726722","articletitle","A trans-splicing model for the expression of the tripartite nad5 gene in wheat and maize mitochondria."
"1726722","abstracttext","The mitochondrial single-copy gene nad5 of wheat and maize consists of 5 exons located on three widely separated regions of the genome that are independently transcribed. The first region contains exons I and II separated by an atypical group II intron; in the second region is exon III (only 22 bp long), which is flanked upstream by a maturase-related open reading frame (ORF) and exon e of the nad1 gene, and downstream by a previously unidentified ORF (ORF143); in the third region are exons IV and V separated by a group II intron. In maize, this last domain is flanked upstream by the genes rps12, nad3, and tRNA(Ser) and downstream by a chloroplast tRNA(Cys). RNA editing occurs in wheat exons IV and V as C-to-U changes. A detailed analysis of the transcription of the nad5 gene in wheat and maize reveals that the exons are assembled into a 2.4-kb mRNA after two cis-splicing (between exons I and II and exons IV and V) and two trans-splicing events. The trans-splicing process involves the sequences flanking exons II, III, and IV that feature group II introns. A model is proposed for the assembly and maturation of the nad5 transcripts."

"8440244","abstracttext","The quality of the wheat grain is determined by the quantity and composition of storage proteins (prolamins) which are synthesized exclusively in endosperm tissue. We are investigating the mechanisms underlying the regulation of expression of a prolamin gene, the low molecular weight glutenin gene LMWG-1D1. The LMWG-1D1 promoter contains the endosperm box, a sequence motif highly conserved in the promoter region of a large number of storage protein genes, which is thought to confer endosperm-specific expression of prolamin genes. Here we show by in vivo DMS footprinting of wheat endosperm tissue that the endosperm box becomes occupied by putative trans-acting factors during grain ripening. During early stages of development the endosperm motif within the 5' half of the endosperm box becomes occupied first, followed by binding of a second activity to a GCN4/jun-like motif in the 3' half just prior to the stage of maximum gene expression. Occupancy of the endosperm box is highly tissue-specific: no protection was observed in husk and leaf tissues. Several binding activities were identified in vitro from nuclear protein extracts of wheat endosperm which bind specifically to the endosperm and GCN4/jun motifs identified by in vivo footprinting."

"16117855","abstracttext","Wheat 1BL/1RS translocations are widely planted in China as well as in most of the wheat producing area in the world for their good qualities of disease resistance and high yield. 1BL/1RS translocations are however poor in bread making, partially caused by a family of small monomeric proteins, omega-secalins, which are encoded by genes on 1RS. Based on published sequence of a rye omega-secalin gene we designed a pair of primers to cover the whole mature protein coding sequence. A major band could be amplified from 1BL/1RS translocations but not from euploid wheat. Using this primer set we conducted PCR amplification by using high fidelity Pfu polymerase on the genomic DNAs and cDNAs purified from a 1BL/1RS translocation Lankao 906. Sequencing analysis indicated that this gene family contains several members of 1150 bp, 1076 bp, 1075 bp, 1052 bp and 1004 bp genes, including two pseudogenes and three active genes. The gene transcripts were differentially expressed in developing seeds."

"18470182","abstracttext","A targeted mapping strategy using representational difference analysis (RDA) was employed to isolate new restriction fragment length polymorphism probes for the long arm of chromosome 6 in rye (6RL), which carries a gene for resistance to Hessian fly larvae. Fragments from the 6RL arm were specifically isolated using a 'Chinese Spring' (CS) wheat - rye ditelosomic addition line (CSDT6RL) as tester, and CS and (or) CS4R as the driver for the genomic subtraction. Three RDA experiments were performed using BamHI amplicons, two of which were successful in producing low-copy clones. All low-copy clones were confirmed to have originated from 6RL, indicating substantial enrichment for target sequences. Two mapping populations, both of which are derived from a cross between two similar wheat-rye translocation lines, were used to map five RDA probes as well as five wheat probes. One of the populations was prescreened for recombinants by C-banding analysis. Fifteen loci, including seven new RDA markers, were placed on a map of the distal half of 6RL. The Hessian fly resistance gene was localized by mapping and C-banding analysis to approximately the terminal 1% of the arm. The utility of RDA as a method of targeted mapping in cereals and prospects for map-based cloning of the resistance gene are discussed."

"15190366","abstracttext","One of the major environmental factors limiting plant productivity is lack of water. This is especially true for the major cereals maize, rice, and wheat, which demonstrate a range of susceptibility to moisture deficit. Although conventional breeding and marker-assisted selection are being used to develop varieties more tolerant to water stress, these methods are time and resource consuming and germplasm dependent. Genetic engineering is attractive because of its potential to improve abiotic stress tolerance more rapidly. Transcription factors have been shown to produce multiple phenotypic alterations, many of which are involved in stress responses. DREB1A, a transcription factor that recognizes dehydration response elements, has been shown in Arabidopsis thaliana to play a crucial role in promoting the expression of drought-tolerance genes. In our efforts to enhance drought tolerance in wheat, the A. thaliana DREB1A gene was placed under control of a stress-inducible promoter from the rd29A gene and transferred via biolistic transformation into bread wheat. Plants expressing the DREB1A gene demonstrated substantial resistance to water stress in comparison with checks under experimental greenhouse conditions, manifested by a 10-day delay in wilting when water was withheld."

"16191595","abstracttext","Nitrogen is the major determinant of crop yield and quality and the precise management of nitrogen fertilizer is an important issue for farmers and environmentalists. Despite this, little is known at the level of gene expression about the response of field crops to different amounts and forms of nitrogen fertilizer. Here we use expressed sequence tag (EST)-based wheat microarrays in combination with the oldest continuously running agricultural experiment in the world to show that gene expression is significantly influenced by the amount and form of nitrogenous fertilizer. In the Broadbalk winter wheat experiment at Rothamsted in the United Kingdom and at three other diverse test sites, we show that specific genes have surprisingly different expression levels in the grain endosperm when nitrogen is supplied either in an organic or an inorganic form. Many of the genes showing differential expression are known to participate in nitrogen metabolism and storage protein synthesis. However, others are of unknown function and therefore represent new leads for future investigation. Our observations show that specific gene expression is diagnostic for use of organic sources of nitrogen fertilizer and may therefore have useful applications in defining the differences between organically and conventionally grown wheat.

"20195568","abstracttext","New races of wheat stem rust, namely TTKSK (Ug99) and its variants, pose a threat to wheat production in the regions where they are found. The accession of the wheat cultivar Webster (RL6201) maintained at the Cereal Research Centre in Winnipeg, Canada, shows resistance to TTKSK and other races of stem rust. The purpose of this study was to study the inheritance of seedling resistance to stem rust in RL6201 and genetically map the resistance genes using microsatellite (SSR) markers. A population was produced by crossing the stem rust susceptible line RL6071 with Webster. The F(2) and F(3) were tested with TPMK, a stem rust race native to North America. The F(3) was also tested with TTKSK. Two independently assorting genes were identified in RL6201. Resistance to TPMK was conferred by Sr30, which was mapped with microsatellites on chromosome 5DL. The second gene, temporarily designated SrWeb, conferred resistance to TTKSK. SrWeb was mapped to chromosome 2BL using SSR markers. Comparison with previous genetic maps showed that SrWeb occupies a locus near Sr9. Further analysis will be required to determine if SrWeb is a new gene or an allele of a previously identified gene."

"19909822","abstracttext","Head blight or scab caused by Fusarium graminearum is a destructive disease of wheat and barley. The pathogen can cause severe yield losses and contaminates infested kernels with harmful mycotoxins. In this study, we characterized the CID1 gene in F. graminearum that is an ortholog of the Fusarium verticilloidesFCC1 and yeast UME3 genes. The protein encoded by CID1 has typical structural features of C-type cyclins. Deletion of CID1 resulted in a reduction in conidiation and vegetative growth but an increase in pigmentation. The Deltacid1 mutant was female sterile but could outcross as a male. It was significantly reduced in DON production and virulence on wheat heads and corn stalks. Only about 50% of inoculated spikelets developed scab symptoms and scab disease rarely extended to nearby florets, suggesting that the Deltacid1 mutant was defective in colonizing and spreading in wheat heads. Deletion of CID1 resulted in reduced expression levels of TRI5 and TRI101 but increased PKS12 expression. When expressed in F. verticillioides, the CID1 gene complemented the defects of the Deltafcc1 mutant in conidiation, hyphal growth, and fumonisin production. Our data indicate that the CID1 C-type cyclin gene plays multiple roles in the regulation of vegetative growth, sexual development, conidiation, DON production, and pathogenicity."

"22668001","abstracttext","Hessian fly (HF) is a biotrophic insect that interacts with wheat on a gene-for-gene basis. We profiled changes in membrane lipids in two isogenic wheat lines: a susceptible line and its backcrossed offspring containing the resistance gene H13. Our results revealed a 32 to 45% reduction in total concentrations of 129 lipid species in resistant plants during incompatible interactions within 24 h after HF attack. A smaller and delayed response was observed in susceptible plants during compatible interactions. Microarray and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses of 168 lipid-metabolism-related transcripts revealed that the abundance of many of these transcripts increased rapidly in resistant plants after HF attack but did not change in susceptible plants. In association with the rapid mobilization of membrane lipids, the concentrations of some fatty acids and 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) increased specifically in resistant plants. Exogenous application of OPDA increased mortality of HF larvae significantly. Collectively, our data, along with previously published results, indicate that the lipids were mobilized through lipolysis, producing free fatty acids, which were likely further converted into oxylipins and other defense molecules. Our results suggest that rapid mobilization of membrane lipids constitutes an important step for wheat to defend against HF attack."

"22446929","abstracttext","Wheat leaf rust, stem rust, stripe rust, and powdery mildew caused by the fungal pathogens Puccinia triticina, P. graminis f. sp. tritici, P. striiformis f. sp. tritici, and Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, respectively, are destructive diseases of wheat worldwide. Breeding durable disease resistance cultivars rely largely on continually introgressing new resistance genes, especially the genes with different defense mechanisms, into adapted varieties. Here, we describe a new resistance gene obtained by mutagenesis. The mutant, MNR220 (mutagenesis-derived new resistance), enhances resistance to three rusts and powdery mildew, with the characteristics of delayed disease development at the seedling stage and completed resistance at the adult plant stage. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the resistance in MNR220 is conferred by a single semidominant gene mapped on the short arm of chromosome 2B. Gene expression profiling of several pathogenesis-related genes indicated that MNR220 has an elevated and rapid pathogen-induced response. In addition to its potential use in breeding for resistance to multiple diseases, high-resolution mapping and cloning of the disease resistance locus in MNR220 may lead to a better understanding of the regulation of defense responses in wheat."

Physical mapping, sequencing, annotation and candidate gene validation of an NUE metaQTL on wheat chromosome 3B allowed us to propose that a glutamate synthase (GoGAT) gene that is conserved structurally and functionally at orthologous positions in rice, sorghum and maize genomes may contribute to NUE in wheat and other cereals. We propose an evolutionary model for the NUE locus in cereals from a common ancestral region, involving species specific shuffling events such as gene deletion, inversion, transposition and the invasion of repetitive elements."

Using a pair of near-isogenic lines (NILs) that should differ only in a small chromosome segment containing the Cre locus, we screened 58 group-2 probes and found two (Tag605 and CDO588) that detect polymorphism between the NILs. Nulli-tetrasomic and ditelosomic lines confirmed that the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers identified were derived from the long arm of wheat chromosome 2. Crosses between ""AUS 10894"" and ""Spear"" and the NIL ""AP"" and its recurrent parent ""Prins"" were used to produce F2 populations that gave the expected 3â¶1 segregation ratio for the resistance gene.

The chitinase gene chi1 of S. proteamaculans 336x was cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein exhibited chitinase activity and in vitro antifungal activity against G. graminis var. tritici. With in-frame deletion of the chi1 gene by homologous recombination, the chi1-deleted mutant was devoid of chitinase activity and the biocontrol efficacy was reduced by 42.5%. The complementation of the Îchi1 mutant strain by the chi1 gene resulted in the partial restoration of the chitinase activity and biocontrol efficacy. These results support a role for the Chi1 protein in the biocontrol process of S. proteamaculans 336x against wheat take-all."
"25845019","articletitle","Necrotrophic effector epistasis in the Pyrenophora tritici-repentis-wheat interaction."
"25845019","abstracttext","Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, the causal agent of tan spot disease of wheat, mediates disease by the production of host-selective toxins (HST). The known toxins are recognized in an 'inverse' gene-for-gene manner, where each is perceived by the product of a unique locus in the host and recognition leads to disease susceptibility. Given the importance of HSTs in disease development, we would predict that the loss of any of these major pathogenicity factors would result in reduced virulence and disease development. However, after either deletion of the gene encoding the HST ToxA or, reciprocally, heterologous expression of ToxA in a race that does not normally produce the toxin followed by inoculation of ToxA-sensitive and insensitive wheat cultivars, we demonstrate that ToxA symptom development can be epistatic to other HST-induced symptoms. ToxA epistasis on certain ToxA-sensitive wheat cultivars leads to genotype-specific increases in total leaf area affected by disease. These data indicate a complex interplay between host responses to HSTs in some genotypes and underscore the challenge of identifying additional HSTs whose activity may be masked by other toxins. Also, through mycelial staining, we acquire preliminary evidence that ToxA may provide additional benefits to fungal growth in planta in the absence of its cognate recognition partner in the host."

"26815536","abstracttext","Powdery mildew, one of the most destructive wheat diseases worldwide, is caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), a fungal species with a consistently high mutation rate that makes individual resistance (R) genes ineffective. Therefore, effective resistance-related gene cloning is vital for breeding and studying the resistance mechanisms of the disease. In this study, a putative nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) R gene (TaRGA) was cloned using a homology-based cloning strategy and analyzed for its effect on powdery mildew disease and wheat defense responses. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyses revealed that a Bgt isolate 15 and salicylic acid stimulation significantly induced TaRGA in the resistant variety. Furthermore, the silencing of TaRGA in powdery mildew-resistant plants increased susceptibility to Bgt15 and prompted conidia propagation at the infection site. However, the expression of TaRGA in leaf segments after single-cell transient expression assay highly increased the defense responses to Bgt15 by enhancing callose deposition and phenolic autofluorogen accumulation at the pathogen invading sites. Meanwhile, the expression of pathogenesis-related genes decreased in the TaRGA-silenced plants and increased in the TaRGA-transient-overexpressing leaf segments. These results implied that the TaRGA gene positively regulates the defense response to powdery mildew disease in wheat."

"29218377","abstracttext_key message","A major gene conferring resistance to bacterial leaf streak was mapped to chromosome 5R in triticale. Bacterial leaf streak (BLS), caused by Xanthomonas translucens pv. undulosa (Xtu), is an important disease of wheat and triticale around the world. Although resistance to BLS is limited in wheat, several triticale accessions have high levels of resistance. To characterize the genetic basis of this resistance, we developed triticale mapping populations using a resistant accession (Siskiyou) and two susceptible accessions (UC38 and Villax St. Jose). Bulked segregant analysis in an F 2 population derived from the cross of SiskiyouÂ ÃÂ UC38 led to the identification of a simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker (XSCM138) on chromosome 5R that co-segregated with the resistance gene. The cross of SiskiyouÂ ÃÂ Villax St. Jose was advanced into an F 2:5 recombinant inbred line population and evaluated for BLS reaction. Genetic linkage maps on this population were assembled with markers generated using genotyping-by-sequencing as well as several SSR markers previously identified on 5R. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping revealed a single major QTL on chromosome 5R, underlined by the same SSR marker as in the SiskiyouÂ ÃÂ UC38 population. The F 1 hybrids of the two crosses were highly resistant to BLS, indicating that resistance is largely dominant. This work will facilitate introgression of this rye-derived BLS resistance gene into the wheat genome by molecular marker-mediated chromosome engineering."

"28614737","abstracttext","Algicidal bacteria offer a promising option for killing Microcystis aeruginosa, one notorious cyanobacteria causing harmful algal blooms. In this study, Citrobacter sp. R1 presented high algicidal activity (81.6Â±2.2%, 72h) against M. aeruginosa when cultured using glucose, while it showed no algicidal activity (0Â±3.4%) when cultured using wheat bran, suggesting that appropriate carbon source is crucial for algicidal bacteria in killing M. aeruginosa. The underlying algicidal mechanism of strain R1 was explored by studying the effect of different carbon sources (glucose and wheat bran) on its key algicidal gene expression and total protein translation. While the glycogen synthase gene (glgA), cloned from strain R1 via transposon mutagenesis, was for the first time related to algicidal activity, its transcriptional level was not positively correlated with the algicidal activity of strain R1. We found that, the translation of total protein of strain R1 was relatively less when cultured with glucose, compared to growth with wheat bran. This indicated that the functional algicidal gene of strain R1 exerts its algicidal activity at protein translational level. These findings not only reveal the importance of appropriate carbon source for strain R1 for controlling M. aeruginosa, but also bring insights into its underlying algicidal mechanism."

"28588389","abstracttext","Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina , is a common wheat disease worldwide. Developing resistant cultivars through deploying new or pyramiding resistance genes in a suitable line, is the most effective approach to control this disease. However, to stack genes in a genotype, efficient and reliable markers are required. In the present study, F 2 plants and their corresponding F 3 families from a cross between the resistant line; Thatcher (Tc) Lr18, and the susceptible cultivar 'Boolani' were used to map rust resistance gene, Lr18 using SSR markers on chromosome 5BL of hexaploid wheat. The P. triticina pathotype no 15 was used to inoculate plants. Out of 20 primers tested, eight showed polymorphism between the two parents and were subsequently genotyped in the entire F 2 population. The markers Xgpw7425 and Xwmc75 flanked the locus at a distance of 0.3 and 1.2 cM, respectively. Analysis of 81 genotypes from different backgrounds with these two markers confirmed their usefulness in screening absence or presence of Lr18 . Therefore, these markers can be used for gene postulation and marker-assisted selection (MAS) of this gene in wheat breeding programs in future."

"27540093","abstracttext","Plants producing antisense or double-stranded RNA molecules that target specific genes of eukaryotic pests or pathogens can become protected from their attack. This beneficial effect was also reported for plant-fungus interactions and is believed to reflect uptake of the RNAs by the fungus via an as yet unknown mechanism, followed by target gene silencing. Here we report that wheat plants pre-infected with Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) strains containing antisense sequences against target genes of the Fusarium head blight (FHB) fungus F. culmorum caused a reduction of corresponding transcript levels in the pathogen and reduced disease symptoms. Stable transgenic wheat plants carrying an RNAi hairpin construct against the Î²-1, 3-glucan synthase gene FcGls1 of F. culmorum or a triple combination of FcGls1 with two additional, pre-tested target genes also showed enhanced FHB resistance in leaf and spike inoculation assays under greenhouse and near-field conditions, respectively. Microscopic evaluation of F. culmorum development in plants transiently or stably expressing FcGls1 silencing constructs revealed aberrant, swollen fungal hyphae, indicating severe hyphal cell wall defects. The results lead us to propose host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) as a plant protection approach that may also be applicable to highly FHB-susceptible wheat genotypes."

Line SN0224, derived from crosses between Th. ponticum and the common wheat cultivar Yannong15, was identified in the present study. Cytogenetic observations showed that SN0224 contains 42 chromosomes in the root-tip cells and 21 bivalents in the pollen mother cells, thereby demonstrating its cytogenetic stability. Genomic in situ hybridization, probed with the total genomic DNA of Th. ponticum, produced hybridization signals in the distal region of two wheat chromosome arms. After inoculation with the Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) isolates, SN0224 exhibited immunity. Segregation in F1s and F2s from the cross SN0224/cv. Huixianhong indicated that SN0224 carries a single dominant gene for powdery mildew (Pm) resistance, which was temporarily designated PmSn0224. Three markers Barc212, Xwmc522 and Xbarc1138 were detected to be linked with PmSn0224. Based on the locations of the markers, PmSn0224 was located on the chromosome 2A. None of the three markers above is linked with the previously reported PM resistance genes on chromosome 2A, and none of the previously reported PM resistance genes on chromosome 2A is related to Th. ponticum. Therefore, PmSn0224 is likely a novel gene putatively from Th. ponticum."

"28846721","abstracttext","The ability of plants to identify an optimal flowering time is critical for ensuring the production of viable seeds. The main environmental factors that influence the flowering time include the ambient temperature and day length. In wheat, the ability to assess the day length is controlled by photoperiod (Ppd) genes. Due to its allohexaploid nature, bread wheat carries the following three Ppd-1 genes: Ppd-A1, Ppd-B1 and Ppd-D1. While photoperiod (in)sensitivity controlled by Ppd-A1 and Ppd-D1 is mainly determined by sequence changes in the promoter region, the impact of the Ppd-B1 alleles on the heading time has been linked to changes in the copy numbers (and possibly their methylation status) and sequence changes in the promoter region. Here, we report that plants with the same number of Ppd-B1 copies may have different heading times. Differences were observed among F7 lines derived from crossing two spring hexaploid wheat varieties. Several lines carrying three copies of Ppd-B1 headed 16 days later than other plants in the population with the same number of gene copies. This effect was associated with changes in the gene expression level and methylation of the Ppd-B1 gene."

"28913803","abstracttext","Microspores are preferred explant choice for genetic transformation, as their use shortens the duration of obtaining homozygous transformants. All established gene-delivery methods of particle bombardment, electroporation, and cocultivation with Agrobacterium tumefaciens were optimized on androgenic microspores or derived tissues. In the biolistic gene delivery method 35-40Â days old haploid microspore embryoids were used for genetic transformation, whereas freshly isolated androgenic microspores were used for genetic transformation in the electroporation and Agrobacterium cocultivation-based methods. The genetic transformation methods of biolistic gene-delivery and electroporation gave rise to the chimeric plants, whereas the method involving cocultivation with Agrobacterium yielded homozygous transformants. These methods were tested on a large number of cultivars belonging to different market classes of wheat, and found to be fairly independent of the explant genotype. Other benefits of using microspores or derived tissues for transformation are: (1) a few explant donors are required to obtain desired transformants and (2) the time required for obtaining homozygous transformants is about 8Â months in case of spring wheat genotypes and about a year in case of winter wheat genotypes."

"29155326","abstracttext","The SWEET (sugars will eventually be exported transporter) family is a newly characterized group of sugar transporters. In plants, the key roles of SWEETs in phloem transport, nectar secretion, pollen nutrition, stress tolerance, and plant-pathogen interactions have been identified. SWEET family genes have been characterized in many plant species, but a comprehensive analysis of SWEET members has not yet been performed in wheat. Here, 59 wheat SWEETs (hereafter TaSWEETs) were identified through homology searches. Analyses of phylogenetic relationships, numbers of transmembrane helices (TMHs), gene structures, and motifs showed that TaSWEETs carrying 3-7 TMHs could be classified into four clades with 10 different types of motifs. Examination of the expression patterns of 18 SWEET genes revealed that a few are tissue-specific while most are ubiquitously expressed. In addition, the stem rust-mediated expression patterns of SWEET genes were monitored using a stem rust-susceptible cultivar, 'Little Club' (LC). The resulting data showed that the expression of five out of the 18 SWEETs tested was induced following inoculation. In conclusion, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the wheat SWEET gene family. Information regarding the phylogenetic relationships, gene structures, and expression profiles of SWEET genes in different tissues and following stem rust disease inoculation will be useful in identifying the potential roles of SWEETs in specific developmental and pathogenic processes."

"29556921","abstracttext","The wheat TaMyc1 gene encodes for transcriptional factor (TF) with bHLH domain. The gene is expressed in purple wheat grains and activates transcription of the anthocyanin biosynthesis structural genes. To reveal the features of TaMyc1 regulation in wheat pericarp transcription start sites (TSS) were identified by 5' RACE mean and translation efficiency was predicted by in silico methods. Three alternative transcript variants of TaMyc1 differing by 5' leader sequence only were identified in purple pericarp. The three transcripts are generated from distinct TATA boxes and thereby are differed by TSS. Two transcripts (TaMyc1a, -b) have identical initiation AUG codons that lead to the TaMYC1 regulatory protein with bHLH domain. However because of different stability of secondary structures predicted in 5' leader the two transcripts might be translated with different efficiency. The third transcript is assumed to be not effectively translated. qRT-PCR and colonies counting were applied to assess contribution each of the transcripts to total TaMyc1 gene transcription level. TaMyc1c has the lowest contribution (ca. 16%), whereas the others two transcripts contribute equally (ca. 42%) to total TaMyc1 expression level. The role of the tree mRNA isoforms transcribed in one tissue is discussed."

Blumeria effector candidate ( BEC ) 1019, a highly conserved metalloprotease of Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei ( Bgh ), is essential for fungal haustorium formation, and silencing BEC1019 significantly reduces Bgh virulence. In this study, we found that BEC1019 homologs in B. graminis f. sp. tritici ( Bgt ) and Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici ( Ggt ) have complete sequence identity with those in Bgh , prompting us to investigate their functions. Transcript levels of BEC1019 were abundantly induced concomitant with haustorium formation in Bgt and necrosis development in Ggt -infected plants. BEC1019 overexpression considerably increased wheat susceptibility to Bgt and Ggt , whereas silencing this gene using host-induced gene silencing significantly enhanced wheat resistance to Bgt and Ggt , which was associated with hydrogen peroxide accumulation, cell death, and pathogenesis-related gene expression. Additionally, we found that the full and partial sequences of BEC1019 can trigger cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. These results indicate that Bgt and Ggt can utilize BEC1019 as a virulence effector to promote plant colonization, and thus these genes represent promising new targets in breeding wheat cultivars with broad-spectrum resistance."

As many as 57 gene specific SSRs were discovered among genomic sequences of identified TaSPXs. MicroRNA target analysis revealed that TaSPX genes were targeted by 9 different miRNAs including tae-miR1120a, tae-miR1120b-3p, tae-miR1120c-5p, tae-miR1122b-3p, tae-miR1122c-3p, tae-miR1130a, tae-miR1130b-3p, tae-miR1137a, and tae-miR1137b-5p. Expression profiles derived from transcriptome data and real-time quantitative PCR revealed that TaSPX genes were significantly induced by Pi starvation. The modeled 3D structure of wheat SPX proteins shared high level of homology with template structures, providing information to understand their functions at proteomic level. We have also refined the modeled 3D structures on 10â¯ns using molecular dynamics simulations for conformational stability. The discovered members of SPX gene family and their targeting miRNAs may provide resource for genetic improvement and promote P use efficiency in cereals."

Transient expression assays indicated that TaAMT2;3a was located to the cell and nuclear membranes. TaAMT2;3a successfully complemented the function of a yeast mutant defective in NH 4 + transport, indicating its ammonium transport capacity. Function of TaAMT2;3a in wheat-Pst interaction was further analyzed by barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV)-induced gene silencing. Pst growth was significantly retarded in TaAMT2;3a-knockdown plants, in which ammonium in leaves were shown to be induced at the early stage of infection.

"31244566","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a devastating wheat disease with a significant economic impact. Fhb1 is the most important large effect and stable QTL for FHB resistance. A pore-forming toxin-like ( PFT ) gene was recently identified as an underlying gene for Fhb1 resistance. In this study, we developed and validated a PFT -based Kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASP) marker for Fhb1 . The KASP marker, PFT_KASP, was used to screen 298 diverse wheat breeding lines and cultivars. The KASP clustering results were compared with gel-based gene specific markers and the widely used linked STS marker, UMN10. Eight disagreements were found between PFT_KASP and UMN10 assays among the tested lines. Based on the genotyping and sequencing of genes in the Fhb1 region, these genotypes were found to be common with a previously characterized susceptible haplotype. Therefore, our results indicate that PFT_KASP is a perfect diagnostic marker for Fhb1 and would be a valuable tool for introgression and pyramiding of FHB resistance in wheat cultivars."

"32979565","abstracttext","Plant genome sequencing has dramatically increased, and some species even have multiple high-quality reference versions. Demands for clade-specific homology inference and analysis have increased in the pangenomic era. Here we present a novel method, GeneTribe (https://chenym1.github.io/genetribe/), for homology inference among genetically similar genomes that incorporates gene collinearity and shows better performance than traditional sequence-similarity-based methods in terms of accuracy and scalability. The Triticeae tribe is a typical allopolyploid-rich clade with complex species relationships that includes many important crops, such as wheat, barley, and rye. We built Triticeae-GeneTribe (http://wheat.cau.edu.cn/TGT/), a homology database, by integrating 12 Triticeae genomes and 3 outgroup model genomes and implemented versatile analysis and visualization functions. With macrocollinearity analysis, we were able to construct a refined model illustrating the structural rearrangements of the 4A-5A-7B chromosomes in wheat as two major translocation events. With collinearity analysis at both the macro- and microscale, we illustrated the complex evolutionary history of homologs of the wheat vernalization gene Vrn2, which evolved as a combined result of genome translocation, duplication, and polyploidization and gene loss events. Our work provides a useful practice for connecting emerging genome assemblies, with awareness of the extensive polyploidy in plants, and will help researchers efficiently exploit genome sequence resources."

The formation of powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici) or leaf rust (Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici) colonies was significantly reduced on leaves from afp or chitinase II- but not from rip I-expressing wheat lines compared with non-transgenic controls. The increased resistance of afp and chitinase II lines was dependent on the dose of fungal spores used for inoculation. Heterologous expression of the fungal afp gene and the barley chitinase II gene in wheat demonstrated that colony formation and, thereby, spreading of two important biotrophic fungal diseases is inhibited approximately 40 to 50% at an inoculum density of 80 to 100 spores per cm2."

"10985048","abstracttext","Durable resistance to greenbug, Schizaphis graminum (Rondani), in wheat is a goal of wheat improvement teams, and one that has been complicated by the regular occurrence of damaging biotypes. Simulation modeling studies suggest that pyramiding resistance genes, i.e., combining more than one resistance gene in a single cultivar or hybrid, may provide more durable resistance than sequential releases of single genes. We examined this theory by pyramiding resistance genes in wheat and testing a series of greenbug biotypes. Resistance genes Gb2, Gb3, and Gb6, and pyramided genes Gb2/Gb3, Gb2/Gb6, and Gb3/Gb6 were tested for effectiveness against biotypes E, F, G, H, and I. By comparing reactions of plants with pyramided genes to those with single resistance genes, we found that pyramiding provided no additional protection over that conferred by the single resistance genes. Based on the results of this test, we concluded that the sequential release of single resistance genes, combined with careful monitoring of greenbug population biotypes, is the most effective gene deployment strategy for greenbug resistance in wheat."

The transcriptional regulation via the type I element is thought to occur through interactions between transcription factors which bind specifically to the Hex and Oct motifs. Here we report S phase-specific DNA-binding proteins interacting with the type I element in partially synchronized wheat cultured cells. Hex motif-binding proteins found here resembled HBP-1a, as reported previously in terms of DNA-binding specificity. DNA-binding activities of the HBP-1a-like proteins were modulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. In the electrophoretic mobility shift assay of the wheat nuclear extract, we also found three Oct motif-specific binding proteins, named OBRF (octamer-binding regulatory factor)-1, -2 and -3. One of the HBP-1a-like proteins and OBRF-1 appeared predominantly at the S phase. Thus, it was supposed that these two factors play a crucial role in the S phase-specific regulation of wheat histone gene expression."

Here, we have investigated, at the microscopic and molecular levels, the reaction of barley cultivars to wheat leaf rust infection. In the nonhost resistant cultivar Cebada Capa, abortion of fungal growth occurred at both pre- and posthaustorial stages, suggesting that defense genes are expressed throughout the development of the inappropriate fungus during the nonhost resistance reaction. In the two barley lines L94 and Bowman, a low level of prehaustorial resistance to P. triticina was observed and susceptibility was comparable to that of wheat control plants. Suppression subtractive hybridization was used to identify genes that are differentially expressed during the nonhost resistance reaction in Cebada Capa as well as during the successful establishment of the inappropriate wheat leaf rust fungus in L94. Northern analysis indicated that two candidate genes, including a barley ortholog of the rice resistance gene Xa21, are putatively involved in nonhost and non-race-specific resistance reactions. In addition, a new gene that is specifically induced during the successful development of the inappropriate fungus P. triticina in barley has been identified."

Like other fungal pathogens, F. graminearum secretes various extracellular enzymes, which are hypothesized to be involved in host infection. Extracellular lipolytic activity of F. graminearum was strongly induced in culture by wheat germ oil; this allowed us to isolate, clone, and characterize a gene (FGL1) encoding a secreted lipase. Expression analysis indicated that FGL1 is induced by lipid-containing substrates and repressed by glucose. In planta, FGL1 transcription was detected 1 day post-infection of wheat spikes. The function of the FGL1 gene product was verified by specifically demonstrating lipase activity after expression in a heterologous host. Ebelactone B, a known lipase inhibitor, repressed the lipolytic activity of the enzyme. Disease severity was strongly reduced when wild-type conidia were supplemented with ebelactone B. Transformation-mediated disruption of FGL1 led to reduced extracellular lipolytic activity in culture and to reduced virulence to both wheat and maize."

"15700423","abstracttext","Differences in gene expression between salinity stressed and normally grown wheat seedlings were compared by the differential display (DD) technique. One DD-derived cDNA clone was characterized as a partial sequence of the wheat asparagine ynthetase (AS) gene by sequence analysis and homology search of GenBank databases. Two AS genes of wheat, TaASN1 and TaASN2, were further isolated by the RT-PCR approach. Comparison of the deduced polypeptide of TaASN1 and TaASN2 with AS proteins from other organisms revealed several homologous regions, in particular, the conserved glutamine binding sites and Class-II Glutamine amidotransferases domain. The functionality of TaASN1 was demonstrated by complementing an Escherichia coli asparagine auxotroph. TaASN1 transcripts were detected in roots, shoots, anthers and young spikes by RT-PCR analysis. Abundance of TaASN1 mRNA in young spikes and anthers was higher than that in shoots and roots under normal growth conditions. TaASN1 was dramatically induced by salinity, osmotic stress and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) in wheat seedlings. TaASN2 transcripts were very low in all detected tissues and conditions and were only slightly induced by ABA in roots."
"15895202","articletitle","Identification of quantitative trait loci for race-nonspecific resistance to tan spot in wheat."
"15895202","abstracttext","Tan spot, caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr), is an economically important foliar disease in the major wheat growing areas throughout the world. Multiple races of the pathogen have been characterized based on their ability to cause necrosis and/or chlorosis on differential wheat lines. In this research, we evaluated a population of recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between the common wheat varieties Grandin and BR34 for reaction to tan spot caused by Ptr races 1-3 and 5. Composite interval mapping revealed QTLs on the short arm of chromosome 1B and the long arm of chromosome 3B that were significantly associated with resistance to all four races. The effects of the two QTLs varied for the different races. The 1B QTL explained from 13% to 29% of the phenotypic variation, whereas the 3B QTL explained from 13% to 41% of the variation. Additional minor QTLs were detected but not associated with resistance to all races. The host-selective toxin Ptr ToxA, which is produced by races 1 and 2, was not a significant factor in the development of disease in this population. The race-nonspecific resistance derived from BR34 may take precedence over the gene-for-gene interaction known to be associated with the wheat-Ptr system."

"15996988","abstracttext","The origin of tetraploid wheat and the divergence of diploid ancestors of wheat A and D genomes were estimated to have occurred 0.36 and 2.7 million years ago, respectively. These estimates and the evolutionary history of 3159 gene loci were used to estimate the rates with which gene loci have been deleted and duplicated during the evolution of wheat diploid ancestors and during the evolution of polyploid wheat. During diploid evolution, the deletion rate was 2.1 x 10(-3) locus(-1) MY(-1) for single-copy loci and 1.0 x 10(-2) locus(-1) MY(-1) for loci in paralogous sets. Loci were duplicated with a rate of 2.9 x 10(-3) locus(-1) MY(-1) during diploid evolution. During polyploid evolution, locus deletion and locus duplication rates were 1.8 x 10(-2) and 1.8 x 10(-3) locus(-1) MY(-1), respectively. Locus deletion and duplication rates correlated positively with the distance of the locus from the centromere and the recombination rate during diploid evolution. The functions of deleted and duplicated loci were inferred to gain insight into the surprisingly high rate of deletions of loci present apparently only once in a genome. The significance of these findings for genome evolution at the diploid and polyploid level is discussed."

"16372189","abstracttext","The Tsn1 gene in wheat confers sensitivity to a proteinaceous host-selective toxin (Ptr ToxA) produced by the tan spot fungus (Pyrenophora tritici-repentis) and lies within a gene-rich region of chromosome 5B. To use the rice genome sequence information for the map-based cloning of Tsn1, colinearity between the wheat genomic region containing Tsn1 and the rice genome was determined at the macro- and microlevels. Macrocolinearity was determined by testing 28 expressed sequence markers (ESMs) spanning a 25.5-cM segment and encompassing Tsn1 for similarity to rice sequences. Twelve ESMs had no similarity to rice sequences, and 16 had similarity to sequences on seven different rice chromosomes. Segments of colinearity with rice chromosomes 3 and 9 were identified, but frequent rearrangements and disruptions occurred. Microcolinearity was determined by testing the sequences of 26 putative genes identified from BAC contigs of 205 and 548 kb in length and flanking Tsn1 for similarity to rice genomic sequences. Fourteen of the predicted genes detected orthologous sequences on six different rice chromosomes, whereas the remaining 12 had no similarity with rice sequences. Four genes were colinear on rice chromosome 9, but multiple disruptions, rearrangements, and duplications were observed in wheat relative to rice. The data reported provide a detailed analysis of a region of wheat chromosome 5B that is highly rearranged relative to rice."
"14871306","articletitle","A wheat gene encoding an aluminum-activated malate transporter."
"14871306","abstracttext","The major constraint to plant growth in acid soils is the presence of toxic aluminum (Al) cations, which inhibit root elongation. The enhanced Al tolerance exhibited by some cultivars of wheat is associated with the Al-dependent efflux of malate from root apices. Malate forms a stable complex with Al that is harmless to plants and, therefore, this efflux of malate forms the basis of a hypothesis to explain Al tolerance in wheat. Here, we report on the cloning of a wheat gene, ALMT1 (aluminum-activated malate transporter), that co-segregates with Al tolerance in F2 and F3 populations derived from crosses between near-isogenic wheat lines that differ in Al tolerance. The ALMT1 gene encodes a membrane protein, which is constitutively expressed in the root apices of the Al-tolerant line at greater levels than in the near-isogenic but Al-sensitive line. Heterologous expression of ALMT1 in Xenopus oocytes, rice and cultured tobacco cells conferred an Al-activated malate efflux. Additionally, ALMT1 increased the tolerance of tobacco cells to Al treatment. These findings demonstrate that ALMT1 encodes an Al-activated malate transporter that is capable of conferring Al tolerance to plant cells."

"16858583","abstracttext","MADS-box genes form a large family of transcription factors and play important roles in flower development and organ differentiation in plants. In this study, 42 wheat cDNAs encoding putative MADS-box genes were isolated. BLASTX searches and phylogenetic analysis indicated that the cDNAs represented 12 of the 14 MADS-box gene subfamilies. TaAGL14 and TaAGL15 formed a new subfamily along with a rice gene OsMADS32. RT-PCR analysis revealed that these genes had different exprsssion patterns in different organs of different stages. Expression patterns of TaAGL1 and TaAGL29 were also determined using in situ hybridization. TaAGL1 was abundantly expressed in primary root tips and the whole spikelet with more intense labeling at lodicules, paleas and stamens. TaAGL29 was expressed in both the non-reproductive parts (lemma, palea and glumes), and stamens and pistils. Moreover, differential expression patterns of these genes were also observed between wheat hybrid and its parents in leaf, stem and root of jointing stage, some were up-regulated while others were down-regulated in hybrid as compared to its parents. We concluded that multiple MADS-box genes exist in wheat genome and are expressed in tissue-specific patterns, and might play important roles in wheat growth and development."

"16850190","abstracttext","A full-length cDNA encoding wheat peroxisomal ascorbate peroxidase (pAPX) was cloned by Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) and in silico approach. The cDNA was 1027 bp in length and contained a complete ORF of 876 bp, which encodes a protein of 292 amino acid residues. Its deduced amino acids sequence had 84% identity with that of pAPX from barley. The gene was designated as Ta-pAPX. The Ta-pAPX homologous genes were mapped on wheat chromosome 7A and 7D using Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic lines analysis. Northern analysis indicated that, after inoculation by Erysiphe graminis Dc.f.sp. tritici, the expression of Ta-pAPX gene in Yangmai5 was enhanced, but its expression in wheat-Haynaldia villosa 6VS/6AL translocation lines changed a little. The results implied that Ta-pAPX may be related to susceptibility of wheat to powdery mildew. The complete coding sequence of Ta-pAPX was cloned into an expression vector pET32 (a+) and a protein with the same deduced molecular weight (MW) was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3), which showed ascorbate peroxidase activity."

Two specific fragments were obtained. By cloning and sequencing these two specific fragments, it was showed that the specific fragment amplified by primer P1 had 268bp, and the fragment amplified by P2 had 227bp. They were named AFLP marker P1(268) and P2(227) respectively. Linkage analysis of these two markers revealed that the polymorphism existed in a 106 F2 segregating population. These two markers closely linked to a powdery mildew resistance gene in wheat cultivar Brock, linkage distance were 3.6 and 1.9 cM respectively. These two markers will be useful for marker-assisted selection and gene pyramiding in wheat resistance breeding."

The BC(4)F(3) ILs had a 10% increased thousand grain weight compared to the control group and the recurrent parent 'Prinz', and 84.7% of the phenotypic variance could be explained by the segregation of marker Xgwm1002-7D, suggesting the presence of a gene modulating grain weight, which was preliminarily designated gw1. It was possible to delimit the QTL QTgw.ipk-7D to the interval Xgwm295-Xgwm1002, which is located in the most telomeric bin 7DS4-0.61-1.00 in the physical map of wheat chromosome arm 7DS. Furthermore, our data suggest the presence of a novel plant height-reducing locus Rht on chromosome arm 7DS of 'Prinz'. Larger grain and increased plant height may reflect the pleiotropic action of one gene or may be caused by two linked genes. In general, our data support the concept of using nearly isogenic ILs for validating and dissecting QTLs into single Mendelian genes and open the gateway for map-based cloning of a grain-weight QTL in wheat."

Protein analysis in grains of F(1) and F(2) and backcross progenies of BC(1)F(1), BC(1)F(2), BC(1)F(3), BC(2)F(1), BC(2)F(2) and BC(2)F(3) by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the transgenes 1Dx5 and 1Ax1 were expressed and segregated in the target wheat according to Mendelian laws. A range of 1Dx5 expression levels were observed in the progenies of Chuan89-107x72-8-11b and Emai18x72-8-11b, but the expression levels of 1Ax1 in progenies of Chuan89-107x102-1-2 rarely changed.

"17660693","abstracttext","Mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) is the terminal oxidase responsible for cyanide-insensitive and salicylhydroxamic acid-sensitive respiration in plants. AOX is a key enzyme of the alternative respiration pathway. To study the effects of necrotic cell death on the mitochondrial function, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), respiration capacities and accumulation patterns of mitochondria-targeted protein-encoding gene transcripts were compared between wild-type, lesion-mimic mutant and hybrid necrosis wheat plants. Around cells with the necrosis symptom, ROS accumulated abundantly in the intercellular spaces. The ratio of the alternative pathway to the cytochrome pathway was markedly enhanced in the necrotic leaves. Transcripts of a wheat AOX gene, Waox1a, were more abundant in a novel lesion-mimic mutant of common wheat than in the wild-type plants. An increased level of the Waox1a transcripts was also observed in hybrid plants containing Ne1 and Ne2 genes. These results indicated that an increase of the wheat AOX transcript level resulted in enhancement of respiration capacity of the alternative pathway in the necrotic cells."

"16661776","abstracttext","The effects of gibberellin in two wheat varieties, Nainari 60 and D6899, have been studied. D6899 is a dwarf wheat having a single locus mutation, the Rht 3 gene (""Tom Thumb"" gene), which is located on chromosome 4A. When compared with the standard height wheat variety, Nainari 60, D6899 does not have a slowdown in cellular metabolism such as respiration rate, protein content, rate of protein synthesis, and uptake of amino acids. The content of ATP is even higher in D6899. However, all of the gibberellin-mediated physiological processes that we have studied, including leaf elongation, synthesis and release of hydrolytic enzymes, and secretion of phosphate ions and reducing sugars in aleurone layers, are retarded in D6899. D6899 and Nainari 60 have essentially the same uptake and metabolism of gibberellin and their levels of endogenous inhibitors such as abscisic acid do not differ drastically. The dosage-response curve of the gibberellin-mediated alpha-amylase production indicates that a rate-limiting step, which is common to many of the diverse gibberellin responses, is partially blocked in D6899 wheat."

"19888815","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum, a devastating pathogen of small grains, overwinters on crop residues and produces ephemeral perithecia. Accumulation of lipids in overwintering hyphae would provide reserves for overwinter survival and perithecium development. Fatty acid composition of cultures during perithecium development indicated a drop in neutral lipid levels during development but little change in fatty acid composition across stages. Microscopic examination of cultures early in sexual development revealed hyphal cells engorged with lipid bodies. In comparison, vegetative hyphae contained few lipid bodies. Microarray analysis was performed on wheat stems at stages of colonization through perithecium development. Gene expression analysis during stages of perithecium development both in planta and in vitro (previously published) supports the view that lipid biosynthesis occurs during early stages of wheat colonization leading to sexual development and that lipid oxidation occurs as perithecia are developing. Analysis of gene expression during the stages of wheat stem colonization also revealed sets of genes unique to these stages. These results support the view that lipids accumulate in hyphae colonizing wheat stalks and are subsequently used in perithecium formation on stalk tissue. These results indicate that extensive colonization of plant tissue prior to harvest is essential for subsequent sporulation on crop residues and, thus, has important implications for inoculum reduction."

"21919737","abstracttext","A spontaneous interspecific Robertsonian translocation was revealed by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) in the progenies of a monosomic 7H addition line originating from a new wheat 'Asakaze komugi' Ã barley 'Manas' hybrid. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with repetitive DNA sequences (Afa family, pSc119.2, and pTa71) allowed identification of all wheat chromosomes, including wheat chromosome arm 4BS involved in the translocation. FISH using barley telomere- and centromere-specific repetitive DNA probes (HvT01 and (AGGGAG)(n)) confirmed that one of the arms of barley chromosome 7H was involved in the translocation. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers specific to the long (L) and short (S) arms of barley chromosome 7H identified the translocated chromosome segment as 7HL. Further analysis of the translocation chromosome clarified the physical position of genetically mapped SSRs within 7H, with a special focus on its centromeric region. The presence of the HvCslF6 gene, responsible for (1,3;1,4)-Î²-D-glucan production, was revealed in the centromeric region of 7HL. An increased (1,3;1,4)-Î²-D-glucan level was also detected in the translocation line, demonstrating that the HvCslF6 gene is of potential relevance for the manipulation of wheat (1,3;1,4)-Î²-D-glucan levels."

"22748104","abstracttext","Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most abundant type of molecular genetic marker and can be used for producing high-resolution genetic maps, marker-trait association studies and marker-assisted breeding. Large polyploid genomes such as wheat present a challenge for SNP discovery because of the potential presence of multiple homoeologs for each gene. AutoSNPdb has been successfully applied to identify SNPs from Sanger sequence data for several species, including barley, rice and Brassica, but the volume of data required to accurately call SNPs in the complex genome of wheat has prevented its application to this important crop. DNA sequencing technology has been revolutionized by the introduction of next-generation sequencing, and it is now possible to generate several million sequence reads in a timely and cost-effective manner. We have produced wheat transcriptome sequence data using 454 sequencing technology and applied this for SNP discovery using a modified autoSNPdb method, which integrates SNP and gene annotation information with a graphical viewer. A total of 4,694,141 sequence reads from three bread wheat varieties were assembled to identify a total of 38â928 candidate SNPs. Each SNP is within an assembly complete with annotation, enabling the selection of polymorphism within genes of interest."

"20795855","abstracttext","Defender against cell death (DAD) genes are known to function as negative regulators of cell death in animals. In plants, DAD orthologs are conserved but their role in cell death regulation is not well understood. Here, we report the characterization of the TaDAD2 gene in wheat. The predicted amino acid sequence of TaDAD2 contains typical structural features of DAD proteins, including a signal peptide, three transmembrane regions, and a subunit of oligosaccharyltransferase. Transcripts of TaDAD2 were detected in wheat leaves, culms, roots, florets, and spikelets. The expression level of TaDAD2 was reduced in the initial contact with the stripe rust fungus, subsequently induced and peaked at 18 h postinoculation (hpi), gradually reduced at 24 to 48 hpi, and restored to control level at 72 to 120 hpi. In addition, TaDAD2 exhibited positive transcriptional responses to abiotic stresses after the initial reduction at 1 hpi. Overexpression of TaDAD2 in tobacco leaves inhibited cell death. Furthermore, knocking down TaDAD2 expression by virus-induced gene silencing enhanced the susceptibility of wheat cv. Suwon11 to avirulent race CYR23 and reduced necrotic area at the infection sites. These results indicate that TaDAD2 may function as a suppressor of cell death in the early stages of wheat-stripe rust fungus interaction. However, it is dispensable for or plays an opposite role in hypersensitive response or cell death triggered by an avirulent race of stripe rust fungus at late-infection stages."

Interaction of ToxA with the chloroplast-localized protein ToxABP1 has been implicated in this process. Therefore, we hypothesized that silencing of ToxABP1 in wheat would lead to a necrotic phenotype. Also, because ToxABP1 is highly conserved in plants, internal expression of ToxA in plants that do not normally internalize ToxA should result in cell death. *Reduction of ToxABP1 expression was achieved using Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV)-mediated, viral-induced gene silencing. The BSMV system was modified for use as an internal expression vector for ToxA in monocots. Agrobacterium-mediated expression of ToxA in a dicot (tobacco-Nicotiana benthamiana) was also performed. *Viral-induced gene silencing of ToxABP1 partially recapitulates the phenotype of ToxA treatment and wheat plants with reduced ToxABP1 also have reduced sensitivity to ToxA. When ToxA is expressed in ToxA-insensitive wheat, barley (Hordeum vulgare) and tobacco, cell death ensues. *ToxA accumulation in any chloroplast-containing cell is likely to result in cell death. Our data indicate that the ToxA-ToxABP1 interaction alters ToxABP1 function. This interaction is a critical, although not exclusive, component of the ToxA-induced cell death cascade."

"21315476","abstracttext","Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) has emerged as a vector for virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in cereals, having been used to study a number of genes involved in resistance in both wheat and barley. However, the effects of the BSMV vector on plant physiology and disease resistance in plants remains unexplored. The BSMV inoculation control vector, BSMV:GFP was shown to cause severe viral symptoms in wheat, displaying chlorosis, leaf curling and growth inhibition typical of the symptoms seen in BSMV-infected barley. These viral symptoms were accompanied by induction of genes implicated in defense against pathogens, namely PR1, PR4, PR5, PR10 and PAL. Subsequent inoculation of BSMV:GFP-infected wheat with a wheat pathotype of Magnaporthe oryzae, the blast pathogen, resulted in decreased susceptibility. Penetration of epidermal cells and subsequent multiple cell colonization by M. oryzae was significantly reduced. This increased restriction of pathogen growth observed for BSMV:GFP infections with and without the viral coat protein gene. However, prior infection with BSMV:GFP had no effect on the development of a compatible isolate of Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, the causal agent of powdery mildew."

Such libraries were constructed from flow-sorted arms of wheat chromosome 7D. A library from the short arm (7DS) consisting of 49,152 clones with 113âkb insert size represented 12.1 arm equivalents whereas a library from the long arm (7DL) comprised 50,304 clones of 116âkb providing 14.9x arm coverage. The 7DS library was PCR screened with markers linked to Russian wheat aphid resistance gene DnCI2401, the 7DL library was screened by hybridization with a probe linked to greenbug resistance gene Gb3. The small number of clones combined with high coverage made the screening highly efficient and cost effective."

"21298301","abstracttext","Elucidating resistance mechanisms of plant cells against pathogens is essential to develop novel strategies of disease control. The actin cytoskeleton was found intimately involved in plant defense. In order to reveal how actin would be involved in the interaction between wheat and the stripe rust Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, prior to fungal inoculation, wheat leaves were treated with cytochalasin A, an inhibitor of actin polymerization. Our results showed reduced incidence of hypersensitive cell death and delayed accumulation of H(2)O(2) in wheat leaves treated with cytochalasin A compared to the control. We also found that the TaPRO profilin gene exhibited significantly different expression levels in host leaves when comparing compatible and incompatible interactions. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the expression transcript of TaPRO was lower at each time point in incompatible interactions when compared to compatible ones, and the largest difference between the two interactions occurred at 12 h post-inoculation. Both pharmacological and gene expression results collectively support the notion that the compromise of the actin microfilament is linked to the compatible interaction between the stripe rust fungus and the leaves of its wheat host."

"22436033","abstracttext","Common wheat is an allohexaploid species, derived through endoreduplication of an interspecific triploid hybrid produced from a cross between cultivated tetraploid wheat and the wild diploid relative Aegilops tauschii. Hybrid incompatibilities, including hybrid necrosis, have been observed in triploid wheat hybrids. A limited number of A. tauschii accessions show hybrid lethality in triploid hybrids crossed with tetraploid wheat as a result of developmental arrest at the early seedling stage, which is termed severe growth abortion (SGA). Despite the potential severity of this condition, the genetic mechanisms underlying SGA are not well understood. Here, we conducted comparative analyses of gene expression profiles in crown tissues to characterize developmental arrest in triploid hybrids displaying SGA. A number of defense-related genes were highly up-regulated, whereas many transcription factor genes, such as the KNOTTED1-type homeobox gene, which function in shoot apical meristem (SAM) and leaf primordia, were down-regulated in the crown tissues of SGA plants. Transcript accumulation levels of cell cycle-related genes were also markedly reduced in SGA plants, and no histone H4-expressing cells were observed in the SAM of SGA hybrid plants. Our findings demonstrate that SGA shows unique features among other types of abnormal growth phenotypes, such as type II and III necrosis."

New wheat - S. africanum chromosome 1R(afr) addition, 1R(afr)(1D) substitution, 1BL.1R(afr)S and 1DS.1R(afr)L translocation, and 1R(afr)L monotelocentric addition lines were identified by chromosome banding and in situ hybridization. Disease resistance screening revealed that chromosome 1R(afr)S carries resistance gene(s) to new stripe rust races. Twenty-nine molecular markers were localized on S. africanum chromosome 1R(afr) by the wheat - S. africanum introgression lines. Twenty markers can also identically amplify other reported wheat - S. cereale chromosome 1R derivative lines, indicating that there is high conservation between the wild and cultivated Secale chromosome 1R. Nine markers displayed polymorphic amplification between S. africanum and S. cereale chromosome 1R(afr) derivatives. The comparison of the nucleotide sequences of these polymorphic markers suggested that gene duplication and sequence divergence may have occurred among Secale species during its evolution and domestication."

CI17884 carried a 4DL.4Ai-2S translocation which substituted for chromosome 4D. CI17766 carried a 4AL.4Ai-2S translocation substituting for chromosome 4A. The results show that the 4Ai-2 chromosome is related to homoeologous group 4 and that the resistance gene(s) against WSMV is located on the short arm of 4Ai-2. In addition, CI17882, CI17884, and CI17885 contained Ae. speltoides chromosome 7S substituting for chromosome 7A of wheat. The greenbug resistance gene Gb5 was located on chromosome 7S."

"24240852","abstracttext","Sixteen allosyndetic recombinants involving chromosome arms 1DS and 1RS derived from the wheat-rye translocation 1DL-1RS, and one 1RS recombinant derived from 1BL-1RS were characterised by cytological, biochemical and molecular methods. Analysis of isozyme markers showed that recombination had involved different breakpoints along the 1DS arm. The gene order Tri-D1 - Per-D1 - Gpi-D1 - Gli-D1 was established on chromosome 1DS, and this is consistent with the gene order known to occur on 1BS. The use of three molecular probes for loci on 1RS confirmed one of the recombinants obtained from the 1BL-1RS translocation, and two of the three recombinants obtained from the 1DL-1RS translocation. These two recombinant chromosomes appear to have approximately reciprocal structures and may prove of direct benefit to wheat breeders as they retain the stem rust resistance of the parental translocation but have recovered some of the 1D encoded proteins which are absent in 1DL-1RS lines and which are thought to affect dough quality. A 5S RNA site was discovered on chromosome arm 1DS, probably reflecting the homoeologous relationship of this chromosome with 1BS. Segregational analysis indicated that some of the homoeologous wheat-wheat exchanges probably involved more than a single allosyndetic event."

"24226350","abstracttext","The cereal cyst nematode,Heterodera avenue Wollenweber, is a serious pest of cereals in many countries. A high level of resistance to the unique Australian pathotype of the nematode has been demonstrated in a triticale line (T701-4-6), which was originally obtained from CIMMYT. The level of resistance is similar to that in rye cultivar, South Australian, but higher than that in the wheat line (AUS 10894), hitherto reported to have useful resistance to the Australian pathotype. The gene for resistance was located on rye chromosome 6 (6R) after backcrossing the T701-4-6 line to wheat and correlating the resistance with the presence of individual rye chromosomes identified by morphological, cytological, and isozyme markers. Preliminary evidence suggests that the gene is located on the long arm of6R. To transfer the resistance to wheat, double monosomics of6R and6D in aph1bph1b homozygous background were selected from F2 progeny from a cross of disomic6R substitution for6D to theph1b mutant. Selfed seeds from these F2 plants will be screened for wheat-rye chromosome recombinants."

"24920004","abstracttext","Host specialization by pathogens requires a repertoire of virulence factors as well as fine-tuned regulation of gene expression. The fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici (synonym Mycosphaerella graminicola) is a powerful model system for the discovery of genetic elements that underlie virulence and host specialization. We transcriptionally profiled the early stages of Z. tritici infection of a compatible host (wheat) and a noncompatible host (Brachypodium distachyon). The results revealed infection regulatory programs common to both hosts and genes with striking wheat-specific expression, with many of the latter showing sequence signatures of positive selection along the Z. tritici lineage. Genes specifically regulated during infection of wheat populated two large clusters of coregulated genes that may represent candidate pathogenicity islands. On evolutionarily labile, repeat-rich accessory chromosomes (ACs), we identified hundreds of highly expressed genes with signatures of evolutionary constraint and putative biological function. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that gene duplication events on these ACs were rare and largely preceded the diversification of Zymoseptoria species. Together, our data highlight the likely relevance for fungal growth and virulence of hundreds of Z. tritici genes, deepening the annotation and functional inference of the genes of this model pathogen."

"25727347","abstracttext","Wheat, maize, rye and certain other agriculturally important species in the Poaceae family produce the benzoxazolinone class of phytoalexins on pest and pathogen attack. Benzoxazolinones can inhibit the growth of pathogens. However, certain fungi can actively detoxify these compounds. Despite this, a clear link between the ability to detoxify benzoxazolinones and pathogen virulence has not been shown. Here, through comparative genome analysis of several Fusarium species, we have identified a conserved genomic region around the FDB2 gene encoding an N-malonyltransferase enzyme known to be involved in benzoxazolinone degradation in the maize pathogen Fusarium verticillioides. Expression analyses demonstrated that a cluster of nine genes was responsive to exogenous benzoxazolinone in the important wheat pathogen Fusarium pseudograminearum. The analysis of independent F.âpseudograminearumâFDB2 knockouts and complementation of the knockout with FDB2 homologues from F.âgraminearum and F. verticillioides confirmed that the N-malonyltransferase enzyme encoded by this gene is central to the detoxification of benzoxazolinones, and that Fdb2 contributes quantitatively to virulence towards wheat in head blight inoculation assays. This contrasts with previous observations in F. verticillioides, where no effect of FDB2 mutations on pathogen virulence towards maize was observed. Overall, our results demonstrate that the detoxification of benzoxazolinones is a strategy adopted by wheat-infecting F.âpseudograminearum to overcome host-derived chemical defences."

"26771740","abstracttext","Cellulose is the primary determinant of mechanical strength in plant tissues. Late-season lodging is inversely related to the amount of cellulose in a unit length of the stem. Wheat is the most widely grown of all the crops globally, yet information on its CesA gene family is limited. We have identified 22 CesA genes from bread wheat, which include homoeologs from each of the three genomes, and named them as TaCesAXA, TaCesAXB or TaCesAXD, where X denotes the gene number and the last suffix stands for the respective genome. Sequence analyses of the CESA proteins from wheat and their orthologs from barley, maize, rice, and several dicot species (Arabidopsis, beet, cotton, poplar, potato, rose gum and soybean) revealed motifs unique to monocots (Poales) or dicots. Novel structural motifs CQIC and SVICEXWFA were identified, which distinguished the CESAs involved in the formation of primary and secondary cell wall (PCW and SCW) in all the species. We also identified several new motifs specific to monocots or dicots. The conserved motifs identified in this study possibly play functional roles specific to PCW or SCW formation. The new insights from this study advance our knowledge about the structure, function and evolution of the CesA family in plants in general and wheat in particular. This information will be useful in improving culm strength to reduce lodging or alter wall composition to improve biofuel production."

"26555900","abstracttext","Catalases are reactive oxygen species scavenging enzymes involved in response to abiotic and biotic stresses. In this study, we described the isolation and functional characterization of a novel catalase from durum wheat, designed TdCAT1. Molecular Phylogeny analyses showed that wheat TdCAT1 exhibited high amino acids sequence identity to other plant catalases. Sequence homology analysis showed that TdCAT1 protein contained the putative calmodulin binding domain and a putative conserved internal peroxisomal targeting signal PTS1 motif around its C-terminus. Predicted three-dimensional structural model revealed the presence of four putative distinct structural regions which are the N-terminal arm, the Î²-barrel, the wrapping and the Î±-helical domains. TdCAT1 protein had the heme pocket that was composed by five essential residues. TdCAT1 gene expression analysis showed that this gene was induced by various abiotic stresses in durum wheat. The expression of TdCAT1 in yeast cells and Arabidopsis plants conferred tolerance to several abiotic stresses. Compared with the non-transformed plants, the transgenic lines maintained their growth and accumulated more proline under stress treatments. Furthermore, the amount of H2O2 was lower in transgenic lines, which was due to the high CAT and POD activities. Taken together, these data provide the evidence for the involvement of durum wheat catalase TdCAT1 in tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses in crop plants."

"28466509","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight of wheat is one of the most serious and hazardous crop diseases worldwide. Here, a transcriptomic investigation of Fusarium graminearum reveals a new model for symptomless and symptomatic wheat infection. The predicted metabolic state and secretome of F.Â graminearum were distinct within symptomless and symptomatic wheat tissues. Transcripts for genes involved in the biosynthesis of the mycotoxin, deoxynivalenol, plus other characterized and putative secondary metabolite clusters increased in abundance in symptomless tissue. Transcripts encoding for genes of distinct groups of putative secreted effectors increased within either symptomless or symptomatic tissue. Numerous pathogenicity-associated gene transcripts and transcripts representing PHI-base mutations that impacted on virulence increased in symptomless tissue. In contrast, hydrolytic carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) and lipase gene transcripts exhibited a different pattern of expression, resulting in elevated transcript abundance during the development of disease symptoms. Genome-wide comparisons with existing datasets confirmed that, within the wheat floral tissue, at a single time point, different phases of infection co-exist, which are spatially separated and reminiscent of both early and late infection. This study provides novel insights into the combined spatial temporal coordination of functionally characterized and hypothesized virulence strategies."

Bacillus cereus 905, a rhizosphere bacterium originally isolated from wheat roots, colonizes the wheat rhizosphere with a large population size. We previously showed that a manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD2), encoded by the sodA2 gene, plays an important role in colonization of the wheat rhizosphere by B. cereus 905. In this study, we identified a gene, ptsI, which positively regulates transcription of sodA2. ptsI encodes Enzyme I of the phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major regulator of carbohydrate uptake in bacteria. Assays of Î²-galactosidase activity and real-time quantitative PCR showed that loss of ptsI caused a 70% reduction in sodA2 expression. The ÎptsI mutant also showed a 1000-fold reduction in colonization of wheat roots, as well as a reduced growth rate in minimal media with either glucose or succinate as the sole carbon source. Artificial induction of sodA2 in the ÎptsI mutant partially restored root colonizing ability and utilization of succinate, but not glucose. These results suggest that the PTS plays an important role in rhizosphere colonization by both promoting nutrient utilization and regulating sodA2 expression in B. cereus 905."

"27252028","abstracttext","We identified a wheat stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis) effector candidate (PEC6) with pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) suppression function and its corresponding host target. PEC6 compromised PTI host species-independently. In Nicotiana benthamiana, it hampers reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and callose deposition induced by Pseudomonas fluorescens. In Arabidopsis, plants expressing PEC6 were more susceptible to PseudomonasÂ syringae pv. tomato (Pto) DC3000 ÎAvrPto/ÎAvrPtoB. In wheat, PEC6-suppression of P.Â fluorescens-elicited PTI was revealed by the fact that it allowed activation of effector-triggered immunity by Pto DC3000. Knocking down of PEC6 expression by virus-mediated host-induced gene silencing decreased the number of rust pustules, uncovering PEC6 as an important pathogenicity factor. PEC6, overexpressed in plant cells without its signal peptide, was localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm. A yeast two-hybrid assay showed that PEC6 interacts with both wheat and Arabidopsis adenosine kinases (ADKs). Knocking down wheat ADK expression by virus-induced gene silencing reduced leaf growth and enhanced the number of rust pustules, indicating that ADK is important in plant development and defence. ADK plays essential roles in regulating metabolism, cytokinin interconversion and methyl transfer reactions, and our data propose a model where PEC6 may affect one of these processes by targeting ADK to favour fungal growth."

This study was initiated to fine map these two genes toward map-based cloning. Comparative genomics study showed that macrocolinearity exists between L. chromosome 1 (Bd1) and the - region, which allowed us to develop markers based on the wheat sequences orthologous to genes contained in the Bd1 region.

"28134278","abstracttext","A Chinese wheat mini core collection was genotyped using the wheat 9âK iSelect SNP array. Total 2420 and 2396 polymorphic SNPs were detected on the A and the B genome chromosomes, which formed 878 haplotype blocks. There were more blocks in the B genome, but the average block size was significantly (Pâ<â0.05) smaller than those in the A genome. Intense selection (domestication and breeding) had a stronger effect on the A than on the B genome chromosomes. Based on the genetic pedigrees, many blocks can be traced back to a well-known Strampelli cross, which was made one century ago. Furthermore, polyploidization of wheat (both tetraploidization and hexaploidization) induced revolutionary changes in both the A and the B genomes, with a greater increase of gene diversity compared to their diploid ancestors. Modern breeding has dramatically increased diversity in the gene coding regions, though obvious blocks were formed on most of the chromosomes in both tetraploid and hexaploid wheats. Tag-SNP markers identified in this study can be used for marker assisted selection using haplotype blocks as a wheat breeding strategy. This strategy can also be employed to facilitate genome selection in other self-pollinating crop species."

"28228774","abstracttext","Auxin Regulated Gene involved in Organ Size (ARGOS) is significantly and positively associated with organ size and is involved in abiotic stress responses in plants. However, no studies on wheat ARGOS genes have been reported to date. In the present study, three TaARGOS homoeologous genes were isolated and located on chromosomes 4A, 4B, and 4D of bread wheat, all of which are highly conserved in wheat and its wild relatives. Comparisons of gene expression in different tissues demonstrated that the TaARGOSs were mainly expressed in the stem. Furthermore, the TaARGOS transcripts were significantly induced by drought, salinity, and various phytohormones. Transient expression of the TaARGOS-D protein in wheat protoplasts showed that TaARGOS-D localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, overexpression of TaARGOS-D in Arabidopsis resulted in an enhanced germination rate, larger rosette diameter, increased rosette leaf area, and higher silique number than in wild-type (WT) plants. The roles of TaARGOS-D in the control of plant growth were further studied via RNA-seq, and it was found that 105 genes were differentially expressed; most of these genes were involved in 'developmental processes.' Interestingly, we also found that overexpression of TaARGOS-D in Arabidopsis improved drought and salinity tolerance and insensitivity to ABA relative to that in WT plants. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the TaARGOSs are involved in seed germination, seedling growth, and abiotic stress tolerance."

"28990484","abstracttext","Leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina is an important disease of wheat in many regions worldwide. Durable or long-lasting leaf rust resistance has been difficult to achieve because populations of P. triticina are highly variable for virulence to race-specific resistance genes, and respond to selection by resistance genes in released wheat cultivars. The wheat cultivar Toropi, developed and grown in Brazil, was noted to have long-lasting leaf rust resistance that was effective only in adult plants. The objectives of this study were to determine the chromosome location of the leaf rust resistance genes derived from Toropi in two populations of recombinant inbred lines in a partial Thatcher wheat background. In the first population, a single gene with major effects on chromosome 5DS that mapped 2.2 centimorgans distal to IWA6289, strongly reduced leaf rust severity in all 3 years of field plot tests. This gene for adult plant leaf rust resistance was designated as Lr78. In the second population, quantitative trait loci (QTL) with small effects on chromosomes 1BL, 3BS, and 4BS were found. These QTL expressed inconsistently over 4 years of field plot tests. The adult plant leaf rust resistance derived from Toropi involved a complex combination of QTL with large and small effects."

Many genes influence KUE in plants, but it is not clear how these genes function in the field. We identified the V-type H + -pyrophosphatase gene EdVP1 from Elymus dahurica. Gene expression analysis showed that EdVP1 was induced by low potassium stress. Protein subcellular localization analysis demonstrated that EdVP1 localized on the plasma membrane. We overexpressed EdVP1 in two wheat varieties and conducted K tolerance experiments across years. Yield per plant, grain number per spike, plant height, and K uptake of four transgenic wheat lines increased significantly compared with WT; results from two consecutive years showed that EdVP1 significantly increased yield and KUE of transgenic wheat. Pot experiments showed that transgenic plants had significantly longer shoots and roots, and higher K accumulation in shoots and roots and H + -PPase activity in shoots than WT under low K. A fluidity assay of potassium ion in EdVP1 transgenic plant roots showed that potassium ion influx and H + outflow in transgenic plants were higher than WT. Overexpressing EdVP1 significantly improved yield and KUE of transgenic wheat and was related to higher K uptake capacity in root."

Transcriptome analysis identified 364 up-regulated and 68 down-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in DIECA-treated leaves compared with water-treated leaves. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the DEGs revealed important GO terms and pathways, in particular, response to growth hormones, activity of glutathione metabolism (e.g., glutathione transferase activity), oxalate oxidase, and chitinase activity. Gene annotaion revealedÂ that some pathogenesis-related ( PR ) genes, such as PR1.1 , PR1 , PR10 , PR4a , Chitinase 8 , beta-1,3-glucanase , RPM1 , RGA2 , and HSP70, were induced by DIECA treatment. DIECA reduced JA and auxin (IAA) levels, while increased brassinosteroid, glutathione, and ROS lesions in wheat leaves, which corroborated with the transcriptional changes.

A total of 165 P. nodorum isolates were collected from three wheat growing regions in Norway from 2015 to 2017. These isolates, as well as nine isolates from other countries, were analyzed for genetic variation using 20 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Genetic analysis of the isolate collection indicated that the P. nodorum pathogen population infecting Norwegian spring and winter wheat underwent regular sexual reproduction and exhibited a high level of genetic diversity, with no genetic subdivisions between sampled locations, years or host cultivars. A high frequency of the presence of necrotrophic effector (NE) gene SnToxA was found in Norwegian P. nodorum isolates compared to other parts of Europe, and we hypothesize that the SnToxA gene is the major virulence factor among the three known P. nodorum NE genes ( SnToxA , SnTox1 , and SnTox3 ) in the Norwegian pathogen population. While the importance of SNB has declined in much of Europe, Norway has remained as a P. nodorum hotspot, likely due at least in part to local adaptation of the pathogen population to ToxA sensitive Norwegian spring wheat cultivars."

"30823586","abstracttext","Wheat, a major worldwide staple food crop, is relatively sensitive to a changing environment, including high temperature. The comprehensive mechanism of heat stress response at the molecular level and exploitation of candidate tolerant genes are far from enough. Using transcriptome data, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of wheat under heat stress. A total of 1705 and 17 commonly differential expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in wheat grain and flag leaf, respectively, through transcriptome analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment were also applied to illustrate the functions and metabolic pathways of DEGs involved in thermotolerance of wheat grain and flag leaf. Furthermore, our data suggest that there may be a more complex molecular mechanism or tighter regulatory network in flag leaf than in grain under heat stress over time, as less commonly DEGs, more discrete expression profiles of genes (principle component analysis) and less similar pathway response were observed in flag leaf. In addition, we found that transcriptional regulation of zeatin, brassinosteroid and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways may play an important role in wheat's heat tolerance. The expression changes of some genes were validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and three potential genes involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis process were identified."

By using wheat exome capture data and a large population of 2480 segregating plants (4960 gametes), we mapped within a 0.24-cM region [332 kb in International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) RefSeq version 1.0] on chromosome arm 1BL. This region overlaps with current maps of the adult-plant resistance gene , which has remained effective for more than 60 yr. An allelism test failed to find recombination between and and yielded similar resistance phenotypes for the two loci. These results, together with similar haplotypes in the candidate region, suggested that and might represent the same gene. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of tightly linked but different genes because most of the 13 genes in the candidate region are annotated with functions associated with disease resistance. To evaluate their potential as candidate genes, we characterized their polymorphisms between resistant and susceptible haplotypes. Finally, we used these polymorphisms to develop high-throughput markers to accelerate the deployment of these resistance loci in wheat breeding programs."

"30743428","abstracttext","Common bunt, caused by the seedborne and soilborne pathogens Tilletia caries and T. laevis, has re-emerged as a major disease in organic wheat. In conventional agriculture, common bunt is routinely managed with the use of synthetic chemical seed treatments. For this reason, common bunt is a relatively unimportant disease in conventional agriculture. However, since synthetic chemical inputs are prohibited in organic agriculture, common bunt is a major threat once more in organic wheat and seed production. The challenge today is to manage the disease without the use of chemical seed treatments. This review reports on the management of common bunt under organic farming systems, mainly through host resistance and organic seed treatments. We report the history of screening wheat germplasm for bunt resistance, the search for new sources of resistance, and identification and mapping of bunt resistance genes. Since the pathogen has a gene-for-gene relationship with the host, this review also includes a summary of work on pathogen race identification and virulence patterns of field isolates. Also included are studies on the physiological and molecular basis of host resistance. Alternative seed treatments are discussed, including physical seed treatments, and microbial-based and plant-based treatments acceptable in organic systems. The article concludes with a brief discussion on the current gaps in research on the management of common bunt in organic wheat."

To identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to stripe rust resistance, we developed a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population from a cross between QN142 and susceptible cultivar Avocet S. The parents and 165 F 6 RILs were evaluated in terms of their stripe rust infection type and disease severity in replicated field tests with six site-year environments. The parents and RILs were genotyped with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Four stable QTLs were identified in QN142 and mapped to chromosome arms 1BL, 2AL, 2BL, and 6BS. The 1BL QTL was probably the known resistance gene Yr29, the 2BL QTL was in a resistance gene-rich region, and the 2AL and 6BS QTLs might be new. Kompetitive allele specific polymerase chain reaction markers developed from the SNP markers flanking these QTLs were highly polymorphic in a panel of 150 wheat cultivars and breeding lines. These markers could be used in marker-assisted selection for incorporating the stripe rust resistance QTL into new wheat cultivars."

China is one of the largest stripe rust epidemic regions in the world. The pathogen sexual reproduction and migration routes between Tibet and the other regions in China are still unknown. In this study, we obtained 961 Pst isolates from 1,391 wheat leaf samples from Gansu (277), Shaanxi (253), Sichuan (172), and Tibet (259), comprising 13 natural populations, and genotyped them with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The isolates can be divided into two distinct clusters based on DAPC and STRUCTURE analyses. The genetic diversity of Longnan (in Gansu) and Yibin (in Sichuan) populations was the highest and lowest among the 13 populations, respectively. The hypothesis of multilocus linkage disequilibrium was rejected for the populations from Linzhi in the Himalayan, Longnan, Hanzhong, Guangyuan, Mianyang, Liangshan, and Chendu in the south Qinling Mountains at the level of P = 0.01, which indicated significant linkage among markers in these populations. Populations in the other regions had extensive gene exchange (N m > 4); little gene exchange was found between Tibet and the other regions (N m < 1). The results suggest that the Tibet epidemic region of Pst is highly differentiated from the other epidemic regions in China."

"31804478","abstracttext","Chloroplasts are important for photosynthesis and for plant immunity against microbial pathogens. Here we identify a haustorium-specific protein (Pst_12806) from the wheat stripe rust fungus, Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), that is translocated into chloroplasts and affects chloroplast function. Transient expression of Pst_12806 inhibits BAX-induced cell death in tobacco plants and reduces Pseudomonas-induced hypersensitive response in wheat. It suppresses plant basal immunity by reducing callose deposition and the expression of defense-related genes. Pst_12806 is upregulated during infection, and its knockdown (by host-induced gene silencing) reduces Pst growth and development, likely due to increased ROS accumulation. Pst_12806 interacts with the C-terminal Rieske domain of the wheat TaISP protein (a putative component of the cytochrome b6-f complex). Expression of Pst_12806 in plants reduces electron transport rate, photosynthesis, and production of chloroplast-derived ROS. Silencing TaISP by virus-induced gene silencing in a susceptible wheat cultivar reduces fungal growth and uredinium development, suggesting an increase in resistance against Pst infection."

However, little information is known regarding the molecular mechanisms associated with the regulation of these traits by Q, especially for the structural determination of threshability. Here, transcriptome analysis of immature spike tissues in three lines nearly isogenic for Q revealed over 3000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in a number of pathways. Using phenotypic, microscopic, transcriptomic, and tissue-specific gene expression analyses, we demonstrated that Q governs threshability through extensive modification of wheat glumes including their structure, cell wall thickness, and chemical composition. Critical DEGs and pathways involved in secondary cell wall synthesis and regulation of the chemical composition of glumes were identified. We also showed that the mutation giving rise to the Q allele synchronized the expression of genes for micro-sporogenesis that affected pollen fertility, and may determine the final grain number for wheat spikes. Transcriptome dissection of genes and genetic pathways regulated by Q should further our understanding of wheat domestication and improvement."

"31479901","abstracttext","Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and di(n-butyl) phthalate (DBP) are the major phthalic acid esters to be used during the plastic manufacturing process; they have emerged as pollutants that result in serious environmental problems. However, their impacts on wheat at the reproductive stage remain unclear. Here, we examined the distribution of DEHP and DBP and their respective metabolites mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP) in mature wheat, along with the mechanism of detoxification and oxidative burst in wheat grains under DBP and DEHP stress conditions in a pot experiment. High-performance liquid chromatography showed that the contents of DBP and DEHP, as well as their metabolites, i.e., MBP and MEHP, presented the highest values in the grain, followed by the stem, leaf, and root. Entry of DBP and DEHP into the grain from the soil induced the production of reactive oxygen species, accompanied by the upregulated expression and activity of the antioxidant enzymes (e.g., cytochrome P4503A4 and peroxidase). The metacaspase type I gene was also upregulated in response to DBP and DEHP stress in grains, which is indicative of programmed cell death to maintain normal physiological activities and to resist cell damage. DBP and DEHP stress-damaged cells in the grains underwent programmed cell death by upregulating the expression levels of the metacaspase type I gene. These results provide a new perspective for improving wheat tolerance to DBP and DEHP through the use of genetic engineering strategies."

"31297725","abstracttext_key message","Here, a functional characterization of a wheat MSR has been presented: this protein makes a contribution to the plant's tolerance of abiotic stress, acting through its catalytic capacity and its modulation of ROS and ABA pathways. The molecular mechanism and function of certain members of the methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSR) gene family have been defined, however, these analyses have not included the wheat equivalents. The wheat MSR gene TaMSRA4.1 is inducible by salinity and drought stress and in this study, we demonstrate that its activity is restricted to the Met-S-SO enantiomer, and its subcellular localization is in the chloroplast. Furthermore, constitutive expression of TaMSRA4.1 enhanced the salinity and drought tolerance of wheat and Arabidopsis thaliana. In these plants constitutively expressing TaMSRA4.1, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was found to be influenced through the modulation of genes encoding proteins involved in ROS signaling, generation and scavenging, while the level of endogenous abscisic acid (ABA), and the sensitivity of stomatal guard cells to exogenous ABA, was increased. A yeast two-hybrid screen, bimolecular fluorescence complementation and co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that heme oxygenase 1 (HO1) interacted with TaMSRA4.1, and that this interaction depended on a TaHO1 C-terminal domain. In plants subjected to salinity or drought stress, TaMSRA4.1 reversed the oxidation of TaHO1, activating ROS and ABA signaling pathways, but not in the absence of HO1. The aforementioned properties advocate TaMSRA4.1 as a candidate for plant genetic enhancement."

"31323925","abstracttext","The Tunisian durum wheat germplasm includes modern cultivars and traditional varieties that are still cultivated in areas where elite cultivars or intensive cultivation systems are not suitable. Within the frame of a collection program of the National Gene Bank of Tunisia (NGBT), durum wheat germplasm was collected from different Tunisian agro-ecological zones. The collected samples were studied using simple sequence repeats (SSRs) markers to explore the genetic diversity and evaluate the genetic structure in Tunisian germplasm. The results demonstrated significant diversity in the Tunisian durum wheat germplasm, with clear differentiation between traditional varieties and modern cultivars. The population structure analysis allowed the identification of five subpopulations, two of which appear to be more strongly represented in germplasm collected in central and southern Tunisia, where environmental conditions at critical development phases of the plant are harsher. Moreover these subpopulations are underrepresented in modern varieties, suggesting that traits of adaptation useful for breeding more resilient varieties might be present in central and southern germplasm. Moreover, our results will support, the activity of in situ on farm conservation of Tunisian durum wheat germplasm started by the National Gene Bank of Tunisia along with the ex situ approach."

A dual luciferase reporter assay indicated that TaWRKY40 improved the TaGAPC1 promoter activity. The results of qRT-PCR in wheat protoplast cells with instantaneous overexpression of TaWRKY40 indicated that the expression level of TaGAPC1 induced by abiotic stress was upregulated by TaWRKY40.

"32884737","abstracttext","The rapid development of transcriptome sequencing technology has contributed to the discovery of numerous genes in plant; however, the role of gene expression in postharvest wheat remains largely unexplored. In this study, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by RNA-seq in different quality wheats. The 102.6Â Gb clean reads had been yielded from the nine RNA-seq libraries. Typically, there were 1791 upregulated and 2,677 downregulated DEGs, respectively, in strong-gluten wheat compared with weak-gluten wheat. Specifically, a total of 4,468 DEGs were classified into 286 Gene Ontology (GO) terms and 131 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes terms (KEGG). Moreover, the storage protein components, starch and sucrose metabolism, and plant hormone signal transduction-related genes were discovered, which had involved 109 DEGs. The wet gluten proteins content was 35.24% and 17.36%, and the glutenin macropolymer content was 6.38% and 5.01% between the strong- and weak-gluten wheat, respectively. The POD activities of the different quality wheats were 6,571.14, 5,341.24, and 4,851.48 U/g/min, respectively. The significant difference of starch and sucrose metabolism, hormone, POD, and CAT enzyme along with the higher ATPase activity might potentially affect gluten polymerization, which might thereby result in the different qualities of wheats."

"32900433","abstracttext","Flowering time is an important agronomic trait that greatly influences plant architecture and grain yield in cereal crops. The present study identified a light-regulated gene, TaLWD1L-A, from hexaploid wheat that encodes a WD40 domain-containing protein. TaLWD1L-A was localized in the nucleus. Phenotypic analysis demonstrated that TaLWD1L-A overexpression in transgenic wheat led to an obvious early flowering phenotype. Upregulation of the floral activator gene TaFT1 caused the early flowering phenotype in transgenic wheat plants. TaLWD1L-A also affected the expression of circadian clock genes, including TaTOC1, TaLHY, TaPRR59, TaPRR73 and TaPRR95, and indirectly regulated the expression of the TaFT1 in transgenic plants by affecting the expression of vernalization-related genes TaVRN1 and TaVRN2 and photoperiod-related genes TaPpd-1 and TaGI. The early flowering phenotype in TaLWD1L-A-overexpressing transgenic lines led to a relatively shorter phenotype and yield reduction. Our results revealed that TaLWD1L-A affected the expression of circadian clock-related genes and played an important role in wheat flowering regulation by influencing the expression of genes related to vernalization and photoperiod pathways."
"32587597","articletitle","A Streamlined Protocol for Wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) Protoplast Isolation and Transformation With CRISPR-Cas Ribonucleoprotein Complexes."
"32587597","abstracttext","The genetic engineering method CRISPR has been touted as an efficient, inexpensive, easily used, and targeted genetic modification technology that is widely suggested as having the potential to solve many of the problems facing agriculture now and in the future. Like all new technologies, however, it is not without challenges. One of the most difficult challenges to anticipate and detect is gene targets that are inaccessible due to the chromatin state at their specific location. There is currently no way to predict this during the process of designing a sgRNA target, and the only way to detect this issue before spending time and resources on full transformations is to test the cleavage ability of the sgRNA in vivo . In wheat, this is possible using protoplast isolation and PEG transformation with Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes. Therefore, we have developed a streamlined protocol for testing the accessibility of sgRNA targets in wheat. The first steps involve digesting wheat leaf tissue in an enzymatic solution and then isolating viable protoplasts using filters and a sucrose gradient. The protoplasts are then transformed using Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes via PEG-mediated transformation. DNA is isolated from the CRISPR-Cas-edited protoplasts and PCR is performed to amplify the gene target region. The PCR product is then used to assess the editing efficiency of the chosen sgRNA using Sanger sequencing. This simplified protocol for the isolation and transformation of wheat protoplast cells using Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes streamlines CRISPR transformation projects by allowing for a fast and easy test of sgRNA accessibility in vivo ."

"18049798","abstracttext","The hardness or texture of cereal grains is a primary determinant of their technological and processing quality. Among members of the Triticeae, most notably wheat, much of the variation in texture is controlled by a single locus comprised of the Puroindoline a, Puroindoline b and Grain Softness Protein-1 (Gsp-1) genes. Puroindolines confer the three major texture classes of soft and hard common wheat and the very hard durum wheat. The protein products of these genes interact with lipids and are associated with the surface of isolated starch (as a protein fraction known as 'friabilin'). During the past ten years a great diversity of alleles of both Puroindoline genes have been discovered and significant advances made in understanding the relationship between the gene presence/absence, sequence polymorphism and texture of cereal grains. Efforts have also focussed on Puroindoline and Gsp-1 genes in diploid progenitors, other Triticeae grasses and synthetic wheats in order to understand the evolution of this gene family and find potentially useful variants. The puroindoline homologues in other cereals such as rye and barley are also receiving attention. This work summarises new developments in molecular genetics of puroindolines in wheat and related Triticeae grasses, and the related genes in other cereals."
"18326864","articletitle","Development of abiotic stress tolerance via bZIP-type transcription factor LIP19 in common wheat."
"18326864","abstracttext","Cereal lip19 genes encoding bZIP-type transcription factors are assumed to play a regulatory role in gene expression during the cold acclimation process. However, no direct evidence shows an association of LIP19-type bZIPs with stress tolerance or activation of stress-responsive Cor/Lea genes. To understand the molecular basis of development of abiotic stress tolerance through the LIP19 transcription factor, a wheat lip19 homologue, Wlip19, was isolated and characterized. Wlip19 expression was activated by low temperature in seedlings and was higher in a freezing-tolerant cultivar than in a freezing-sensitive one. Wlip19 also responded to drought and exogenous ABA treatment. Wlip19-expressing transgenic tobacco showed a significant increase in abiotic stress tolerance, especially freezing tolerance. Expression of a GUS reporter gene under the control of promoter sequences of four wheat Cor/Lea genes, Wdhn13, Wrab17, Wrab18, and Wrab19, was enhanced by Wlip19 expression in wheat callus and tobacco plants. These results indicate that WLIP19 acts as a transcriptional regulator of Cor/Lea genes in the development of abiotic stress tolerance. Moreover, direct protein-protein interaction between WLIP19 and a wheat OBF1 homologue TaOBF1, another bZIP-type transcription factor, was observed, suggesting that this interaction is conserved in cereals."

Here, we briefly review the current status of homoeologous recombination-based chromosome engineering research in plants with a focus on wheat, and demonstrate that integrated use of cytogenetic stocks and molecular resources can enhance the efficiency and precision of homoeologus-based chromosome engineering. We report the results of an experiment on homoeologous recombination-based transfer of virus resistance from an alien chromosome to a wheat chromosome, its characterization, and the prospects for further engineering by a second round of recombination. A proposal is presented for genome-wide, homoeologous recombination-based engineering for efficient mining of gene pools of wild relatives for crop improvement."

In this study, we performed a bioinformatics analysis to identify WRKY TFs with full-length CDSs from the A. tauschii genome. A detailed evolutionary analysis for all these TFs was conducted, and quantitative real-time PCR was carried out to investigate the expression patterns of the abiotic stress-related WRKY TFs under different abiotic stress conditions in A. tauschii seedlings. A total of 93 WRKY TFs were identified from A. tauschii, and 79 of them were found to be newly discovered genes compared with wheat. Gene phylogeny, gene structure and chromosome location of the 93 WRKY TFs were fully analyzed. These studies provide a global view of the WRKY TFs from A. tauschii and a firm foundation for further investigations in both A. tauschii and wheat."

"16391696","abstracttext","The vernalization gene VRN-1 has been identified as a MADS-box transcription factor orthologous to the meristem identity gene APETALA1 (AP1). A single copy of this gene was found in diploid wheat, but 2 copies were reported in barley. In this study, we present a detailed characterization of these 2 copies to understand their respective roles in the vernalization response. We identified 2 groups of barley bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), each containing 1 AP1 copy designated hereafter as HvAP1a and HvAP1b. A physical map of the VRN-H1 region showed that the HvAP1a BACs were part of the VRN-H1 region but that the HvAP1b BACs were not. Numerous structural changes were observed between the barley and wheat VRN-1 physical maps. In a population segregating for VRN-H1, the HvAP1a gene cosegregated with growth habit, suggesting that HvAP1a is the barley vernalization gene VRN-H1. The other copy, HvAP1b, was mapped on the centromeric region of chromosome 1H, the chromosome where vernalization gene VRN-H3 was previously mapped. We developed a mapping population segregating for VRN-H3 and showed that 2 molecular makers flanking HvAP1b locus were not linked to growth habit. The HvAP1b copy has a complete deletion of the first 2 exons, suggesting that it is a truncated pseudogene and not a candidate for VRN-H3. In summary, this study contributed a detailed physical map of the barley VRN-H1 region, showed several structural differences with the orthologous wheat region, and clarified the identity of the barley VRN-H1 gene."

"20198466","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most important diseases of wheat worldwide. The best strategy to control stripe rust is to grow resistant cultivars. One such cultivar resistant to most races in North America is 'IDO377s'. To study the genetics of its resistance this spring wheat cultivar was crossed with 'Avocet Susceptible' (AvS). Seedlings of the parents, F(2) plants, and F(3) lines were tested under controlled greenhouse conditions with races PST-43 and PST-45 of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici. IDO377s carries a single dominant gene for resistance. Resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) techniques were used to identify molecular markers linked to the resistance gene. A total of ten markers were identified, two of which flanked the locus at 4.4 and 5.5 cM. These flanking RGAP markers were located on chromosome 2B with nulli-tetrasomic lines of 'Chinese Spring'. Their presence in the ditelosomic 2BL line localized them to the long arm. The chromosomal location of the resistance gene was further confirmed with two 2BL-specific SSR markers and a sequence tagged site (STS) marker previously mapped to 2BL. Based on the chromosomal location, reactions to various races of the pathogen and tests of allelism, the IDO377s gene is different from all previously designated genes for stripe rust resistance, and is therefore designated Yr43. A total of 108 wheat breeding lines and cultivars with IDO377s or related cultivars in their parentage were assayed to assess the status of the closest flanking markers and to select lines carrying Yr43. The results showed that the flanking markers were reliable for assisting selection of breeding lines carrying the resistance gene. A linked stripe rust resistance gene, previously identified as YrZak, in cultivar Zak was designated Yr44."

"23800119","abstracttext_results","Gene sets affected by Hessian fly attack in resistant plants were found to be very different from those in susceptible plants. Differential expression of gene sets was associated with differential accumulation of intermediates in defense pathways. Our results indicated that resources were rapidly mobilized in resistant plants for defense, including extensive membrane remodeling and release of lipids, sugar catabolism, and amino acid transport and degradation. These resources were likely rapidly converted into defense molecules such as oxylipins; toxic proteins including cysteine proteases, inhibitors of digestive enzymes, and lectins; phenolics; and cell wall components. However, toxicity alone does not cause immediate lethality to Hessian fly larvae. Toxic defenses might slow down Hessian fly development and therefore give plants more time for other types of defense to become effective."
"23800119","abstracttext_conclusion","Our gene expression and metabolic profiling results suggested that remodeling and fortification of cell wall and cuticle by increased deposition of phenolics and enhanced cross-linking were likely to be crucial for insect mortality by depriving Hessian fly larvae of nutrients from host cells. The identification of a large number of genes that were differentially expressed at different time points during compatible and incompatible interactions also provided a foundation for further research on the molecular pathways that lead to wheat resistance and susceptibility to Hessian fly infestation."

A new leaf rust resistance gene tentatively named LrM was introgressed from the diploid non-progenitor species Ae. markgrafii (2nâ=â2xâ=â14, genome CC) into common wheat using the nulli-5B mechanism. The introgression line ER9-700 showed a high degree of resistance against a wide spectrum of Puccinia triticina pathotypes. Genetic analysis was performed using the F 1 , F 2 , F 2:3 and BC 1 F 1 generations derived from the cross ER9-700/Agra Local. The results showed a single dominant gene for leaf rust resistance. The resistance gene LrM was mapped on chromosome arm 2AS using SSR- and SNP-based PCR markers. Preliminary mapping with SSR markers in the F 2:3 population from the cross ER9-700/Agra Local identified two SSR markers flanking the LrM. SNPs were identified in the genomic region flanked by SSR markers, and SNP-based PCR markers were developed to construct the final map. Three SNP-based PCR markers co-segregated and mapped closest to the resistance gene at a distance of 2Â cM. The gene LrM was distinguished from all the other genes designated and mapped on chromosome arm 2AS by molecular markers and rust reaction. All five markers used in the mapping amplified identical alleles in the donor Ae. markgrafii accession and introgression line ER9-700. The chromosomal location and rust reaction suggest that LrM is a novel leaf rust resistance gene that may be useful in broadening the genetic base of leaf rust resistance in wheat."

"30335145","abstracttext","The wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus, is a major pest of wheat and key ecological player in the grasslands of western North America. It also represents the distinctive Cephoidea superfamily of sawflies (Symphyta) that appeared early during the hymenopteran radiation, but after three early-branching eusymphytan superfamilies that form the base of the order Hymenoptera. We present a high-quality draft genome assembly of 162Â Mb in 1,976 scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 622Â kb. Automated gene annotation identified 11,210 protein-coding gene models and 1,307 noncoding RNA models. Thirteen percent of the assembly consists of â¼58,000 transposable elements partitioned equally between Class-I and Class-II elements. Orthology analysis reveals that 86% of Cephus proteins have identifiable orthologs in other insects. Phylogenomic analysis of conserved subsets of these proteins supports the placement of the Cephoidea between the Eusymphyta and the parasitic woodwasp superfamily Orussoidea. Manual annotation and phylogenetic analysis of families of odorant, gustatory, and ionotropic receptors, plus odorant-binding proteins, shows that Cephus has representatives for most conserved and expanded gene lineages in the Apocrita (wasps, ants, and bees). Cephus has also maintained several insect gene lineages that have been lost from the Apocrita, most prominently the carbon dioxide receptor subfamily. Furthermore, Cephus encodes a few small lineage-specific chemoreceptor gene family expansions that might be involved in adaptations to new grasses including wheat. These comparative analyses identify gene family members likely to have been present in the hymenopteran ancestor and provide a new perspective on the evolution of the chemosensory gene repertoire."
"25429295","articletitle","Conserved cis-regulatory modules in promoters of genes encoding wheat high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits."
"25429295","abstracttext","The concentration and composition of the gliadin and glutenin seed storage proteins (SSPs) in wheat flour are the most important determinants of its end-use value. In cereals, the synthesis of SSPs is predominantly regulated at the transcriptional level by a complex network involving at least five cis-elements in gene promoters. The high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) are encoded by two tightly linked genes located on the long arms of group 1 chromosomes. Here, we sequenced and annotated the HMW-GS gene promoters of 22 electrophoretic wheat alleles to identify putative cis-regulatory motifs. We focused on 24 motifs known to be involved in SSP gene regulation. Most of them were identified in at least one HMW-GS gene promoter sequence. A common regulatory framework was observed in all the HMW-GS gene promoters, as they shared conserved cis-regulatory modules (CCRMs) including all the five motifs known to regulate the transcription of SSP genes. This common regulatory framework comprises a composite box made of the GATA motifs and GCN4-like Motifs (GLMs) and was shown to be functional as the GLMs are able to bind a bZIP transcriptional factor SPA (Storage Protein Activator). In addition to this regulatory framework, each HMW-GS gene promoter had additional motifs organized differently. The promoters of most highly expressed x-type HMW-GS genes contain an additional box predicted to bind R2R3-MYB transcriptional factors. However, the differences in annotation between promoter alleles could not be related to their level of expression. In summary, we identified a common modular organization of HMW-GS gene promoters but the lack of correlation between the cis-motifs of each HMW-GS gene promoter and their level of expression suggests that other cis-elements or other mechanisms regulate HMW-GS gene expression."

"12175069","abstracttext","Gliadins are the most abundant component of the seed storage proteins in cereals and, in combination with glutenins, are important for the bread-making quality of wheat. They are divided into four subfamilies, the alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and omega-gliadins, depending on their electrophoresis pattern, chromosomal location, and DNA and protein structures. Using a PCR-based strategy we isolated and sequenced an omega-gliadin sequence. We also determined the chromosomal subarm location of this sequence using wheat aneuploids and deletion lines. The gene is 1858 bp long and contains a coding sequence 1248 bp in length. Like all other gliadin gene families characterized in cereals, the omega-gliadin gene described here had characteristic features including two repeated sequences 300 bp upstream of the start codon. At the DNA level, the gene had a high degree of similarity to the omega-secalin and C-hordein genes of rye and barley, but exhibited much less homology to the alpha- and beta-gliadin gene families. In terms of the deduced amino acid sequence, this gene has about 80 and 70% similarity to the omega-secalin and C-hordein genes, respectively, and possesses all the features reported for other gliadin gene families. The omega-gliadin gene has about 30 repeats of the core consensus sequences PQQPX and XQQPQQX, twice as many as other gliadin gene families. Southern blotting and PCR analysis with aneuploid and deletion lines for the short arm of chromosome 1A showed that the omega-gliadin was located on the distal 25% of the short arm of chromosome 1A. By comparison of PCR and A-PAGE profiles for deletion stocks, its genomic location must be at a different locus from gli-Ala in 'Chinese Spring'."

"17611798","abstracttext","In hexaploid wheat, leaf rust resistance gene Lr1 is located at the distal end of the long arm of chromosome 5D. To clone this gene, an F(1)-derived doubled haploid population and a recombinant inbred line population from a cross between the susceptible cultivar AC Karma and the resistant line 87E03-S2B1 were phenotyped for resistance to Puccinia triticina race 1-1 BBB that carries the avirulence gene Avr1. A high-resolution genetic map of the Lr1 locus was constructed using microsatellite, resistance gene analog (RGA), BAC end (BE), and low pass (LP) markers. A physical map of the locus was constructed by screening a hexaploid wheat BAC library from cultivar Glenlea that is known to have Lr1. The locus comprised three RGAs from a gene family related to RFLP marker Xpsr567. Markers specific to each paralog were developed. Lr1 segregated with RGA567-5 while recombinants were observed for the other two RGAs. Transformation of the susceptible cultivar Fielder with RGA567-5 demonstrated that it corresponds to the Lr1 resistance gene. In addition, the candidate gene was also confirmed by virus-induced gene silencing. Twenty T (1) lines from resistant transgenic line T (0)-938 segregated for resistance, partial resistance and susceptibility to Avr1 corresponding to a 1:2:1 ratio for a single hemizygous insertion. Transgene presence and expression correlated with the phenotype. The resistance phenotype expressed by Lr1 seemed therefore to be dependant on the zygosity status. T (3)-938 sister lines with and without the transgene were further tested with 16 virulent and avirulent rust isolates. Rust reactions were all as expected for Lr1 thereby providing additional evidence toward the Lr1 identity of RGA567-5. Sequence analysis of Lr1 indicated that it is not related to the previously isolated Lr10 and Lr21 genes and unlike these genes, it is part of a large gene family."

"15753592","abstracttext","Hexaploid wheat is a species that has been subjected to most extensive cytogenetic studies. This has contributed to understanding the mechanism of the evolution of polyploids involving diploidization through genetic restriction of chromosome pairing to only homologous chromosomes. The availability of a variety of aneuploids and the ph mutants (Ph1 and Ph2) in bread wheat also allowed chromosome manipulations leading to the development of alien addition/substitution lines and the introgression of alien chromosome segments into the wheat genome. More recently in the genomics era, molecular tools have been used extensively not only for the construction of molecular maps, but also for identification/isolation of genes/QTLs (including epistatic QTLs, eQTLs and PQLs) for several agronomic traits. It has also been possible to identify gene-rich regions and recombination hot spots in the wheat genome, which are now being subjected to sequencing at the genome level, through development of BAC libraries. In the EST database also, among all plants wheat ESTs are the highest in number, and are only next to those for human, mouse, Ciona intestinalis (a chordate), rat and zebrafish genomes. These ESTs and sequences of several genomic regions have been subjected to a variety of applications including development of perfect markers and establishment of microcollinearity. The technique of in situ hybridization (including FISH, GISH and McFISH) and the development of deletion stocks also facilitated the preparation of physical maps. Molecular markers are also used for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding programs in several countries. Construction of a wheat DNA chip, which will also become available soon, may further facilitate wheat genomics research. These enormous resources, knowledge base and the fast development of additional molecular tools and high throughput approaches for genotyping will prove extremely useful in future wheat research and will lead to development of improved wheat cultivars."

"19995415","abstracttext_background","Wheat stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat worldwide. To establish compatibility with the host, Pst forms special infection structures to invade the plant with minimal damage to host cells. Although compatible interaction between wheat and Pst has been studied using various approaches, research on molecular mechanisms of the interaction is limited. The aim of this study was to develop an EST database of wheat infected by Pst in order to determine transcription profiles of genes involved in compatible wheat-Pst interaction."
"19995415","abstracttext_results","Total RNA, extracted from susceptible infected wheat leaves harvested at 3, 5 and 8 days post inoculation (dpi), was used to create a cDNA library, from which 5,793 ESTs with high quality were obtained and clustered into 583 contigs and 2,160 singletons to give a set of 2,743 unisequences (GenBank accessions: GR302385 to GR305127). The BLASTx program was used to search for homologous genes of the unisequences in the GenBank non-redundant protein database. Of the 2,743 unisequences, 52.8% (the largest category) were highly homologous to plant genes; 16.3% to fungal genes and 30% of no-hit. The functional classification of all ESTs was established based on the database entry giving the best E-value using the Bevan's classification categories. About 50% of the ESTs were significantly homologous to genes encoding proteins with known functions; 20% were similar to genes encoding proteins with unknown functions and 30% did not have significant homology to any sequence in the database. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis determined the transcription profiles and their involvement in the wheat-Pst interaction for seven of the gene."
"19995415","abstracttext_conclusion","The cDNA library is useful for identifying the functional genes involved in the wheat-Pst compatible interaction, and established a new database for studying Pst pathogenesis genes and wheat defense genes. The transcription patterns of seven genes were confirmed by the qRT-PCR assay to be differentially expressed in wheat-Pst compatible and incompatible interaction."
"19727654","articletitle","Development of consistently crossable wheat genotypes for alien wheat gene transfer through fine-mapping of the Kr1 locus."
"19727654","abstracttext","Breeders can force sexual hybridisation between wheat and related grass species to produce interspecific hybrids containing a dihaploid set of wheat and related chromosomes. This facilitates the introgression of desirable genes into wheat from the secondary gene pool. However, most elite European wheat varieties carry genes that suppress crossability, making the transfer of novel traits from exotic germplasm into elite wheat varieties difficult or impossible. Previous studies have identified at least five crossability loci in wheat. Here, the crossability locus with the largest effect, Kr1 on chromosome arm 5BL, was fine-mapped by developing a series of recombinant substitution lines in which the genome of the normally non-crossable wheat variety 'Hobbit sib' carries a recombinant 5BL chromosome arm containing segments from the crossable variety 'Chinese Spring'. These recombinant lines were scored for their ability to cross with rye over four seasons. Analysis revealed at least two regions on 5BL affecting crossability, including the Kr1 locus. However, the ability to set seed is highly dependent on prevailing environmental conditions. Typically, even crossable wheat lines exhibit little or no seed set when crossed with rye in winter, but show up to 90% seed set from similar crosses made in summer. By recombining different combinations of the two regions affecting crossability, wheat lines that consistently exhibit up to 50% seed set, whether crossed in the UK winter or summer conditions, were generated, thus creating a very important tool for increasing the efficiency of alien wheat transfer programmes."

"21534722","abstracttext","The genetic diversity within wheat breeding programs across Turkey and Kazakhstan was compared with a selection of European cultivars that represented the genetic diversity across eight European countries and six decades of wheat breeding. To focus the measure of genetic diversity on that relevant to disease-resistant phenotypes, nucleotide-binding-site (NBS) profiling was used to detect polymorphisms associated with the NBS motifs found within the NBS--leucine-rich repeat (LRR) class of resistance (R) genes. Cereal-specific NBS primers, designed specifically to the conserved NBS motifs found within cereal R-genes, provided distinct NBS profiles. Although the genetic diversity associated with NBS motifs was only slightly higher within the Eastern wheat genotypes, the NBS profiles produced by Eastern and European wheat lines differed considerably. Structure analysis divided the wheat genotypes into four groups, which compared well with the origin of the wheat genotypes. The highest levels of genetic diversity were seen for the wheat genotypes from the Genetic Resource Collection held in Ankara, Turkey, as wheat genotypes within breeding programs were genetically more similar. The wheat genotypes from Kazakhstan were the most similar to the European cultivars, reflecting the significant number of eastern European cultivars used in the breeding program in Kazakhstan. In general, the NBS profiles suggested that NBS-LRR R-gene usage in winter wheat breeding in Turkey and Kazakhstan differed from that deployed in European cultivars."
"21739140","articletitle","Chromosome 5H of Hordeum species involved in reduction in grain hardness in wheat genetic background."
"21739140","abstracttext","Grain hardness is an important factor affecting end-use quality in wheat. Mutations of the puroindoline genes, which are located on chromosome 5DS, control a majority of grain texture variations. Hordoindoline genes, which are the puroindoline gene homologs in barley, are located on chromosome 5HS and are also responsible for grain texture variation. In this study, we used three types of wheat-barley species (Hordeum vulgare, H. vulgare ssp. spontaneum, and H. chilense) chromosome addition lines and studied the effect of chromosome 5H of these species on wheat grain characteristics. The 5H chromosome addition lines showed significantly lower grain hardness and higher grain weight than the corresponding wheat parents. The effect of enhancing grain softness was largest in the wheat-H. chilense line regardless of having an increase in grain weight similar to those in the wheat-H. vulgare and wheat-H. spontaneum lines. Our results indicated that chromosome 5H of the Hordeum species plays a role in enhancing grain softness and increasing grain weight in the wheat genetic background, and the extent of effect on grain hardness depends on the type of Hordeum species. Protein analysis of hordoindolines indicated that profiles of 2D-electrophoresis of hordoindolines were different among Hordeum species and hordoindolines in the addition lines appeared to be most abundant in wheat-H. chilense line. The differences in enhancing grain softness among the Hordeum species might be attributed to the quantity of hordoindolines expressed in the 5H chromosome addition lines. These results suggested that the barley hordoindolines located on chromosome 5HS play a role in reducing grain hardness in the wheat genetic background."

"26406536","abstracttext","Wheat is a staple food worldwide and provides 40% of the calories in the diet. Climate change and global warming pose a threat to wheat production, however, and demand a deeper understanding of how heat stress might impact wheat production and wheat biology. However, it is difficult to identify novel heat stress associated genes when the genomic information is not available. Wheat has a very large and complex genome that is about 37 times the size of the rice genome. The present study sequenced the whole transcriptome of the wheat cv. HD2329 at the flowering stage, under control (22Â°Â±3Â°C) and heat stress (42Â°C, 2âh) conditions using Illumina HiSeq and Roche GS-FLX 454 platforms. We assembled more than 26.3 and 25.6 million high-quality reads from the control and HS-treated tissues transcriptome sequences respectively. About 76,556 (control) and 54,033 (HS-treated) contigs were assembled and annotated de novo using different assemblers and a total of 21,529 unigenes were obtained. Gene expression profile showed significant differential expression of 1525 transcripts under heat stress, of which 27 transcripts showed very high (>10) fold upregulation. Cellular processes such as metabolic processes, protein phosphorylation, oxidations-reductions, among others were highly influenced by heat stress. In summary, these observations significantly enrich the transcript dataset of wheat available on public domain and show a de novo approach to discover the heat-responsive transcripts of wheat, which can accelerate the progress of wheat stress-genomics as well as the course of wheat breeding programs in the era of climate change."
"27112150","articletitle","Development and characterization of a spring hexaploid wheat line with no functional VRN2 genes."
"27112150","abstracttext_key message","The combination of three non-functional alleles of the flowering repressor VRN2 results in a spring growth habit in wheat. In temperate cereals with a winter growth habit, a prolonged exposure to low temperatures (vernalization) accelerates flowering. Before vernalization, the VRN2 locus plays a central role in maintaining flowering repression. Non-functional VRN2 alleles result in spring growth habit and are frequent in diploid wheat and barley. However, in hexaploid wheat, the effect of these non-functional VRN2 alleles is masked by gene redundancy. In this study, we developed a triple VRN2 mutant (synthetic vrn2-null) in hexaploid wheat by combining the non-functional VRN-A2 allele present in most polyploid wheats with a VRN-B2 deletion from tetraploid wheat, and a non-functional VRN-D2 allele from Aegilops tauschii (Ae. tauschii) (the donor of hexaploid wheat D genome). Non-vernalized vrn2-null plants flowered 118Â days (PÂ <Â 2.8E-07) earlier than the winter control, and showed a limited vernalization response. The functional VRN-B2 allele is expressed at higher levels than the functional VRN-D2 allele and showed a stronger repressive effect under partial vernalization (4Â Â°C for 4Â weeks), and also in non-vernalized plants carrying only a functional VRN-B2 or VRN-D2 in heterozygous state. These results suggest that different combinations of VRN-B2 and VRN-D2 alleles can be a used to modulate the vernalization response in regions with mild winters. Spring vrn2-null mutants have been selected repeatedly in diploid wheat and barley, suggesting that they may have an adaptative value and that may be useful in hexaploid wheat. Spring wheat breeders can use these new alleles to improve wheat adaptation to different or changing environments."

"28178571","abstracttext","Small Heat Shock Proteins (sHSPs)/HSP20 are molecular chaperones that protect plants by preventing protein aggregation during abiotic stress conditions, especially heat stress. Due to global climate change, high temperature is emerging as a major threat to wheat productivity. Thus, the identification of HSP20 and analysis of HSP transcriptional regulation under different abiotic stresses in wheat would help in understanding the role of these proteins in abiotic stress tolerance. We used sequences of known rice and Arabidopsis HSP20 HMM profiles as queries against publicly available wheat genome and wheat full length cDNA databases (TriFLDB) to identify the respective orthologues from wheat. 163 TaHSP20 (including 109 sHSP and 54 ACD) genes were identified and classified according to the sub-cellular localization and phylogenetic relationship with sequenced grass genomes (Oryza sativa, Sorghum bicolor, Zea mays, Brachypodium distachyon and Setaria italica). Spatio-temporal, biotic and abiotic stress-specific expression patterns in normalized RNA seq and wheat array datasets revealed constitutive as well as inductive responses of HSP20 in different tissues and developmental stages of wheat. Promoter analysis of TaHSP20 genes showed the presence of tissue-specific, biotic, abiotic, light-responsive, circadian and cell cycle-responsive cis-regulatory elements. 14 TaHSP20 family genes were under the regulation of 8 TamiRNA genes. The expression levels of twelve HSP20 genes were studied under abiotic stress conditions in the drought- and heat-tolerant wheat genotype C306. Of the 13 TaHSP20 genes, TaHSP16.9H-CI showed high constitutive expression with upregulation only under salt stress. Both heat and salt stresses upregulated the expression of TaHSP17.4-CI, TaHSP17.7A-CI, TaHSP19.1-CIII, TaACD20.0B-CII and TaACD20.6C-CIV, while TaHSP23.7-MTI was specifically induced only under heat stress. Our results showed that the identified TaHSP20 genes play an important role under different abiotic stress conditions. Thus, the results illustrate the complexity of the TaHSP20 gene family and its stress regulation in wheat, and suggest that sHSPs as attractive breeding targets for improvement of the heat tolerance of wheat."

"28886152","abstracttext","Agropyron elongatum (Host.) Neviski (synonym, Thinopyrum ponticum Podp., 2n = 70) has been used extensively as a valuable source for wheat breeding. Numerous chromosome fragments containing valuable genes have been successfully translocated into wheat from A. elongatum. However, reports on the transfer of powdery mildew resistance from A. elongatum to wheat are rare. In this study, a novel wheat-A. elongatum translocation line, 11-20-1, developed and selected from the progenies of a sequential cross between wheat varieties (Lankaoaizaoba, Keyu 818 and BainongAK 58) and A. elongatum, was evaluated for disease resistance and characterized using molecular cytogenetic methods. Cytological observations indicated that 11-20-1 had 42 chromosomes and formed 21 bivalents at meiotic metaphase I. Genomic in situ hybridization analysis using whole genomic DNA from A. elongatum as a probe showed that the short arms of a pair of wheat chromosomes were replaced by a pair of A. elongatum chromosome arms. Fluorescence in situ hybridization, using wheat D chromosome specific sequence pAs1 as a probe, suggested that the replaced chromosome arms of 11-20-1 were 5DS. This was further confirmed by wheat SSR markers specific for 5DS. EST-SSR and EST-STS multiple loci markers confirmed that the introduced A. elongatum chromosome arms belonged to homoeologous group 5. Therefore, it was deduced that 11-20-1 was a wheat-A. elongatum T5DLâ5AgS translocation line. Both resistance observation and molecular marker analyses using two specific markers (BE443538 and CD452608) of A. elongatum in a F2 population from a cross between line 11-20-1 and a susceptible cultivar Yannong 19 verified that the A. elongatum chromosomes were responsible for the powdery mildew resistance. This work suggests that 11-20-1 likely contains a novel resistance gene against powdery mildew. We expect this line to be useful for the genetic improvement of wheat."

"29942321","abstracttext","Rapid global warming directly impacts agricultural productivity and poses a major challenge to the present-day agriculture. Recent climate change models predict severe losses in crop production worldwide due to the changing environment, and in wheat, this can be as large as 42 Mt/Â°C rise in temperature. Although wheat occupies the largest total harvested area (38.8%) among the cereals including rice and maize, its total productivity remains the lowest. The major production losses in wheat are caused more by abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, and high temperature than by biotic insults. Thus, understanding the effects of these stresses becomes indispensable for wheat improvement programs which have depended mainly on the genetic variations present in the wheat genome through conventional breeding. Notably, recent biotechnological breakthroughs in the understanding of gene functions and access to whole genome sequences have opened new avenues for crop improvement. Despite the availability of such resources in wheat, progress is still limited to the understanding of the stress signaling mechanisms using model plants such as Arabidopsis , rice and Brachypodium and not directly using wheat as the model organism. This review presents an inclusive overview of the phenotypic and physiological changes in wheat due to various abiotic stresses followed by the current state of knowledge on the identified mechanisms of perception and signal transduction in wheat. Specifically, this review provides an in-depth analysis of different hormonal interactions and signaling observed during abiotic stress signaling in wheat."

The TaGS3 genes each contained five exons and four introns, and encoded a deduced protein of 170, 169, and 169 amino acids, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of plant GS3 protein sequences revealed GS3 to be a monocotyledon-specific gene and the GS3 proteins were resolved into three classes. The length of the atypical GÎ³ domain and the cysteine-rich region was conserved within each class and not conserved between classes. A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the fifth exon (at position 1907) of TaGS3-7A leads to an amino acid change (ALA/THR) and showed different frequencies in two pools of Chinese wheat accessions representing extremes in grain weight. Association analysis indicated that the TaGS3-7A-A allele was associated with higher grain weight in the natural population. The TaGS3-7A-A allele was favoured in global modern wheat cultivars but the allelic frequency varied among different wheat-production regions of China, which indicated that this allele is of potential utility to improve wheat grain weight in certain wheat-production areas of China."

"31529399","abstracttext_main conclusion","The duplications of the dominantVrn-A1alleles as well as theVRN-B1gene, revealed for the first time, are new sources of polymorphism in polyploid wheat at these agronomically valuable genomic locations. Flowering time is an important trait in wheat breeding. In spring wheat, this feature is mainly determined by the variants and number of the homoeologous dominant VRN1 alleles. Previously, multiplication of the recessive vrn-A1 allele was shown for winter hexaploid wheat (WÃ¼rschum et al., BMC Genet 29:16-96, 2015). In the present study, VRN1 gene copy-number variation as well as the copy number of VRN-A1 with the alternative exon 4 haplotype were investigated in spring and winter accessions of different tetraploid and hexaploid wheat species. Two ratio tests were optimized based on end-point quantification of PCR fragments and results were verified by a qPCR assay. It was defined that since the genomic environment affects the accessibility of amplified VRN1 regions, the DNA template should be fragmented for proper quantification of VRN1 copy number during PCR-based assays. For the first time, it was shown that the dominant Vrn-A1 alleles are most often duplicated in hexaploid wheat. In tetraploid wheat, both the dominant and recessive alleles were represented as a single haploid copy, and in only two accessions of T. dicoccum, vrn-A1b.3 was duplicated. Multiplication of VRN-A1 was often associated with awnless spikes. Five haploid combinations of the recessive vrn-A1 copies with alternative exon 4 were identified in hexaploid wheat. Finally for the first time, duplication of VRN-B1 was found in hexaploid wheat of T. compactum and T. spelta. These results expand our knowledge of the genetic diversity of VRN1 genes in wheat and provide additional strategies for the manipulation of flowering time in this strategic crop."
"32031318","articletitle","The LATERAL ROOT DENSITY gene regulates root growth during water stress in wheat."
"32031318","abstracttext","Drought stress is the major limiting factor in agriculture. Wheat, which is the most widely grown crop in the world, is predominantly cultivated in drought-prone rainfed environments. Since roots play a critical role in water uptake, root response to water limitations is an important component for enhancing wheat adaptation. In an effort to discover novel genetic sources for improving wheat adaptation, we characterized a wheat translocation line with a chromosomal segment from Agropyron elongatum, a wild relative of wheat, which unlike common wheat maintains root growth under limited-water conditions. By exploring the root transcriptome data, we found that reduced transcript level of LATERAL ROOT DENSITY (LRD) gene under limited water in the Agropyron translocation line confers it the ability to maintain root growth. The Agropyron allele of LRD is down-regulated in response to water limitation in contrast with the wheat LRD allele, which is up-regulated by water deficit stress. Suppression of LRD expression in wheat RNAi plants confers the ability to maintain root growth under water limitation. We show that exogenous gibberellic acid (GA) promotes lateral root growth and present evidence for the role of GA in mediating the differential regulation of LRD between the common wheat and the Agropyron alleles under water stress. Suppression of LRD also had a positive pleiotropic effect on grain size and number under optimal growth conditions. Collectively, our findings suggest that LRD can be potentially useful for improving wheat response to water stress and altering yield components."

"9207838","abstracttext","Self-incompatibility is widespread in the grasses and it is proposed that the grasses share a common incompatibility mechanism that is distinct from those operating in the dicotyledonous species studied in great detail. Where good genetic data are available, all grass species appear to have an incompatibility mechanism controlled by two unlinked loci, S and Z. A putative S gene has been cloned from Phalaris coerulescens. This gene is characterized by two major domains: an allele specificity domain and a thioredoxin catalytic domain. A family of sequences with varying degrees of homology to this gene has been identified among 15 grass species covering all subfamilies of the Poaceae. These S-related sequences appear to be present in the grass family regardless of self-compatibility. Evidence is presented to show that at least one of the sequences is transcribed, suggesting a functional gene. In contrast to the high expression of the S gene in Phalaris pollen, expression of the related gene in the pollen (or anthers) of the grass species examined was so low that RNA gel blot analysis failed to display a significant signal. However, reverse transcription-based polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) successfully amplified the region corresponding to the S thioredoxin domain from 10 of the grass species. With grasses other than Phalaris, RT-PCR showed limited success in amplifying the region corresponding to the S variable portion at the 5' end of the Phalaris S gene. Sequencing of the PCR-amplified S thioredoxin region from wheat, barley, rye and Dactylis revealed that this is a highly conserved gene with 94-97% sequence similarity with the corresponding Phalaris S gene. The conservation of sequence and ubiquitous expression of the gene across the grass family strongly suggest that the S-related gene is carrying out a significant biological function in the Poaceae. On the basis of these findings, a model for the evolution of the S self-incompatibility gene in the grasses is proposed."

"16233650","abstracttext","We have cloned a novel tyrosinase-encoding gene (melB) specifically expressed in solid-state culture of Aspergillus oryzae. A tyrosinase-encoding gene (melO) from A. oryzae was already cloned and the protein structures of its catalytic and copper binding domains were investigated. However, our recent results revealed that the melO gene was highly expressed in submerged culture but not in solid-state culture. Because tyrosinase activity was also detected in solid-state culture, we assumed that another tyrosinase gene other than melO is expressed in solid-state culture. Another tyrosinase gene was screened using the expressed sequence tag (EST) library. One redundant cDNA clone homologous with the tyrosinase gene was found in the collection of wheat bran culture. Northern blot analysis revealed that the gene corresponding to the cDNA clone was specifically expressed in solid-state culture (koji making), but not in submerged culture. Molecular cloning showed that the gene carried six exons interrupted by five introns and had an open reading frame encoding 616 amino acid residues. This gene was designated as melB. The deduced amino acid sequence of the gene had weak homology (24%-33%) with MelO and other fungal tyrosinases but the sequences of the copper binding domains were highly conserved. When the melB gene was expressed under the control of the glaB promoter in solid-state culture, tyrosinase activity was markedly enhanced and the culture mass was browned with the melanization by MelB tyrosinase. These results indicated that the melB gene encodes a novel tyrosinase associated with melanization in solid-state culture."

Although the abundance of repetitive sequence may pose common problems in genome analysis and sequence assembly of large and complex genomes, they provide repeat junction markers with random and unbiased distribution throughout chromosomes.

The combined use of these two approaches allows for the process to be dissected into several finite periods of time in which the developmental stages of pairing can be precisely located. Evidence is now available, in particular in plants, that shows that the pairing of homologous chromosomes, as observed at metaphase I, is affected by events occurring as early as the last premeiotic mitosis; and that the maintenance of this early determined state is subsequently maintained by constituents (presumably proteins) that are sensitive to either colchicine, temperature or gene control.

"2478131","abstracttext","The hexameric sequence ACGTCA functions in transcriptional regulation of wheat histone genes. The cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S RNA promoter has the same hexameric sequence, and mutation analyses confirmed that the hexamer contributed greatly to transcription from the 35S promoter when a test gene with this promoter was introduced into sunflower cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed the existence of a nuclear protein(s) in sunflower cells which is homologous to the HBP-1b that has been identified as binding to the 35S promoter in wheat. These results provide evidence of the involvement of the hexameric sequence and the HBP-1b-like DNA binding protein(s) in transcription from the 35S promoter."

An HBP-1-like protein, indistinguishable from wheat HBP-1 in its the DNA-binding specificity, is present in sunflower nuclear extract, an indication that HBP-1-like DNA-binding proteins also exist in dicots."

"2687023","abstracttext","Comparison between the sequence of the gene coding for the wheat mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit IV (nad4) and the cDNA sequence obtained by reverse transcription, using total wheat mtRNA as template, has shown the presence of a uridine residue, not encoded by the genomic sequence, at the exon2-exon3 junction of the spliced transcript. This U creates a non-encoded CUG leucine codon which is essential for maintaining the reading frame, as shown by the conservation of the amino acid sequence of the NAD4 protein in various species. The addition of a U or the specific post-transcriptional conversion of a C to a U could explain this phenomenon."

Chem. 266, 15790-15796). In this study, we have demonstrated that p72syk is expressed in porcine platelets at 0.1-0.2% of total protein and that the lectin wheat germ agglutinin induces an activation of p72syk against both auto- and exogenous-substrate-phosphorylation in porcine platelets. The activation of p72syk was abrogated by the coexistence of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine with wheat germ agglutinin. These data suggest that p72syk is a candidate of responsible protein-tyrosine kinase for platelet activation and that cell surface glycoprotein is involved in the activation of p72syk in platelets."

We report the isolation and characterization of four cDNAs corresponding to different members of the durum wheat HSP101 gene family. Expression analysis revealed differences in their induction. Accordingly, durum wheat HSP101 genes are differently regulated, therefore having distinct roles in stress response and thermotolerance acquisition. These findings are important for further dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying the stress response and for understanding the functions of the HSP101 family members. This information could be important for the exploitation of specific alleles in marker assisted selection for abiotic stress resistance."

The discoveries of RNA silencing mechanisms provide a transgenic approach for disease management.

We purified and identified what turned out to be a thaumatin-like protein through a combination of activity-guided fractionation, cation exchange chromatography, reversed-phase HPLC, and LC-MS/MS. Recombinant expression of the corresponding gene and testing the activity confirmed the inhibitory activity of the protein."

To obtain structural and functional information about this DNA-binding protein, we attempted to isolate a cDNA clone encoding HBP-2 on the basis of its ability to bind to a nonamer-containing 38-bp DNA fragment. Southwestern screening of a wheat cDNA library with concatenated 38-residue oligonucleotides as the probe produced one candidate clone. Nucleotide sequence analyses of this cDNA clone and the corresponding genomic clone showed that the protein deduced from the nucleotide sequence consisted of 261 amino acids and contained a set of zinc-finger motifs similar to those found in many eukaryotic transcription factors. The protein, named WZF1 (wheat zinc-finger protein 1), which was expressed from the cDNA in Escherichia coli cells, bound specifically and metal-ion-dependently to the nonamer-containing oligonucleotide. The WZF1 mRNA was highly expressed in the root apexes of wheat seedlings, but less so in the proximal portion of young leaves; whereas, histone H3 mRNA was highly expressed in both tissues. The expression patterns of the WZF1 and histone H3 genes in the early stages of germination differed, expression of the WZF1 gene being almost constant but not that of the H3 gene. The relationship of WZF1 and HBP-2 and the possible role of WZF1 in the histone gene expression were discussed."

"15918034","abstracttext","Polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) are involved in the time-dependent darkening and discolouration of Asian noodles and other wheat end products. In this study, a doubled haploid (DH) population derived from Chara (moderately high PPO activity)/WW2449 (low PPO activity) was screened for PPO activity based on L-DOPA and L-tyrosine assays using whole seeds. Both these assays were significantly genetically correlated (r = 0.91) in measuring the PPO activity in this DH population. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) analysis utilising a skeleton map enabled us to identify a major QTL controlling PPO activity based on L-DOPA and L-tyrosine on the long arm of chromosome 2A. The simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker GWM294b explained over 82% of the line mean phenotypic variation from samples collected in both 2000 and 2003. Four SSR markers were validated for PPO linkage in genetically diverse backgrounds and proven to correctly predict the PPO activity in more than 92% of wheat lines. Physical mapping using deletion lines of Chinese Spring has confirmed the location of the GWM294b, GWM312 and WMC170 on chromosome 2AL, between deletion breakpoints 2AL-C to 0.85. In order to identify functional gene markers, data searches for alignments between rice BAC/PAC clones assembled on chromosome 1 and 4, chromosome 7, and (1) the wheat expressed sequence tags mapped in deletion bin (2AL-C to 0.85) and (2) the coding sequence of a previously cloned wheat PPO gene were made and found significant sequence similarities with the PPO gene or common central domain of tyrosinase. Available PPO gene sequences in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database have revealed that there is a significant molecular diversity at the nucleotide and amino acid level in the wheat PPO genes."

"15942758","abstracttext","H13 is inherited as a major dominant resistance gene in wheat. It was previously mapped to chromosome 6DL and expresses a high level of antibiosis against Hessian fly (Hf) [Mayetiola destructor (Say)] larvae. The objective of this study was to identify tightly linked molecular markers for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding and as a starting point toward the map-based cloning of H13. Fifty-two chromosome 6D-specific microsatellite (simple sequence repeat) markers were tested for linkage to H13 using near-isogenic lines Molly (PI 562619) and Newton-207, and a segregating population consisting of 192 F(2:3) families derived from the cross PI 372129 (Dn4) x Molly (H13). Marker Xcfd132 co-segregated with H13, and several other markers were tightly linked to H13 in the distal region of wheat chromosome 6DS. Deletion analysis assigned H13 to a small region closely proximal to the breakpoint of del6DS-6 (FL 0.99). Further evaluation and comparison of the H13-linked markers revealed that the same chromosome region may also contain H23 in KS89WGRC03, an unnamed H gene (H(WGRC4)) in KS89WGRC04, the wheat curl mite resistance gene Cmc4, and a defense response gene Ppo for polyphenol oxidase. Thus, these genes comprise a cluster of arthropod resistance genes. Marker analysis also revealed that a very small intercalary chromosomal segment carrying H13 was transferred from the H13 donor parent to the wheat line Molly."

"18060568","abstracttext","Seventy-three gene sequences encoding monomeric alpha-amylase inhibitors were characterized from cultivated wheat ""Chinese Spring"", group 6 nullisomic-tetrasomic lines of ""Chinese Spring"" and diploid putative progenitors of common wheat. The monomeric alpha-amylase inhibitors from the different sources shared very high homology (99.54%). The different alpha-amylase inhibitors, which were determined by the 24 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of their gene sequences, were investigated. A total of 15 haplotypes were defined by sequence alignment, among which 9 haplotypes were found with only one single sequence sample. Haplotype H02 was found to be the main haplotype occurring in 83 WMAI sequence samples, followed by haplotype H11. The median-joining network for the 15 haplotypes of monomeric alpha-amylase inhibitor gene sequences from hexaploid wheats was star like, and at least two subclusters emerged. Furthermore evidence of homologous recombination was found between the haplotypes. The relationship between nucleotide substitutions and the amino acid changes in WMAI of hexaploid wheats was summarized. It was clear that only five polymorphic sites in the nucleotide sequence of WMAI resulted in amino acid variations, and that should be the reason for different structure and function of inhibitors. However, little evidence could be found that there were WMAI genes in the A genome of hexaploid wheat, whereas it could conclude from our results that the A genome diploid wheat had WMAI genes. The overall information on the monomeric alpha-amylase inhibitors from wheat and Aegilops strongly support the view that these inhibitors have evolved from a common ancestral gene through duplication and mutation."

Strain Q8r1-96 is representative of the D-genotype of 2,4-DAPG producers, which are exceptional because of their ability to aggressively colonize and maintain large populations on the roots of host plants, including wheat, pea, and sugar beet. In this study, three genes, an sss recombinase gene, ptsP, and orfT, which are important in the interaction of Pseudomonas spp. with various hosts, were investigated to determine their contributions to the unusual colonization properties of strain Q8r1-96. The sss recombinase and ptsP genes influence global processes, including phenotypic plasticity and organic nitrogen utilization, respectively. The orfT gene contributes to the pathogenicity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in plants and animals and is conserved among saprophytic rhizosphere pseudomonads, but its function is unknown. Clones containing these genes were identified in a Q8r1-96 genomic library, sequenced, and used to construct gene replacement mutants of Q8r1-96. Mutants were characterized to determine their 2,4-DAPG production, motility, fluorescence, colony morphology, exoprotease and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) production, carbon and nitrogen utilization, and ability to colonize the rhizosphere of wheat grown in natural soil. The ptsP mutant was impaired in wheat root colonization, whereas mutants with mutations in the sss recombinase gene and orfT were not. However, all three mutants were less competitive than wild-type P. fluorescens Q8r1-96 in the wheat rhizosphere when they were introduced into the soil by paired inoculation with the parental strain."

Wheat expressed sequence tags (ESTs) located in deletion bin C-1BL-6-0.32 were used to develop sequence tagged site (STS) markers. The EST-STS markers flanking Yr26 were used to identify collinear regions of the rice and B. distachyon genomes. Wheat ESTs with significant similarities in the two collinear regions were selected to develop conserved markers for fine mapping of Yr26. Thirty-one markers were mapped to the Yr26 region, and six of them cosegregated with the resistance gene. Marker orders were highly conserved between rice and B. distachyon, but some rearrangements were observed between rice and wheat. Two flanking markers (CON-4 and CON-12) further narrowed the genomic region containing Yr26 to a 1.92 Mb region in B. distachyon chromosome 3 and a 1.17 Mb region in rice chromosome 10, and two putative resistance gene analogs were identified in the collinear region of B. distachyon. The markers developed in this study provide a potential target site for further map-based cloning of Yr26 and should be useful in marker assisted selection for pyramiding the gene with other resistance genes."

"24794977","abstracttext_key message","This article covers detailed characterization and naming of QSr.sun - 5BL as Sr56 . Molecular markers linked with adult plant stem rust resistance gene Sr56 were identified and validated for marker-assisted selection. The identification of new sources of adult plant resistance (APR) and effective combinations of major and minor genes is well appreciated in breeding for durable rust resistance in wheat. A QTL, QSr.sun-5BL, contributed by winter wheat cultivar Arina providing 12-15Â % reduction in stem rust severity, was reported in an Arina/Forno recombinant inbred line (RIL) population. Following the demonstration of monogenic segregation for APR in the Arina/Yitpi RIL population, the resistance locus was formally named Sr56. Saturation mapping of the Sr56 region using STS (from EST and DArT clones), SNP (9Â K) and SSR markers from wheat chromosome survey sequences that were ordered based on synteny with Brachypodium distachyon genes in chromosome 1 resulted in the flanking of Sr56 by sun209 (SSR) and sun320 (STS) at 2.6 and 1.2Â cM on the proximal and distal ends, respectively. Investigation of conservation of gene order between the Sr56 region in wheat and B. distachyon showed that the syntenic region defined by SSR marker interval sun209-sun215 corresponded to approximately 192Â kb in B. distachyon, which contains five predicted genes. Conservation of gene order for the Sr56 region between wheat and Brachypodium, except for two inversions, provides a starting point for future map-based cloning of Sr56. The Arina/Forno RILs carrying both Sr56 and Sr57 exhibited low disease severity compared to those RILs carrying these genes singly. Markers linked with Sr56 would be useful for marker-assisted pyramiding of this gene with other major and APR genes for which closely linked markers are available."

"23957588","abstracttext_background","The grain aphid (Sitobion avenae F.) is a major agricultural pest which causes significant yield losses of wheat in China, Europe and North America annually. Transcriptome profiling of the grain aphid alimentary canal after feeding on wheat plants could provide comprehensive gene expression information involved in feeding, ingestion and digestion. Furthermore, selection of aphid-specific RNAi target genes would be essential for utilizing a plant-mediated RNAi strategy to control aphids via a non-toxic mode of action. However, due to the tiny size of the alimentary canal and lack of genomic information on grain aphid as a whole, selection of the RNAi targets is a challenging task that as far as we are aware, has never been documented previously."
"23957588","abstracttext_results","In this study, we performed de novo transcriptome assembly and gene expression analyses of the alimentary canals of grain aphids before and after feeding on wheat plants using Illumina RNA sequencing. The transcriptome profiling generated 30,427 unigenes with an average length of 664 bp. Furthermore, comparison of the transcriptomes of alimentary canals of pre- and post feeding grain aphids indicated that 5490 unigenes were differentially expressed, among which, diverse genes and/or pathways were identified and annotated. Based on the RPKM values of these unigenes, 16 of them that were significantly up or down-regulated upon feeding were selected for dsRNA artificial feeding assay. Of these, 5 unigenes led to higher mortality and developmental stunting in an artificial feeding assay due to the down-regulation of the target gene expression. Finally, by adding fluorescently labelled dsRNA into the artificial diet, the spread of fluorescence signal in the whole body tissues of grain aphid was observed."

This finding would provide a fundamental basis for aphid control in wheat through plant mediated RNAi strategy."
"24244507","articletitle","Mutant alleles of Photoperiod-1 in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) that confer a late flowering phenotype in long days."
"24244507","abstracttext","Flowering time in wheat and barley is known to be modified by mutations in the Photoperiod-1 (Ppd-1) gene. Semi-dominant Ppd-1a mutations conferring an early flowering phenotype are well documented in wheat but gene sequencing has also identified candidate loss of function mutations for Ppd-A1 and Ppd-D1. By analogy to the recessive ppd-H1 mutation in barley, loss of function mutations in wheat are predicted to delay flowering under long day conditions. To test this experimentally, introgression lines were developed in the spring wheat variety 'Paragon'. Plants lacking a Ppd-B1 gene were identified from a gamma irradiated 'Paragon' population. These were crossed with the other introgression lines to generate plants with candidate loss of function mutations on one, two or three genomes. Lines lacking Ppd-B1 flowered 10 to 15 days later than controls under long days. Candidate loss of function Ppd-A1 alleles delayed flowering by 1 to 5 days while candidate loss of function Ppd-D1 alleles did not affect flowering time. Loss of Ppd-A1 gave an enhanced effect, and loss of Ppd-D1 became detectable in lines where Ppd-B1 was absent, indicating effects may be buffered by functional Ppd-1 alleles on other genomes. Expression analysis revealed that delayed flowering was associated with reduced expression of the TaFT1 gene and increased expression of TaCO1. A survey of the GEDIFLUX wheat collection grown in the UK and North Western Europe between the 1940s and 1980s and the A.E. Watkins global collection of landraces from the 1920s and 1930s showed that the identified candidate loss of function mutations for Ppd-D1 were common and widespread, while the identified candidate Ppd-A1 loss of function mutation was rare in countries around the Mediterranean and in the Far East but was common in North Western Europe. This may reflect a possible benefit of the latter in northern locations."

A SNP marker within a sequence similar to catalase (Cat3-A1snp) derived from full-length (FL) cDNA (AK332460), however, was consistently associated with the QTL on 7AL and implicated in regulating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to control carotenoid accumulation affecting flour b* colour. The number of catalase genes on chromosome 7AL was investigated in this study to identify which gene may be implicated in flour b* variation and two were identified through interrogation of the draft wheat genome survey sequence consisting of five exons and a further two members having eight exons identified through comparative analysis with the single catalase gene on rice chromosome 6, PCR amplification and sequencing. It was evident that the catalase genes on chromosome 7A had duplicated and diverged during evolution relative to its counterpart on rice chromosome 6. The detection of transcripts in seeds, the co-location with Cat3-A1snp marker and maximised alignment of FL-cDNA (AK332460) with cognate genomic sequence indicated that TaCat3-A1 was the member of the catalase gene family associated with flour b* colour variation. Re-sequencing identified three alleles from three wheat varieties, TaCat3-A1a, TaCat3-A1b and TaCat3-A1c, and their predicted protein identified differences in peroxisomal targeting signal tri-peptide domain in the carboxyl terminal end providing new insights into their potential role in regulating cellular H2O2 that contribute to flour b* colour variation."

"26063390","abstracttext","Only limited public transcriptomics resources are available for durum wheat and its responses to environmental changes. We developed a quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) platform for analysing the expression of primary C and N metabolism genes in durum wheat in leaves (125 genes) and roots (38 genes), based on available bread wheat genes and the identification of orthologs of known genes in other species. We also assessed the expression stability of seven reference genes for qRT-PCR under varying environments. We therefore present a functional qRT-PCR platform for gene expression analysis in durum wheat, and suggest using the ADP-ribosylation factor as a reference gene for qRT-PCR normalization. We investigated the effects of elevated [CO(2)] and temperature at two levels of N supply on C and N metabolism by combining gene expression analysis, using our qRT-PCR platform, with biochemical and physiological parameters in durum wheat grown in field chambers. Elevated CO(2) down-regulated the photosynthetic capacity and led to the loss of N compounds, including Rubisco; this effect was exacerbated at low N. Mechanistically, the reduction in photosynthesis and N levels could be associated with a decreased transcription of the genes involved in photosynthesis and N assimilation. High temperatures increased stomatal conductance, and thus did not inhibit photosynthesis, even though Rubisco protein and activity, soluble protein, leaf N, and gene expression for C fixation and N assimilation were down-regulated. Under a future scenario of climate change, the extent to which C fixation capacity and N assimilation are down-regulated will depend upon the N supply."

"26191066","abstracttext","A total of 205 wheat cultivars from the Yellow and Huai valley of China were used to identify allelic variations of vernalization and photoperiod response genes, as well as the copy number variations (CNVs) of Ppd-B1 and Vrn-A1 genes. A novel Vrn-D1 allele with 174-bp insertion in the promoter region of the recessive allele vrn-D1 was discovered in three Chinese wheat cultivars and designated as Vrn-D1c. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that cultivars with the Vrn-D1c allele exhibited significantly higher expression of the Vrn-D1 gene than that in cultivars with the recessive allele vrn-D1, indicating that the 174-bp insertion of Vrn-D1c contributed to the increase in Vrn-D1 gene expression and caused early heading and flowering. The five new cis-elements (Box II-like, 3-AF1 binding site, TC-rich repeats, Box-W1 and CAT-box) in the 174-bp insertion possibly promoted the basal activity level of Vrn-D1 gene. Two new polymorphism combinations of photoperiod genes were identified and designated as Ppd-D1_Hapl-IX and Ppd-D1_Hapl-X. Association of the CNV of Ppd-B1 gene with the heading and flowering days showed that the cultivars with Ppd-B1_Hapl-VI demonstrated the earliest heading and flowering times, and those with Ppd-B1_Hapl-IV presented the latest heading and flowering times in three cropping seasons. Distribution of the vernalization and photoperiod response genes indicated that all recessive alleles at the four vernalization response loci, Ppd-B1_Hapl-I at Ppd-B1 locus, and Ppd-D1_Hapl-I at the Ppd-D1 locus were predominant in Chinese winter wheat cultivars. This study can provide useful information for wheat breeding programs to screen wheat cultivars with relatively superior adaptability and maturity."

"26391470","abstracttext_background","Wheat stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is a costly global disease that burdens farmers with yield loss and high fungicide expenses. This sophisticated biotrophic parasite infiltrates wheat leaves and develops infection structures inside host cells, appropriating nutrients while suppressing the plant defense response. Development in most eukaryotes is regulated by small RNA molecules, and the success of host-induced gene silencing technology in Puccinia spp. implies the existence of a functional RNAi system. However, some fungi lack this capability, and small RNAs have not yet been reported in rust fungi. The objective of this study was to determine whether P. striiformis carries an endogenous small RNA repertoire."
"26391470","abstracttext_results","We extracted small RNA from rust-infected wheat flag leaves and performed high-throughput sequencing. Two wheat cultivars were analyzed: one is susceptible; the other displays partial high-temperature adult plant resistance. Fungal-specific reads were identified by mapping to the P. striiformis draft genome and removing reads present in uninfected control libraries. Sequencing and bioinformatics results were verified by RT-PCR. Like other RNAi-equipped fungi, P. striiformis produces large numbers of 20-22 nt sequences with a preference for uracil at the 5' position. Precise post-transcriptional processing and high accumulation of specific sRNA sequences were observed. Some predicted sRNA precursors possess a microRNA-like stem-loop secondary structure; others originate from much longer inverted repeats containing gene sequences. Finally, sRNA-target prediction algorithms were used to obtain a list of putative gene targets in both organisms. Predicted fungal target genes were enriched for kinases and small secreted proteins, while the list of wheat targets included homologs of known plant resistance genes."
"26391470","abstracttext_conclusions","This work provides an inventory of small RNAs endogenous to an important plant pathogen, enabling further exploration of gene regulation on both sides of the host/parasite interaction. We conclude that small RNAs are likely to play a role in regulating the complex developmental processes involved in stripe rust pathogenicity."

"25533209","abstracttext_key message","A new powdery mildew resistance gene Pm54 was identified on chromosome 6BL in soft red winter wheat. Powdery mildew is causing increasing damage to wheat production in the southeastern USA. To combat the disease, a continuing need exists to discover new genes for powdery mildew resistance and to incorporate those genes into breeding programs. Pioneer(Â®) variety 26R61 (shortened as 26R61) and AGS 2000 have been used as checks in the Uniform Southern Soft Red Winter Wheat Nursery for a decade, and both have provided good resistance across regions during that time. In the present study, a genetic analysis of mildew resistance was conducted on a RIL population developed from a cross of 26R61 and AGS 2000. Phenotypic evaluation was conducted in the field at Plains, GA, and Raleigh, NC, in 2012 and 2013, a total of four environments. Three quantitative trait loci (QTL) with major effect were consistently detected on wheat chromosomes 2BL, 4A and 6BL. The 2BL QTL contributed by 26R61 was different from Pm6, a widely used gene in the southeastern USA. The other two QTL were identified from AGS 2000. The 6BL QTL was subsequently characterized as a simple Mendelian factor when the population was inoculated with a single Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) isolate in controlled environments. Since there is no known powdery mildew resistance gene (Pm) on this particular location of common wheat, the gene was designated Pm54. The closely linked marker Xbarc134 was highly polymorphic in a set of mildew differentials, indicating that the marker should be useful for pyramiding Pm54 with other Pm genes by marker-assisted selection."
"25475935","articletitle","QTL analysis of genetic loci affecting domestication-related spike characters in common wheat."
"25475935","abstracttext","Domestication-related changes that govern a spike morphology suitable for seed harvesting in cereals have resulted from mutation and selection of the genes. A synthetic hexaploid wheat (S-6214, genome AABBDD) produced by a cross between durum wheat (AABB) and wild goat grass (DD) showed partial non-domestication-related phenotypes due to genetic effects of the wild goat grass genome. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting wheat domestication-related spike characters including spike threshability, rachis fragility and spike compactness were investigated in F2 progeny of a cross between Chinese Spring (CS) wheat (AABBDD) and S-6214. Of 15 relevant QTLs identified, eight seemed to be consistent with peaks previously reported in wheat, while four QTL regions were novel. Four QTLs that affected spike threshability were localized to chromosomes 2BS, 2DS, 4D and 5DS. The QTL on 2DS probably represents the tenacious glume gene, Tg-D1. Based on its map position, the QTL located on 2BS coincides with Ppd-B1 and seems to be a homoeolocus of the soft glume gene. Two novel QTLs were detected on 4D and 5DS, and their goat grass alleles increased glume tenacity. Three novel QTLs located on 2DL, 3DL and 4D for rachis fragility were found. Based on the map position, the QTL on 3DL seems different from Br1 and Br2 loci and its CS allele appears to promote the generation of barrel-type diaspores. Three disarticulation types of spikelets were found in F2 individuals: wedge-type, barrel-type and both types. Among eight QTL peaks that governed spike morphology, six, located on 2AS, 2BS, 2DS, 4AL and 5AL, coincided with ones previously reported. A QTL for spike compactness on 5AL was distinct from the Q gene. A novel QTL that controls spike length was detected on 5DL. Complex genetic interactions between genetic background and the action of each gene were suggested."
"25732534","articletitle","A wheat ABC transporter contributes to both grain formation and mycotoxin tolerance."
"25732534","abstracttext","The mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) acts as a disease virulence factor for Fusarium fungi, and tolerance of DON enhances wheat resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease. Two variants of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family C transporter gene were cloned from DON-treated wheat mRNA, namely TaABCC3.1 and TaABCC3.2. These represent two of three putative genes identified on chromosomes 3A, 3B, and 3D of the wheat genome sequence. Variant TaABCC3.1 represents the DON-responsive transcript previously associated with DON resistance in wheat. PCR-based mapping and in silico sequence analyses located TaABCC3.1 to the short arm of wheat chromosome 3B (not within the FHB resistance quantitative trait locus Fhb1). In silico analyses of microarray data indicated that TaABCC3 genes are expressed in reproductive tissue and roots, and in response to the DON producer Fusarium graminearum. Gene expression studies showed that TaABCC3.1 is activated as part of the early host response to DON and in response to the FHB defence hormone jasmonic acid. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) confirmed that TaABCC3 genes contributed to DON tolerance. VIGS was performed using two independent viral construct applications: one specifically targeted TaABCC3.1 for silencing, while the other targeted this gene and the chromosome 3A homeologue. In both instances, VIGS resulted in more toxin-induced discoloration of spikelets, compared with the DON effects in non-silenced spikelets at 14 d after toxin treatment (â¥2.2-fold increase, P<0.05). Silencing by both VIGS constructs enhanced head ripening, and especially so in DON-treated heads. VIGS of TaABCC3 genes also reduced the grain number by more than 28% (P<0.05), both with and without DON treatment, and the effects were greater for the construct that targeted the two homeologues. Hence, DON-responsive TaABCC3 genes warrant further study to determine their potential as disease resistance breeding targets and their function in grain formation and ripening."

"27484261","abstracttext","The objective of this study was to determine the impact of wheat bran and its main polysaccharides on intestinal bacteria and gene expression of intestinal barrier function relevant proteins. Thirty freshly weaned male piglets were assigned randomly to five dietary treatment groups with six piglets per group. Accordingly, five synthetic diets including a basal control diet without fiber components (CON), wheat bran diet (10% wheat bran, WB), arabinoxylan diet (AX), cellulose diet (CEL) and combined diet of arabinoxylan and cellulose (CB) were studied. The piglets were fed ad libitum for 30Â d. Lower Escherichia coli (E. coli) populations in WB group and higher probiotic (Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) populations in groups fed diets containing arabinoxylan (WB, AX and CB) were observed and compared with CON group. Compared with CON group, the gene expressions of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), calcium-activated chloride channel regulator 1 (CLCA1) and voltage-gated chloride channel 2 (CIC2) were suppressed in the WB group. And wheat bran down-regulated gene expression of pro-inflammation (TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², IL-6) and TLRs/MyD88/NF-ÎºB pathway compared with CON group. In conclusion, wheat bran and its main polysaccharides could change intestinal microflora and down-regulate the gene expression of intestinal barrier function relevant proteins in the distal small intestinal mucosa."

In this study, five novel vectors which used gusA and bar as a reporter gene and a selection marker gene, respectively, were constructed based on the pCLEAN dual binary vector system. Among these vectors, 1G7B and 5G7B carried two T-DNAs located on two respective plasmids with 5G7B possessing an additional virGwt gene. 5LBTG154 and 5TGTB154 carried two T-DNAs in the target plasmid with either one or double right borders, and 5BTG154 carried the selectable marker gene on the backbone outside of the T-DNA left border in the target plasmid. In addition, 5BTG154, 5LBTG154, and 5TGTB154 used pAL154 as a helper plasmid which contains Komari fragment to facilitate transformation. These five dual binary vector combinations were transformed into Agrobacterium strain AGL1 and used to transform durum wheat cv Stewart 63. Evaluation of the co-transformation efficiencies, the frequencies of marker-free transgenic plants, and integration of backbone sequences in the obtained transgenic lines indicated that two vectors (5G7B and 5TGTB154) were more efficient in generating marker-free transgenic wheat plants with no or minimal integration of backbone sequences in the wheat genome. The vector series developed in this study for generation of marker- and/or backbone-free transgenic wheat plants via Agrobacterium -mediated transformation will be useful to facilitate the creation of ""clean"" GM wheat containing only the foreign genes of agronomic importance."

"27705664","abstracttext","Stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, is a destructive disease of wheat that can be controlled by deploying effective stem rust resistance (Sr) genes. Highly virulent races of P. graminis f. sp. tritici in Africa have been detected and characterized. These include race TRTTF and the Ug99 group of races such as TTKSK. Several Canadian and U.S. spring wheat cultivars, including the widely grown Canadian cultivar 'Harvest', are resistant to TRTTF. However, the genetic basis of resistance to TRTTF in Canadian and U.S. spring wheat cultivars is unknown. The objectives of this study were to determine the number of Sr genes involved in TRTTF resistance in Harvest, genetically map the resistance with DNA markers, and use markers to assess the distribution of that resistance in a panel of Canadian cultivars. A doubled haploid (DH) population was produced from the cross LMPG-6S/Harvest. The DH population was tested with race TRTTF at the seedling stage. Of 92 DH progeny evaluated, 46 were resistant and 46 were susceptible which perfectly fit a 1:1 ratio indicating a single Sr gene was responsible for conferring resistance to TRTTF in Harvest. Mapping with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers placed the resistance gene distally on the chromosome 6AS genetic map, which corresponded to the location reported for Sr8. SSR marker gwm459 and 30 cosegregating SNP markers showed the closest linkage, mapping 2.2 cM proximal to the Sr gene. Gene Sr8a confers resistance to TRTTF and may account for the resistance in Harvest. Testing a panel of Canadian wheat cultivars with four SNP markers closely linked to resistance to TRTTF suggested that the resistance present in Harvest is present in many Canadian cultivars. Two of these SNP markers were also predictive of TRTTF resistance in a panel of 241 spring wheat lines from the United States, Canada, and Mexico."

Exploring new resistance genes is essential for breeding resistant wheat cultivars. PI 182103, a spring wheat landrace originally from Pakistan, has shown a high level of resistance to stripe rust in fields for many years, but genes for resistance to stripe rust in the variety have not been studied. To map the resistance gene(s) in PI 182103, 185 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were developed from a cross with Avocet Susceptible (AvS). The RIL population was genotyped with simple sequence repeat (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism markers and tested with races PST-100 and PST-114 at the seedling stage under controlled greenhouse conditions and at the adult-plant stage in fields at Pullman and Mt. Vernon, Washington under natural infection by the stripe rust pathogen in 2011, 2012, and 2013. A total of five quantitative trait loci (QTL) were detected. QyrPI182103.wgp-2AS and QyrPI182103.wgp-3AL were detected at the seedling stage, QyrPI182103.wgp-4DL was detected only in Mt.

QyrPI182103.wgp-7BL was identified as a high-temperature adult-plant resistance gene and detected in all field tests. Interactions among the QTL were mostly additive, but some negative interactions were detected. The 7BL QTL was mapped in chromosomal bin 7BL 0.40 to 0.45 and identified as a new gene, permanently designated as Yr79. SSR markers Xbarc72 and Xwmc335 flanking the Yr79 locus were highly polymorphic in various wheat genotypes, indicating that the molecular markers are useful for incorporating the new gene for potentially durable stripe rust resistance into new wheat cultivars."

"32062676","abstracttext_key message","Genetic atlas, reliable QTL and candidate genes of yield component traits in wheat were figured out, laying concrete foundations for map-based gene cloning and dissection of regulatory mechanisms underlying yield. Mining genetic loci for yield is challenging due to the polygenic nature, large influence of environment and complex relationship among yield component traits (YCT). Many genetic loci related to wheat yield have been identified, but its genetic architecture and key genetic loci for selection are largely unknown. Wheat yield potential can be determined by three YCT, thousand kernel weight, kernel number per spike and spike number. Here, we summarized the genetic loci underpinning YCT from QTL mapping, association analysis and homology-based gene cloning. The major loci determining yield-associated agronomic traits, such as flowering time and plant height, were also included in comparative analyses with those for YCT. We integrated yield-related genetic loci onto chromosomes based on their physical locations. To identify the major stable loci for YCT, 58 QTL-rich clusters (QRC) were defined based on their distribution on chromosomes. Candidate genes in each QRC were predicted according to gene annotation of the wheat reference genome and previous information on validation of those genes in other species. Finally, a technological route was proposed to take full advantage of the resultant resources for gene cloning, molecular marker-assisted breeding and dissection of molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying wheat yield."

"30487803","abstracttext","Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is an important tool for functional genomics studies in plants. With this method, it is possible to target most endogenous genes and downregulate the messenger RNA (mRNA) in a sequence-specific manner. Chinese wheat mosaic virus (CWMV) has a bipartite, single-strand positive RNA genome, and can infect both wheat and Nicotiana benthamiana , and the optimal temperature for systemic infection in plants is 17Â°C. To assess the potential of the virus as a vector for gene silencing at low temperature, a fragment of the N. benthamiana or wheat phytoene desaturase (PDS) gene was expressed from a modified CWMV RNA2 clone and the resulting photo bleaching in infected plants was used as a reporter for silencing. Downregulation of PDS mRNA was also measured by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). In experiments using fragments of PDS ranging from 500 to 1500 nucleotides, insert length influenced the stability and the efficiency of VIGS. The CWMV induced silencing system was also used to suppress miR165/166 and miR3134a through expression of miRNA target mimics. The relative expression levels of mature miR165/166 and miR3134a decreased whereas the transcript levels of their target genes increased. Interestingly, we also found the CWMV-induced silencing system was more efficient compare with the vector based on Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) or Foxtail mosaic virus (FoMV) in wheat or the vector based on TRV in N. benthamiana at 17Â°C. In summary, the CWMV vector is effective in silencing endogenous genes and miRNAs at 17Â°C, thereby providing a powerful tool for gene function analysis in both N. benthamiana and wheat at low temperature."

Thus, HTS-1 is highly valuable for studies of wheat hybrid breeding and flower development. Previous studies have shown that two major genes (Pis1 and hts) control pistillody in HTS-1. The Pis1 gene controls the three-pistil trait in the three-pistil wheat mutant and has been mapped on chromosome 2D, but the hts gene has not been mapped or identified.

We then mapped hts between GBS-SNP markers 4A_109 and 4A_119, separated by 2.0âcM and 5.2âMb. To find the candidate genes, the hts region was enlarged to 7.2âMb, encompassing 752 protein-coding genes. We identified TaWin1 as a possible candidate gene after comparing the 752 genes with 206 common differentially expressed genes between pistillody stamens (PS) versus normal stamens (S) and pistils (P) versus S. Real-time PCR indicated that TaWin1 was highly expressed in HTS-1 during the pistil-and-stamen-differentiating stage, at levels approximately 120 times greater than those in CM28TP. Further analysis indicated that TaWin1 was mainly expressed in HTS-1 PS, supporting its status as a candidate gene of hts.

"30686226","abstracttext","Wheat is one of the major food crops in the world. Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is an economically important disease that affects wheat worldwide. The discovery of novel resistance genes and the deployment of effectively resistant cultivars are important for the ongoing control of wheat stripe rust and the maintenance of the agricultural productivity of wheat. CH7086, a new stripe rust-resistant wheat introgression line, was selected by crossing susceptible cultivars with the resistant Thinopyrum ponticum-derived partial amphiploid Xiaoyan 7430. The resistance of CH7086 is effective against all current Chinese P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races. CH7086 was crossed with the stripe rust-susceptible cultivars to develop F 1 , F 2 , F 3 , and BC 1 populations for genetic analysis. Segregation in the F 2 and BC 1 populations and F 2:3 lines were tested for resistance against the P. striiformis f. sp. tritici race CYR32. This test showed that CH7086 carries a single dominant gene for stripe rust resistance, which was temporarily designated YrCH86. The closest of the eight simple sequence repeat (SSR) and expressed sequence tag-SSR markers flanking the locus were X2AS33, which is 1.9 cM distal, and Xmag3807, which is 3.1 cM proximal. The resistance gene and its polymorphic markers were placed in deletion bin 2AS-0.78-1.00 using the 'Chinese Spring' nullisomic-tetrasomic, ditelosomic, and deletion lines. The tests of both allelism and resistance specificity suggested that the resistance gene found in CH7086 was not Yr17, which was the only current formally named Yr gene on chromosome 2AS. Thus, YrCH86 appeared to be a new locus and was permanently designated Yr69."

Qingxinmai is resistant to many Bgt isolates collected from different wheat fields in China. F 1 , F 2 , and F 2:3 generations of the cross between Qingxinmai and powdery mildew susceptible line 041133 were developed. It was confirmed that a single recessive gene, PmQ , conferred the seedling resistance to a Bgt isolate in Qingxinmai. Bulked segregant analysis-RNA-Seq (BSR-Seq) was performed on the bulked homozygous resistant and susceptible F 2:3 families, which detected 57 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants that were enriched in a 40 Mb genomic interval on chromosome arm 2BL. Based on the flanking sequences of the candidate SNPs extracted from the Chinese Spring reference genome, 485 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were designed. Six polymorphic SSR markers, together with nine markers that were anchored on chromosome arm 2BL, were used to construct a genetic linkage map for PmQ . This gene was placed in a 1.4 cM genetic interval between markers Xicsq405 and WGGBH913 corresponding to 4.9 Mb physical region in the Chinese Spring reference genome. PmQ differed from most of the other Pm genes identified on chromosome arm 2BL based on its position and/or origin. However, this gene and Pm63 from an Iranian common wheat landrace were located in a similar genomic region, so they may be allelic."
"31317234","articletitle","Development of mlo-based resistance in tetraploid wheat against wheat powdery mildew."
"31317234","abstracttext","Powdery mildew is a severe disease in wheat. In barley, durable resistance exists, based on non-functionality of the Mlo gene. As a model to analyse the effects of mutagenesis in the homoeologous Mlo genes of wheat, we developed mlo-based powdery mildew resistance in tetraploid durum wheat. To obtain Mlo mutations, we screened a TILLING population developed in tetraploid wheat ""Kronos"" for which the captured exome sequence ofÂ â>â1500 lines is available. This resulted in 23 mutants for Mlo-A1 and 26 non-redundant mutants for Mlo-B1. Two Mlo-A1 and four Mlo-B1 mutants were crossed to obtain eight F 2 mutant lines that showed a range of phenotypes from susceptibility to full resistance. Pot experiments under semi-field conditions confirmed the resistance levels for six of the mutants without any signs of adverse pleiotropic effects. Resistance ranking was similar across six powdery mildew isolates, indicating no isolate specificity of the mlo-based resistance. The effect of mutations in the Mlo-B1 gene was stronger than in the Mlo-A1 gene, probably reflecting differences in wild-type Mlo gene expression levels. Strong partial resistance effects were observed with single mlo-B1 mutations hence, revealing a dosage effect of mlo mutant alleles. Two of the four mlo-B1 mutations (W163* and P335L) were very strong; however, the highest combined effect was observed with the MloA-P335S/MloB-P335L combination, suggesting that non-functional, but full-length Mlo proteins might have the strongest effect compared with nonsense mutations. Our results show that mlo-based resistance might offer possibilities to introduce durable protection in tetraploid wheat against powdery mildew."

However, in wheat, the CAMTA gene family has not been systematically characterized."
"32928120","abstracttext_results","In this work, 15 wheat CAMTA genes were identified using a genome-wide search method. Their chromosome location, physicochemical properties, subcellular localization, gene structure, protein domain, and promoter cis-elements were systematically analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis classified the TaCAMTA genes into three groups (groups A, B, and C), numbered 7, 6, and 2, respectively. The results showed that most TaCAMTA genes contained stress-related cis-elements. Finally, to obtain tissue-specific and stress-responsive candidates, the expression profiles of the TaCAMTAs in various tissues and under biotic and abiotic stresses were investigated. Tissue-specific expression analysis showed that all of the 15 TaCAMTA genes were expressed in multiple tissues with different expression levels, as well as under abiotic stress, the expressions of each TaCAMTA gene could respond to at least one abiotic stress. It also found that 584 genes in wheat genome were predicted to be potential target genes by CAMTA, demonstrating that CAMTA can be widely involved in plant development and growth, as well as coping with stresses."

"1660887","articletitle","Cloning of a 16-kDa ubiquitin carrier protein from wheat and Arabidopsis thaliana. Identification of functional domains by in vitro mutagenesis."
"1660887","abstracttext","Ubiquitin carrier proteins (E2s) are involved in the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to a variety of cellular target proteins in eukaryotes. Here, we report the cloning of genes from wheat and Arabidopsis thaliana that encode 16-kDa E2s and a domain analysis of E2s by in vitro mutagenesis. The genes for E216kDa, which we have designated wheat and At UBC1, encode proteins that are only 33% identical (58% similar) with a 23-kDa E2 from wheat (encoded by the gene now designated wheat UBC4), but are 63% identical (82% similar) with the E2 encoded by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA repair gene, RAD6. Unlike the proteins encoded by RAD6 and wheat UBC4, the UBC1 gene products lack acidic C-terminal domains extending beyond the conserved core of the proteins and are incapable of efficient in vitro ligation of ubiquitin to histones. From enzymatic analysis of the UBC1 and UBC4 gene products mutagenized in vitro, we have identified several domains important for E2 function, including the active site cysteine and N-terminal and C-terminal domains. Cysteine residues 88 and 85 in the UBC1 and UBC4 gene products, respectively, are necessary for formation of the ubiquitin-E2 thiol ester intermediate. Whereas the UBC1 gene product does not require its additional cysteine residue at position 116 for thiol ester formation, alteration of cysteine 143 in the UBC4 gene product greatly diminishes this ability. The N terminus of UBC1 contains two domains that affect activity: a proximal region containing hydroxylated and uncharged residues whose removal increases the rate of thiol ester formation and a distal tract rich in basic residues. Deletion or substitution of these basic residues with neutral residues diminishes the rate of thiol ester formation. We have demonstrated also that C-terminal extensions can function to confer substrate specificity to E2s. When the acidic extension was deleted from UBC4, the protein was unable to efficiently conjugate ubiquitin to histones in vitro. Furthermore, fusion of the UBC4 acidic extension to the C terminus of UBC1 resulted in a chimeric protein capable of efficient histone conjugation, as did fusion of short tracts of alternating aspartate and glutamate residues. This result suggests that the target protein specificity of E2s can be altered by the addition of appropriate C-terminal extensions, thus providing a way to modify the selectivity of the ubiquitin system."
"1302642","articletitle","A gibberellin-regulated gene from wheat with sequence homology to cathepsin B of mammalian cells."
"1302642","abstracttext","A previous report described several cDNAs corresponding to mRNAs which accumulated in wheat aleurone layers treated with gibberellic acid (GA) (Baulcombe and Buffard, 1983). The protein sequence deduced from one of these clones (2529) has extensive similarity to the thiol protease, cathepsin B from mammalian cells. Southern analysis of wheat DNA has shown that the 2529 mRNA is encoded by a small family of genes carried on the group 4 chromosome. The nucleotide sequence of a member of the gene family expressed at a low level in aleurone layers and the use of a primer extension assay to identify a clone of a member of the gene family producing an abundant mRNA are reported. The 2529 mRNA accumulates in the scutellum and the aleurone layer of germinating grains where its expression is regulated by GA. In the scutellum the expression was restricted to the parenchyma, suggesting that the 2529 product may have a role other than for mobilization of the endosperm."
"1463828","articletitle","Protein-binding to reiterated motifs within the wheat rRNA gene promoter and upstream repeats."
"1463828","abstracttext","The binding of specific proteins in wheat nuclear extracts to the -34 to +10 region of the wheat ribosomal RNA gene promoter has been detected. DNase I footprinting revealed two binding regions, one spanning the transcription initiation site from -7 to +2, and a larger one further upstream from around -29 to -15. An oligonucleotide made to the -30 to -14 promoter region binds a protein in a sequence-specific manner. This protein also binds specifically to sites with related sequences further upstream in the promoter and in the associated intergenic spacer repeats. A consensus sequence, CATGG--GC-AAAAC, was defined from the different binding sites of the protein. These results, taken together with in vivo results on the enhanced activity of nucleoli containing ribosomal RNA genes with more intergenic spacer repeats, endorse the hypothesis that ribosomal RNA gene transcription is regulated by the extent of binding of a protein to many sites upstream of the transcriptional start site."
"1465102","articletitle","Improvement of plant regeneration and GUS expression in scutellar wheat calli by optimization of culture conditions and DNA-microprojectile delivery procedures."
"1465102","abstracttext","Genetic transformation of cereals by direct DNA delivery via microprojectile bombardment has become an established procedure in recent years. But the derivation of functional transgenic plants, especially in wheat, is still problematic, mainly due to low efficiency of DNA delivery and the reduced regeneration capability of microprojectile-bombarded tissue. We focussed on these two aspects and found that the regeneration of scutellar calli of wheat can be rendered highly efficient and considerably accelerated by a liquid culture phase in screen rafts. We also found that the expression of a reporter gene following DNA delivery by microprojectile can be improved by maintaining the scutellar calli in 0.25 M mannitol before and after bombardment, by bombardment in the presence of silver thiosulfate and Ca(NO3)2 (rather than CaCl2) and by the elimination of spermidine from the DNA/microprojectile mixture. A protocol that includes all these features leads to several-fold higher transient expression of the reporter gene than have previously published procedures."
"1508994","articletitle","Small acidic peptides from wheat germ chromatin. I. Isolation and biochemical characterization."
"1508994","abstracttext","RNA synthesis in cell and cell-free systems is inhibited by a family of acidic, low molecular weight chromatin peptides (CPs). These peptides were extracted from deproteinized DNA of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, but the low yield of purified material by this procedure hinders efforts aimed at understanding their action mechanism in gene regulation. In this report we describe two purification methods of CPs from an easily available source, wheat germ. A comparison is made between the method starting from deproteinized DNA and the method from purified chromatin. The biological effects (inhibition of L1210 cell growth and DNA in vitro transcription) of CPs from wheat germ together with their chemical characteristics (molecular weight, amino acid composition and presence of phosphoserine) show strong homology with those of CPs from other sources. These results suggest a possible role of these chromatin peptides in controlling gene expression."
"2562504","articletitle","Uptake and transient expression of chimeric genes in seed-derived embryos."
"2562504","abstracttext","Uptake of DNA in dry and viable embryos of wheat by imbibition in DNA solution was detected by monitoring the transient expression of chimeric genes. Gene expression vectors used in this study contained a neomycin phosphotransferase (NPT) II reporter gene fused to various promoters. Some of the chimeric ""neo"" genes were shown to yield reproducibly NPT II activity in germinating embryos. This NPT II activity was increased markedly when the neo genes were carried by a vector capable of autonomous replication. Dimers of wheat dwarf virus, a monopartite gemini virus, were thus shown to be effective in amplifying the transient expressed NPT II activity in embryos of several cereals. These and other observations indicate that the observed transient expression really results from DNA uptake and expression in plant embryo cells and is not due to contaminating microorganisms."
"2583082","articletitle","Phytochrome activation of two nuclear genes requires cytoplasmic protein synthesis."
"2583082","abstracttext","We have investigated the effects of protein synthesis inhibitors on light-induced expression of two plant nuclear genes, Cab and rbcS, in wheat, pea and transgenic tobacco. Light activation of these two genes is very sensitive to cycloheximide, an inhibitor of cytoplasmic protein synthesis but not to chloramphenicol, an inhibitor of organellar protein synthesis. Studies with chimeric gene constructs in transgenic tobacco seedlings show that cycloheximide exerts its effect at the transcriptional level. As a control, we show that the expression of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter is enhanced by cycloheximide treatment, irrespective of the coding sequence used. Escape-time analyses with green wheat seedlings show that the cycloheximide block for Cab gene expression is after the primary signal transduction step linked to phytochrome photoconversion. Our results suggest that phytochrome activation of Cab and rbcS is mediated by a labile protein factor(s) synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes."

"1714320","abstracttext","A cDNA (WPRP1) encoding a wheat proline-rich protein has been isolated and sequenced. The amino acid composition shows 45% proline, with high levels of methionine, lysine and glutamic acid. The derived 378 residue amino acid sequence has a highly repetitive structure which is unlike those of other proline-rich proteins. The WPRP1 cDNA clone was used to determine the copy number and chromosomal location of the WPRP1 gene by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of wheat inbred lines. Although WPRP1 is encoded by a single-copy gene it is also a representative of a larger family of related sequences. RNA gel blot analysis showed that expression of WPRP1 is highest in rapidly growing tissue which together with its amino acid composition suggests a structural role for the encoded protein."

"1848669","abstracttext","To investigate transcriptional mechanisms in plant mitochondria, we have developed an accurate and efficient in vitro transcription system consisting of a partially purified wheat mitochondrial extract programmed with cloned DNA templates containing the promoter for the wheat mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit II gene (coxII).

We show that in vitro transcription of coxII is initiated at position -170, precisely the same site at which transcription is initiated in vivo. Transcription begins within the sequence GTATAGTAAGTA (the initiating nucleotide is underlined), which is similar to the consensus yeast mitochondrial promoter motif, (A/T)TATAAGTA. This is the first in vitro system that faithfully reproduces in vivo transcription of a plant mitochondrial gene."

"1859869","abstracttext","The transcription of thirteen Arabidopsis tRNA(Tyr) genes in a tRNA gene cluster was studied in HeLa cell nuclear extracts. All tRNA(Tyr) genes are efficiently transcribed. Initiation of transcription starts at adenosine residues at positions -5 or -6, and termination occurs at an oligo(T) stretch located 17 to 21 bp downstream of the 3' end of the structural genes depending on the gene studied. Maturation of intron-containing pre-tRNAs was compared in HeLa cell and wheat germ extracts and revealed that 5' and 3' end processing precedes splicing in both systems. Two pre-tRNAs which carry mutations in the mature domain are not processed at all in the HeLa extract, whereas one of them matures with low efficiency in the wheat germ extract. The thirteen pre-tRNAs(Tyr) possess highly conserved intron sequences of 12 nucleotides. Twelve of these introns are efficiently excised, whereas one is removed at a reduced rate, possibly due to a slightly destabilized extended anticodon stem."

"7811976","abstracttext","We report here the isolation and nucleotide sequence of genomic clones encoding the chloroplast enzyme sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase) from Arabidopsis thaliana. The coding region of this gene contains eight exons (72-76 bp) and seven introns (75-91 bp) and encodes a polypeptide of 393 amino acids. Unusually, the 5' non-coding region contains two additional AUG codons upstream of the translation initiation codon. A comparison of the deduced Arabidopsis and wheat SBPase polypeptide sequences reveals 78.6%, identity. Expression studies showed that the level of SBPase mRNA in Arabidopsis and wheat is regulated in a light-dependent manner and is also influenced by the developmental stage of the leaf. Although the Arabidopsis SBPase gene is present in a single copy, two hybridizing transcripts were detected in some tissues, suggesting the presence of alternate transcription start sites in the upstream region."

The addition of Xenopus oocyte, yeast, or wheat germ 5S RNA as footprint competitors reveals that factor A binds these 5S RNAs with similar affinity. In contrast, factor A does not bind to E.coli 5S RNA or wheat germ tRNA in this assay. Factor A binding to single stranded DNA is also examined using footprint competition. Factor A binds preferentially to non-specific single stranded (M13) DNA versus double stranded (pBR322) DNA. Factor A binds equally well to single stranded DNA fragments containing either the coding or non-coding strands of the 5S RNA gene. Using single stranded M13 DNA as a competitor, the factor A-5S RNA gene complex is found to dissociate with a half-life of 5-6 min."

One cDNA clone probe hybridized strongly to sequences on chromosome 6 but not to those on chromosome 1. The other cDNA clone probe preferentially hybridized to sequences on chromosome 1. It is concluded that structural genes for alpha-amylases are located on barley chromosomes 1 and 6. alpha-Amylase genes on the same chromosome appear to be closely related to one another but substantially different from those on the other chromosome."

Acids Res. 11 (1983) 5865-5865]. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that there are 17 nucleotide replacements in the protein-coding region of two H4 genes, causing only one amino acid substitution: a glycine at position 4 (from the N terminus) in TH011 was replaced by an aspartic acid in TH091. S1 mapping, using total nuclear RNA from germinated seeds, indicated that the H4 gene was transcribed in vivo."

"15966098","abstracttext","We have monitored changes in the chlorophyll a/b-binding protein (Cab) mRNA levels in etiolated wheat leaves exposed to light of different wavelengths by Northern blot hybridizations and 5' S1 nuclease protection assays. Accumulation of the Cab mRNA and the specific Cab-1 transcript is regulated by phytochrome. Transcript levels are elevated by red light and the red enhancement can be partially reversed by far-red light. Moreover, far-red light alone can elicit a small increase in the transcript levels. These characteristic features of the wheat Cab-1 phytochrome response can be recapitulated in etiolated seedlings of transgenic tobacco containing the Cab-1 gene. Analyses of a chimeric construct revealed that a 1.8-kb 5'-flanking fragment (-1816 to +31) of the Cab-1 gene can confer phytochrome response as well as leaf-specific expression on a heterologous coding sequence."

Molecular markers linked to a race T10 loose smut resistance gene were identified using a F6 single seed descent segregating population. A RAPD marker and a RFLP marker were located on opposite flanks of the resistance gene and were shown to be loosely linked. The RAPD marker was converted to a user friendly polymorphic SCAR marker that represented a single genetically defined locus in hexaploid wheat. Using these two bracketing markers simultaneously, the error rate for T10 resistance selection due to crossing-over was reduced to 4%. These markers can be used for a faster and more reliable selection of T10 resistant plants than previous conventional loose smut ratings."
"15102067","articletitle","Interphase chromosomes and the Rabl configuration: does genome size matter?"
"15102067","abstracttext","Summary It is now well established that the cereals share a common gene order or gene synteny. However, the cereal species encompass an enormous range of genome size, with wheat being one of the largest and rice one of the smallest. Here we describe the current state of knowledge of interphase chromosome structure within the cereal species. In wheat and its close relatives, the interphase chromosomes adopt a highly regular Rabl configuration, with the two chromosome arms lying next to each other and the centromeres and telomeres located at opposite poles of the nuclei. By contrast, the chromosomes in most rice nuclei clearly do not show a Rabl configuration. Surprisingly, the chromosomes in the endoreduplicated xylem vessel cells of rice do adopt a Rabl configuration. To explain this observation, we propose that endoreduplication may occur immediately after chromosome segregation in these cells, and that the new chromatin interactions, particularly at the centromeres, in the endoreduplicated chromosomes may stabilize the anaphase chromosome configuration."

"17142017","abstracttext","Many methods are available for total RNA extraction from plants, except the floral organs like wheat pistils containing high levels of polysaccharides that bind/or co-precipitate with RNA. In this protocol, a simple and effective method for extracting total RNA from small and feathery wheat pistils has been developed. Lithium chloride (LiCl) and phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol (PCI) were employed and the samples were ground in microcentrifuge tube using plastic pestle. A jacket of liquid nitrogen and simplified procedures were applied to ensure thorough grinding of the pistils and to minimize the samples loss. These measures substantially increased the recovery of total RNA (approximately 50%) in the extraction process. Reliable differential display by cDNA-AFLP was successfully achieved with the total RNA after DNase treatment and reverse transcription. This method is also practicable for gene expression and gene regulation studies in floral parts of other plants."

"17295124","abstracttext","Whole genome sequencing provides direct access to all genes of an organism and represents an essential step towards a systematic understanding of (crop) plant biology. Wheat and barley, two of the most important crop species worldwide, have two- to five-fold larger genomes than human - too large to be completely sequenced at current costs. Nevertheless, significant progress has been made to unlock the gene contents of these species by sequencing expressed sequence tags (EST) for high-density mapping and as a basis for elucidating gene function on a large scale. Several megabases of genomic (BAC) sequences have been obtained providing a first insight into the complexity of these huge cereal genomes. However, to fully exploit the information of the wheat and barley genomes for crop improvement, sequence analysis of a significantly larger portion of the Triticeae genomes is needed. In this review an overview of the current status of Triticeae genome sequencing and a perspective concerning future developments in cereal structural genomics is provided."

These microsatellite markers were previously mapped to the long arm of the 5D chromosome and their positions were confirmed using Chinese Spring nullitetrasomic Nulli5D-tetra5A and ditelosomic Dt5DL lines.

The wheat cell-free protein synthesis system we have developed is a powerful method for preparation of many different proteins at a time and also for preparation of large amounts of specific proteins for biochemical and structural analyses. Here, we show a method for preparation of the wheat embryo extract useful for the cell-free reactions, by which 5 ml of a high-activity extract is obtained in 4-5 d. We also describe the methods for small- and large-scale protein synthesis by hands-down operations with the use of mRNAs prepared by transcription of PCR products and pEU plasmids harboring the target cDNAs, which need 2-4 d excepting the time required for plasmid preparation."

"19946899","abstracttext","A single C/T difference between gene and cDNA within the 5'-untranslated region of the wheat mtDNA-encoded cox2 (cytochrome oxidase subunit 2) sequence catalyzed the discovery of C-to-U RNA editing in plant mitochondria by a group at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia [Covello and Gray, (1989) Nature 341, 662-666]. Editing of codons specifying essential copper-binding ligands in the Cox2p Cu(A) site provided additional insights about the amino acid residues comprising this site, as well as illustrating the functional importance of editing in wheat mitochondria. Further investigations of RNA editing in plant mitochondria led to the subsequent discovery of a case of mitochondrion-to-nucleus gene (cox2) transfer in soybean, mediated by reverse transcription of edited cox2 mRNA."

"21460118","abstracttext","Sourdough is a very competitive and challenging environment for microorganisms. Usually, a stable microbiota composed of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts dominates this ecosystem. Although sourdough is rich in carbohydrates, thus providing an ideal environment for microorganisms to grow, its low pH presents a particular challenge. The nature of the adaptation to this low pH was investigated for Lactobacillus plantarum IMDO 130201, an isolate from a laboratory wheat sourdough fermentation. Batch fermentations were carried out in wheat sourdough simulation medium, and total RNA was isolated from mid-exponential-growth-phase cultures, followed by differential gene expression analysis using a LAB functional gene microarray. At low pH values, an increased expression of genes involved in peptide and amino acid metabolism was found as well as that of genes involved in plantaricin production and lipoteichoic acid biosynthesis. The results highlight cellular mechanisms that allow L. plantarum to function at a low environmental pH."

"21513220","abstracttext","High molecular weight (HMW) glutenin polypeptides are critical contributors to the visco/elastic properties responsible for the processing characteristics and utilizations of wheat flour. In order to improve bread making quality of flour and produce transgenic plants free of selectable markers, a linear DNA construct consisting of a minimal expression cassette with the HMW-GS 1Bx14 gene was transformed into wheat cultivar Mianyang 19 by microprojectile bombardment. The transformants were selected by PCR instead of herbicidal markers. Seven transgenic plants were identified from a total of 1219 transformants, yielding a transformation frequency of 0.28%. An SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that the 1Bx14 gene was expressed in three T1 seeds of the transgenic plants. Our results demonstrated that it is feasible to obtain marker-free transformants using the linear-expression-cassette-transformation approach coupled with PCR selection."

Significant differences in genetic diversity among populations were defected. Genetic diversity was highest in population on Tian 863-13, a highly resistant variety, whereas genetic diversity was lowest in population on Huixianhong, a highly susceptible variety. Seven populations from seven varieties that carried the common Yr18 resistance gene were clustered as one sub-group at 0.88 similarity coefficient, which showed that resistance gene selection had close relation with pathogen's component. The results of present study can provide a theoretical basis for integrated management of wheat stripe rust and effective deployment of resistance genes in Pst over-summering zones in China."

We have produced a new linkage map for barley, based on a cross between Hordeum vulgare subsp. spontaneum and Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare (Hvs x Hvv), having a higher level of polymorphism than most of the previous barley crosses used for RFLP mapping. Of 133 markers mapped in the Hvs x Hvv F2 population, 69 were previously mapped on other barley maps, and 26 were mapped in rice, maize, or wheat. Two known gene clones were mapped as well as two morphological markers. The distributions of previously mapped markers were compared with their respective barley maps to align the different maps into one consensus map. The distributions of common markers among barley, wheat, rice and maize were also compared, indicating colinear linkage groups among these species."

"24470306","abstracttext","Stripe rust is one of the most serious wheat diseases worldwide. The fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), the causal agent of this disease, is an obligate biotrophic basidiomycete fungus. Numerous studies have shown that dyneins play important roles during fungal growth and propagation. However, knowledge is limited regarding the function of dyneins in Pst. In this study, we cloned the dynein light chain gene PsDLC1 from Pst and characterized its expression. The function of PsDLC1 was determined by heterologous mutant complementation. Expression of PsDLC1 in Aspergillus nidulans partially complemented the defects of the ÎnudG mutant, indicating that PsDLC1 belongs to the dynein light chain LC8 family. In addition, PsDLC1 was identified in Pst using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS). Knockdown of PsDLC1 produces no significant effect on Pst growth and development, indicating that PsDLC1 is unnecessary for Pst infection of wheat."

Microorganisms, including numerous plant-associated bacteria and several fungi, are also capable of producing IAA. The stem rust fungus Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici induced wheat plants to accumulate auxin in infected leaf tissue. A gene (Pgt-IaaM) encoding a putative tryptophan 2-monooxygenase, which makes the auxin precursor indole-3-acetamide (IAM), was identified in the P. graminis f. sp. tritici genome and found to be expressed in haustoria cells in infected plant tissue. Transient silencing of the gene in infected wheat plants indicated that it was required for full pathogenicity. Expression of Pgt-IaaM in Arabidopsis caused a typical auxin expression phenotype and promoted susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000."

Evidence for mainly nonadditive gene effects were observed in the expression of number of fertile spikes and 1000-kernel weight. Although nonadditives contributed to a lesser degree to the gene action, additives seemed to be the most important genetic expression regulating number of spikelets/spike, number of kernels/spike, and number of kernels/spikelet. Except for number of fertile spikes/plant, selection in F2-populations seems to be promising."

A new technique presented here makes use of the fuzzy set logic for the initial gene selection and of the machine learning algorithm AdaBoost to retrieve a set of genes where expression profiles are the most different between the resistant and susceptible classes. As a proof of concept, our method has been applied to the analysis of a gene expression dataset composed of many independent microarray experiments on wheat head tissue, to identify genes that are biomarkers of resistance to the fungus Fusarium graminearum. We used microarray data from many experiments performed on wheat lines of various resistance level. The resulting set of genes was validated by qPCR experiments."

Modern bread wheat experienced similar paleohistory during the last half million year of evolution opening a new hypothesis where the wheat genome is at the earliest stages on the road of diploidization through subgenome dominance driving asymmetry in gene content, gene expression abundance, transposable element content as dynamics and epigenetic control between the A, B and D subgenomes."

To further investigate the wavelength dependence of light-induced CBF14 expression in cereals, we carried out a detailed study using monochromatic light treatments at an inductive and a non-inductive temperature. Transcript levels of CBF14 gene in winter wheat Cheyenne, winter einkorn G3116 and winter barley Nure genotypes were monitored. We demonstrated that (1) CBF14 is most effectively induced by blue light and (2) provide evidence that this induction does not arise from light-controlled CRY gene expression. (3) We demonstrate that temperature shifts induce CBF14 transcription independent of the light conditions and that (4) the effect of temperature and light treatments are additive. Based on these data, it can be assumed that temperature and light signals are relayed to the level of CBF14 expression via separate signalling routes."
"15803288","articletitle","H9, H10, and H11 compose a cluster of Hessian fly-resistance genes in the distal gene-rich region of wheat chromosome 1AS."
"15803288","abstracttext","H9, H10, and H11 are major dominant resistance genes in wheat, expressing antibiosis against Hessian fly [(Hf) Mayetiola destructor (Say)] larvae. Previously, H9 and H10 were assigned to chromosome 5A and H11 to 1A. The objectives of this study were to identify simple-sequence-repeat (SSR) markers for fine mapping of these genes and for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding. Contrary to previous results, H9 and H10 did not show linkage with SSR markers on chromosome 5A. Instead, H9, H10, and H11 are linked with SSR markers on the short arm of chromosome 1A. Both H9 and H10 are tightly linked to flanking markers Xbarc263 and Xcfa2153 within a genetic distance of 0.3-0.5 cM. H11 is tightly linked to flanking markers Xcfa2153 and Xbarc263 at genetic distances of 0.3 cM and 1.7 cM. Deletion bin mapping assigned these markers and genes to the distal 14% of chromosome arm 1AS, where another Hf-resistance gene, Hdic (derived from emmer wheat), was also mapped previously. Marker polymorphism results indicated that a small terminal segment of chromosome 1AS containing H9 or H10 was transferred from the donor parent to the wheat lines Iris or Joy, and a small intercalary fragment carrying H11 was transferred from the resistant donor to the wheat line Karen. Our results suggest that H9, H10, H11, Hdic, and the previously identified H9- or H11-linked genes (H3, H5, H6, H12, H14, H15, H16, H17, H19, H28, and H29) may compose a cluster (or family) of Hf-resistance genes in the distal gene-rich region of wheat chromosome 1AS; and H10 most likely is the same gene as H9."

"16128812","abstracttext","Wheat omega-5 gliadin has been identified as a major allergen in wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis. We have detected seven IgE-binding epitopes in primary sequence of the protein. We newly identified four additional IgE-binding epitope sequences, QQFHQQQ, QSPEQQQ, YQQYPQQ and QQPPQQ, in three patients with wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis in this study. Diagnosis and therapy of food allergy would benefit from the availability of defined recombinant allergens. However, because omega-5 gliadin gene has not been cloned, recombinant protein is currently unavailable. We sought to clone the omega-5 gliadin gene and produce the homogeneous recombinant protein for use in an in vitro diagnostic tool. Using a PCR-based strategy we isolated two full-length omega-5 gliadin genes, designated omega-5 and omega-5b, from wheat genomic DNA and determined the nucleotide sequences. The protein encoded by omega-5a was predicted to be 439 amino acids long with a calculated mass of 53 kDa; the omega-5b gene would encode a 393 amino acid, but it contains two stop codons indicating that omega-5b is pseudogene. The C-terminal half (178 amino acids) of the omega-5a gliadin protein, including all 11 IgE-binding epitope sequences, was expressed in Escherichia coli by means of the pET system and purified using RP-HPLC. Western blot analysis and dot blot inhibition assay of recombinant and native omega-5 gliadin purified from wheat flour demonstrated that recombinant protein had IgE-binding ability. Our results suggest that the recombinant protein can be a useful tool for identifying patients with wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis in vitro."
"16352866","articletitle","Gene expression studies in isolated mitochondria: Solanum tuberosum rps10 is recognized by cognate potato but not by the transcription, splicing and editing machinery of wheat mitochondria."
"16352866","abstracttext","The complex gene expression mechanisms that occur in plant mitochondria, such as RNA editing and splicing, are not yet well understood. RNA editing in higher plant mitochondria is a highly specific process which modifies mRNA sequences by C-to-U conversions. It has been suggested that in some cases this process is required for splicing. Here, we use an experimental model based on the introduction of DNA into isolated mitochondria by electroporation to study organellar gene expression events. Our aim was to compare processing and editing of potato small ribosomal protein 10 gene (rps10) transcripts in heterologous (wheat mitochondria) and homologous (potato mitochondria) contexts. rps10 is a suitable model because it contains a group II intron, is absent in wheat mitochondria but is actively expressed in potato mitochondria, where transcripts are spliced and undergo five C-to-U editing events. For this purpose, conditions for electroporating isolated potato mitochondria were established. rps10 was placed under the control of either potato or wheat cox2 promoters. We found that rps10 was only transcribed under the control of a cognate promoter. In wheat mitochondria, rps10 transcripts were neither spliced nor edited while they are correctly processed in potato mitochondria. Interestingly, a wheat editing site grafted into rps10 was not recognized by wheat mitochondria but was correctly edited in potato mitochondria. Taken together, these results suggest that editing might occur only when the transcripts are engaged in processing and that they would not be available to editing factors outside of a putative RNA maturation machinery complex."

"18943420","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Fusarium fungi, including F. culmorum, cause seedling blight, foot rot, and head blight diseases of cereals, resulting in yield loss. In a screen for potential disease control organisms and agents, Pseudomonas fluorescens strains MKB 100 and MKB 249, P. frederiksbergensis strain 202, Pseudomonas sp. strain MKB 158, and chitosan all significantly reduced the extent of both wheat coleoptile growth retardation and wheat and barley seedling blight caused by F. culmorum (by 53 to 91%). Trichodiene synthase is a Fusarium enzyme necessary for trichothecene mycotoxin biosynthesis; expression of the gene encoding this enzyme in wheat was 33% lower in stem base tissue coinoculated with Pseudomonas sp. strain MKB 158 and F. culmorum than in wheat treated with bacterial culture medium and F. culmorum. When wheat and barley were grown in soil amended with either chitosan, P. fluorescens strain MKB 249, Pseudomonas sp. strain MKB 158, or culture filtrates of these bacteria, the level of disease symptoms on F. culmorum-inoculated stem base tissue (at 12 days post- F. culmorum inoculation) was >/=31% less than the level on F. culmorum-inoculated plants grown in culture medium-amended soil. It seems likely that at least part of the biocontrol activity of these bacteria and chitosan may be due to the induction of systemic disease resistance in host plants. Also, in coinoculation studies, Pseudomonas sp. strain MKB 158 induced the expression of a wheat class III plant peroxidase gene (a pathogenesis-related gene)."
"20084492","articletitle","Genetic analysis of disease susceptibility contributed by the compatible Tsn1-SnToxA and Snn1-SnTox1 interactions in the wheat-Stagonospora nodorum pathosystem."
"20084492","abstracttext","Stagonospora nodorum is a foliar pathogen of wheat that produces several host-selective toxins (HSTs) and causes the disease Stagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB). The wheat genes Snn1 and Tsn1 confer sensitivity to the HSTs SnTox1 and SnToxA, respectively. The objectives of this study were to dissect, quantify, and compare the effects of compatible Snn1-SnTox1 and Tsn1-SnToxA interactions on susceptibility in the wheat-S. nodorum pathosystem. Inoculation of a wheat doubled haploid population that segregates for both Snn1 and Tsn1 with an S. nodorum isolate that produces both SnTox1 and SnToxA indicated that both interactions were strongly associated with SNB susceptibility. The Snn1-SnTox1 and Tsn1-SnToxA interactions explained 22 and 28% of the variation in disease, respectively, and together they explained 48% indicating that their effects are largely additive. The Snn1-SnTox1 interaction accounted for 50% of the variation when the population was inoculated with an S. nodorum strain where the SnToxA gene had been mutated, eliminating the Tsn1-SnToxA interaction. These results support the theory that the wheat-S. nodorum pathosystem is largely based on multiple host-toxin interactions that follow an inverse gene-for-gene scenario at the host-toxin interface, but disease exhibits quantitative variation due to the mainly additive nature of compatible interactions. The elimination of either Snn1 or Tsn1 toxin sensitivity alleles resulted in decreased susceptibility, but the elimination of both interactions was required to obtain high levels of resistance. We propose the use of molecular markers to select against Snn1, Tsn1, and other toxin sensitivity alleles to develop wheat varieties with high levels of SNB resistance."
"20490443","articletitle","Sodium exclusion QTL associated with improved seedling growth in bread wheat under salinity stress."
"20490443","abstracttext","Worldwide, dryland salinity is a major limitation to crop production. Breeding for salinity tolerance could be an effective way of improving yield and yield stability on saline-sodic soils of dryland agriculture. However, this requires a good understanding of inheritance of this quantitative trait. In the present study, a doubled-haploid bread wheat population (Berkut/Krichauff) was grown in supported hydroponics to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with salinity tolerance traits commonly reported in the literature (leaf symptoms, tiller number, seedling biomass, chlorophyll content, and shoot Na(+) and K(+) concentrations), understand the relationships amongst these traits, and determine their genetic value for marker-assisted selection. There was considerable segregation within the population for all traits measured. With a genetic map of 527 SSR-, DArT- and gene-based markers, a total of 40 QTL were detected for all seven traits. For the first time in a cereal species, a QTL interval for Na(+) exclusion (wPt-3114-wmc170) was associated with an increase (10%) in seedling biomass. Of the five QTL identified for Na(+) exclusion, two were co-located with seedling biomass (2A and 6A). The 2A QTL appears to coincide with the previously reported Na(+) exclusion locus in durum wheat that hosts one active HKT1;4 (Nax1) and one inactive HKT1;4 gene. Using these sequences as template for primer design enabled mapping of at least three HKT1;4 genes onto chromosome 2AL in bread wheat, suggesting that bread wheat carries more HKT1;4 gene family members than durum wheat. However, the combined effects of all Na(+) exclusion loci only accounted for 18% of the variation in seedling biomass under salinity stress indicating that there were other mechanisms of salinity tolerance operative at the seedling stage in this population. Na(+) and K(+) accumulation appear under separate genetic control. The molecular markers wmc170 (2A) and cfd080 (6A) are expected to facilitate breeding for salinity tolerance in bread wheat, the latter being associated with seedling vigour."
"21833553","articletitle","Exploiting co-linearity among grass species to map the Aegilops ventricosa-derived Pch1 eyespot resistance in wheat and establish its relationship to Pch2."
"21833553","abstracttext","Introgressions into wheat from related species have been widely used as a source of agronomically beneficial traits. One such example is the introduction of the potent eyespot resistance gene Pch1 from the wild relative Aegilops ventricosa onto chromosome 7DL of wheat. In common with genes carried on many other such introgressions, the use of Pch1 in commercial wheat varieties has been hindered by linkage drag with yield-limiting traits. Attempts to break this linkage have been frustrated by a lack of co-dominant PCR markers suitable for identifying heterozygotes in F(2) populations. We developed conserved orthologous sequence (COS) markers, utilising the Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium) genome sequence, to provide co-dominant markers in the Pch1 region. These were supplemented with previously developed sequence-tagged site (STS) markers and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Markers were applied to a panel of varieties and to a BC(6) F(2) population, segregating between wheat and Ae. ventricosa over the distal portion of 7DL, to identify recombinants in the region of Pch1. By exploiting co-linearity between wheat chromosome 7D, Brachypodium chromosome 1, rice chromosome 6 and sorghum chromosome 10, Pch1 was located to an interval between the flanking markers Xwg7S and Xcos7-9. Furthermore candidate gene regions were identified in Brachypodium (364Â Kb), rice (178Â Kb) and sorghum (315Â Kb) as a prelude to the map-based cloning of the gene. In addition, using homoeologue transferable markers, we obtained evidence that the eyespot resistances Pch1 and Pch2 on chromosomes 7D and 7A, respectively, are potentially homoeoloci. It is anticipated that the COS marker methodology could be used for the identification of recombinants in other introgressions into wheat from wild relatives. This would assist the mapping of genes of interest and the breaking of deleterious linkages to enable greater use of these introgressions in commercial varieties."

"22653669","abstracttext","Leymus mollis, a perennial allotetraploid (2n = 4x = 28), known as American dune grass, is a wild relative of wheat that could be useful for cultivar improvement. Shannong0096, developed from interspecific hybridization between common wheat cv. Yannong15 and L. mollis, was analyzed with cytological procedures, genomic in situ hybridization, stripe-rust resistance screening and molecular marker analysis. We found that Shannong0096 has 42 chromosomes in the root-tip cells at mitotic metaphase and 21 bivalents in the pollen mother cells at meiotic metaphase I, demonstrating cytogenetic stability. Genomic in situ hybridization probed with total genomic DNA from L. mollis gave strong hybridization signals in the distal region of two wheat chromosome arms. A single dominant Yr gene, derived from L. mollis and temporarily designated as YrSn0096, was found on the long arm of chromosome 4A of Shannong0096. YrSn0096 should be a novel Yr gene because none of the previously reported Yr genes on chromosome 4A are related to L. mollis. This gene was found to be closely linked to the loci Xbarc236 and Xksum134 with genetic distances of 5.0 and 4.8 cM, respectively. Based on data from 267 F(2) plants of Yannong15/Huixianhong, the linkage map of YrSn0096, using the two molecular markers, was established in the order Xbarc236-YrSn0096-Xksum134. Shannong0096 appeared to be a unique wheat-L. mollis translocation with cryptic alien introgression. Cytogenetic stability, a high level of stripe-rust resistance, the common wheat background, and other positive agronomic traits make it a desirable donor for introducing novel alien resistance genes in wheat breeding programs, with the advantage of molecular markers that can be used to confirm introgression."

"22768983","abstracttext","Powdery mildew (Pm) caused by the infection of Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) is a worldwide crop disease resulting in significant loss of wheat yield. To profile the genes and pathways responding to the Bgt infection, here, using Affymetrix wheat microarrays, we compared the leaf transcriptomes before and after Bgt inoculation in two wheat genotypes, a Pm-susceptible cultivar Jingdong 8 (S) and its near-isogenic line (R) carrying a single Pm resistant gene Pm30. Our analysis showed that the original gene expression status in the S and R genotypes of wheat was almost identical before Bgt inoculation, since only 60 genes exhibited differential expression by P = 0.01 cutoff. However, 12 h after Bgt inoculation, 3014 and 2800 genes in the S and R genotype, respectively, responded to infection. A wide range of pathways were involved, including cell wall fortification, flavonoid biosynthesis and metabolic processes. Furthermore, for the first time, we show that sense-antisense pair genes might be participants in wheat-powdery mildew interaction. In addition, the results of qRT-PCR analysis on several candidate genes were consistent with the microarray data in their expression patterns. In summary, this study reveals leaf transcriptome changes before and after powdery mildew infection in wheat near-isogenic lines, suggesting that powdery mildew resistance is a highly complex systematic response involving a large amount of gene regulation."
"24373454","articletitle","Durable field resistance to wheat yellow mosaic virus in transgenic wheat containing the antisense virus polymerase gene."
"24373454","abstracttext","Wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV) has spread rapidly and causes serious yield losses in the major wheat-growing areas in China. Because it is vectored by the fungus-like organism Polymyxa graminis that survives for long periods in soil, it is difficult to eliminate by conventional crop management or fungicides. There is also only limited resistance in commercial cultivars. In this research, fourteen independent transgenic events were obtained by co-transformation with the antisense NIb8 gene (the NIb replicase of WYMV) and a selectable gene bar. Four original transgenic lines (N12, N13, N14 and N15) and an offspring line (N12-1) showed high and durable resistance to WYMV in the field. Four resistant lines were shown to have segregated and only contain NIb8 (without bar) by PCR and herbicide resistance testing in the later generations. Line N12-1 showed broad-spectrum resistance to WYMV isolates from different sites in China. After growing in the infested soil, WYMV could not be detected by tissue printing and Western blot assays of transgenic wheat. The grain yield of transgenic wheat was about 10% greater than the wild-type susceptible control. Northern blot and small RNA deep sequencing analyses showed that there was no accumulation of small interfering RNAs targeting the NIb8 gene in transgenic wheat plants, suggesting that transgene RNA silencing, a common mechanism of virus-derived disease resistance, is not involved in the process of WYMV resistance. This durable and broad-spectrum resistance to WYMV in transgenic wheat will be useful for alleviating the damage caused by WYMV."

The ÎFgac1 mutant displayed a drastically reduced growth on agar medium which could be rescued by a cAMP analogon. Furthermore, the ÎFgac1 mutant was unable to produce perithecia on detached wheat nodes. However, artificial conditions like carrot agar allowed perithecia development. Pathogenicity towards wheat was drastically reduced in ÎFgac1 compared to the wild type. Point-inoculated spikelets showed only small lesions but no typical head blight disease symptoms. Fluorescence microscopy using dsRed-expressing strains revealed that the ÎFgac1 strain was unable to develop any complex infection structures like lobate appressoria and infection cushions. Instead, hyphal anastomosis occurs frequently. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the lack of fungal penetration. Hence, the formation of compound appressoria seems to be essential for infection of wheat. Hyphae on flower leaves produced huge amounts of new conidia, thereby circumventing the infection cycle. This abundant sporulation on wheat epidermis was not observed in wild type. Intriguingly, the Fgac1 deletion mutant was able to infect maize cobs as wild type, indicating that cAMP signaling is not important for maize infection. The ÎFgac1 mutant was unable to produce the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol both in vitro and during wheat infection. In this study, we show that cAMP signaling controls important cellular processes such as development of infection structures, pathogenicity, secondary metabolite production and sexual reproduction. For the first time, we show that cAMP regulates the switch from vegetative to pathogenic lifestyle of F. graminearum on wheat."

"25418882","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat and other small grain cereals is a globally devastating disease caused by toxigenic Fusarium pathogens. Controlling FHB is a challenge because germplasm that is naturally resistant against these pathogens is inadequate. Current control measures rely on fungicides. Here, an antibody fusion comprised of the Fusarium spp.-specific recombinant antibody gene CWP2 derived from chicken, and the endochitinase gene Ech42 from the biocontrol fungus Trichoderma atroviride was introduced into the elite wheat cultivar Zhengmai9023 by particle bombardment. Expression of this fusion gene was regulated by the lemma/palea-specific promoter Lem2 derived from barley; its expression was confirmed as lemma/palea-specific in transgenic wheat. Single-floret inoculation of independent transgenic wheat lines of the T3 to T6 generations revealed significant resistance (type II) to fungal spreading, and natural infection assays in the field showed significant resistance (type I) to initial infection. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed marked reduction of mycotoxins in the grains of the transgenic wheat lines. Progenies of crosses between the transgenic lines and the FHB-susceptible cultivar Huamai13 also showed significantly enhanced FHB resistance. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that the tissue-specific expression of the antibody fusion was induced by salicylic acid drenching and induced to a greater extent by F. graminearum infection. Histochemical analysis showed substantial restriction of mycelial growth in the lemma tissues of the transgenic plants. Thus, the combined tissue-specific and pathogen-inducible expression of this Fusarium-specific antibody fusion can effectively protect wheat against Fusarium pathogens and reduce mycotoxin content in grain."

"26797431","abstracttext","In many plant/pathogen interactions, host susceptibility factors are key determinants of disease development promoting pathogen growth and spreading in plant tissues. In the Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease, the molecular basis of wheat susceptibility is still poorly understood while it could provide new insights into the understanding of the wheat/Fusarium graminearum (Fg) interaction and guide future breeding programs to produce cultivars with sustainable resistance. To identify the wheat grain candidate genes, a genome-wide gene expression profiling was performed in the French susceptible wheat cultivar, Recital. Gene-specific two-way ANOVA of about 40Â K transcripts at five grain developmental stages identified 1309 differentially expressed genes. Out of these, 536 were impacted by the Fg effect alone. Most of these Fg-responsive genes belonged to biological and molecular functions related to biotic and abiotic stresses indicating the activation of common stress pathways during susceptibility response of wheat grain to FHB. This analysis revealed also 773 other genes displaying either specific Fg-responsive profiles along with grain development stages or synergistic adjustments with the grain development effect. These genes were involved in various molecular pathways including primary metabolism, cell death, and gene expression reprogramming. An increasingly complex host response was revealed, as was the impact of both Fg infection and grain ontogeny on the transcription of wheat genes. This analysis provides a wealth of candidate genes and pathways involved in susceptibility responses to FHB and depicts new clues to the understanding of the susceptibility determinism in plant/pathogen interactions."

"27491550","abstracttext","In this paper, two transgenic wheat lines, PC27 and PC51, containing the maize PEPC gene and its wild-type (WT) were used as experimental material to study the effects of high temperature on their photosynthetic physiological characteristics and metabolome. The results showed that transgenic wheat lines had higher photosynthetic rate (P n ) than WT under non-stress treatment (NT) and high temperature stress treatment (HT), and more significantly under HT. The change trends of F v /F m , Ð¤ PSII , and q P were similar to P n , whereas that of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) was the opposite. Compared with WT, no differences in chlorophyll content between the transgenic wheat and WT were observed under NT, but two transgenic lines had relatively higher contents than WT under HT. The change trends of Chlorophyll a/b radio, the decreased values of F m , W k , and V j , and the activity of the antioxidant enzyme were consistent with the chlorophyll content. Compared with WT, transgenic wheat lines exhibited lower rate of superoxide anion production, H 2 O 2 and malondialdehyde content under HT, and no significant differences were observed under NT. The expression pattern of the ZmPEPC gene and wheat endogenous photosynthesis-related genes were in agreement with that of P n . Compared with WT, about 13 different metabolites including one organic acid, six amino acids, four sugars, and two polyols were identified under NT; 25 different metabolites including six organic acids, 12 amino acids, four sugars, and three polyols were identified under HT. Collectively, our results indicate that ZmPEPC gene can enhance photochemical and antioxidant enzyme activity, upregulate the expression of photosynthesis-related genes, delay degradation of chlorophyll, change contents of proline and other metabolites in wheat, and ultimately improves its heat tolerance."

"27669224","abstracttext","The function of a wheat starch regulator 1 (TaRSR1) in regulating the synthesis of grain storage starch was determined using the barley stripe mosaic virus-virus induced gene-silencing (BSMV-VIGS) method in field experiments. Chlorotic stripes appeared on the wheat spikes infected with barley stripe mosaic virus-virus induced gene-silencing- wheat starch regulator 1 (BSMV-VIGS-TaRSR1) at 15 days after anthesis, at which time the transcription levels of the TaRSR1 gene significantly decreased. Quantitative real-time PCR was also used to measure the transcription levels of 26 starch synthesis-related enzyme genes in the grains of BSMV-VIGS-TaRSR1-silenced wheat plants at 20, 27, and 31 days after anthesis. The results showed that the transcription levels of some starch synthesis-related enzyme genes were markedly induced at different sampling time points: TaSSI, TaSSIV, TaBEIII, TaISA1, TaISA3, TaPHOL, and TaDPE1 genes were induced at each of the three sampling time points and TaAGPS1-b, TaAGPL1, TaAGPL2, TaSSIIb, TaSSIIc, TaSSIIIb, TaBEI, TaBEIIa, TaBEIIb, TaISA2, TaPHOH, and TaDPE2 genes were induced at one sampling time point. Moreover, both the grain starch contents, one thousand kernel weights, grain length and width of BSMV-VIGS-TaRSR1-infected wheat plants significantly increased. These results suggest that TaRSR1 acts as a negative regulator and plays an important role in starch synthesis in wheat grains by temporally regulating the expression of specific starch synthesis-related enzyme genes."

"28351975","articletitle","Long noncoding miRNA gene represses wheat Î²-diketone waxes."
"28351975","abstracttext","The cuticle of terrestrial plants functions as a protective barrier against many biotic and abiotic stresses. In wheat and other Triticeae, Î²-diketone waxes are major components of the epicuticular layer leading to the bluish-white glaucous trait in reproductive-age plants. Glaucousness in durum wheat is controlled by a metabolic gene cluster at the WAX1 ( W1 ) locus and a dominant suppressor INHIBITOR of WAX1 ( Iw1 ) on chromosome 2B. The wheat D subgenome from progenitor Aegilops tauschii contains W2 and Iw2 paralogs on chromosome 2D. Here we identify the Iw1 gene from durum wheat and demonstrate the unique regulatory mechanism by which Iw1 acts to suppress a carboxylesterase-like protein gene, W1-COE , within the W1 multigene locus. Iw1 is a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) containing an inverted repeat (IR) with >80% identity to W1-COE The Iw1 transcript forms a miRNA precursor-like long hairpin producing a 21-nt predominant miRNA, miRW1, and smaller numbers of related sRNAs associated with the nonglaucous phenotype. When Iw1 was introduced into glaucous bread wheat, miRW1 accumulated, W1-COE and its paralog W2-COE were down-regulated, and the phenotype was nonglaucous and Î²-diketone-depleted. The IR region of Iw1 has >94% identity to an IR region on chromosome 2 in Ae. tauschii that also produces miRW1 and lies within the marker-based location of Iw2 We propose the Iw loci arose from an inverted duplication of W1-COE and/or W2-COE in ancestral wheat to form evolutionarily young miRNA genes that act to repress the glaucous trait."
"28275817","articletitle","Discovery and characterization of two new stem rust resistance genes in Aegilops sharonensis."
"28275817","abstracttext_key message","We identified two novel wheat stem rust resistance genes, Sr-1644-1Sh and Sr-1644-5Sh in Aegilops sharonensis that are effective against widely virulent African races of the wheat stem rust pathogen. Stem rust is one of the most important diseases of wheat in the world. When single stem rust resistance (Sr) genes are deployed in wheat, they are often rapidly overcome by the pathogen. To this end, we initiated a search for novel sources of resistance in diverse wheat relatives and identified the wild goatgrass species Aegilops sharonesis (Sharon goatgrass) as a rich reservoir of resistance to wheat stem rust. The objectives of this study were to discover and map novel Sr genes in Ae. sharonensis and to explore the possibility of identifying new Sr genes by genome-wide association study (GWAS). We developed two biparental populations between resistant and susceptible accessions of Ae. sharonensis and performed QTL and linkage analysis. In an F 6 recombinant inbred line and an F 2 population, two genes were identified that mapped to the short arm of chromosome 1S sh , designated as Sr-1644-1Sh, and the long arm of chromosome 5S sh , designated as Sr-1644-5Sh. The gene Sr-1644-1Sh confers a high level of resistance to race TTKSK (a member of the Ug99 race group), while the gene Sr-1644-5Sh conditions strong resistance to TRTTF, another widely virulent race found in Yemen. Additionally, GWAS was conducted on 125 diverse Ae. sharonensis accessions for stem rust resistance. The gene Sr-1644-1Sh was detected by GWAS, while Sr-1644-5Sh was not detected, indicating that the effectiveness of GWAS might be affected by marker density, population structure, low allele frequency and other factors."

"29566182","abstracttext","Mayetiola destructor (Say) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) is a destructive pest of wheat and is mainly controlled by deploying resistant cultivars. Unfortunately, wheat resistance to Hessian fly is often lost when temperatures rise to a certain level. This study analyzed temperature sensitivity of 20 wheat cultivars that contain different resistance (R) genes. The lowest temperatures at which the percentage of resistant plants fell below 50% in an assay were 18Â°C for 'D6647 H17' (921680D1-7) (containing the R gene H17), 20Â°C for 'Redland' (H18), 22Â°C for '84702B14-1-3-4-3' (H19), 24Â°C for 'Carol' (H3) and 'Sincape90' (H29), 26Â°C for 'Erin' (H5), 'Jori 13' (H20), and 'PI59190' (H28), 28Â°C for 'Joy' (H10), 'KS99WGRC42' (Hdic), 'Karen' (H11), 'Caldwell' (H6), and 'Seneca' (H7H8), 30Â°C for 'KS85WGRC01' (H22) and 'KS92WGRC20' (H25), 32Â°C for 'Molly' (H13), and 34Â°C for 'Iris' (H9). The three cultivars 'H32 Synthetic' (H32), '81602C5-3-3-8-1' (H15), and 'KS93WGRC26' (H26) exhibited the most resistance to temperature increases. The percentages of resistant plants remained above 50% at 36Â°C for these three cultivars, the highest temperature that can be tested without significantly damaging wheat plant growth. The temperature sensitivity of R gene-mediated fly resistance is also strongly affected by genetic background of wheat cultivars that contain a specific R gene. Our data should provide useful information for breeding wheat resistance to control Hessian fly damage in different regions based on historic temperature data."

"30947368","abstracttext","Germination of wheat maximizes phytochemical content and antioxidant activity while altering chemical composition, gluten content, and pasting properties. This study investigated the effect of short-term imbibition on gene expression profiles and the physical and functional characteristics of wheat. Changes in gene expression profiles of wheat during short-term imbibition (0, 16, and 24 hr) were evaluated by DNA microarray analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was carried out to categorize the function of genes with altered expression. Genes related to cellulose and cell wall synthesis were upregulated by imbibition for 16 hr, whereas those associated with polysaccharide catabolism and nucleosome assembly were upregulated in the subsequent 8 hr. The genes related to proteases and gluten were expressed in dry seeds but disappeared after 16 hr of imbibition. Genes encoding Î±-amylase were not expressed in dry seeds whereas those encoding Î²-amylase were expressed in dry seeds and downregulated by imbibition. According to quantitative real-time PCR and enzymatic activity assay, Î±-Amylase expression increased by imbibition and reached a maximum 24 hr after imbibition, with a corresponding increase in enzymatic activity. Pasting properties of flour made from wheat seeds imbibed for different times were decreased when seeds were imbibed for over 16 hr, by examination with Rapid Visco Analyzer. Gluten content did not significantly change until 24-hr imbibition, although expression of genes encoding gliadin and glutenin disappeared by 16-hr imbibition. The data indicated that it was possible to use 16-hr imbibed wheat, with up to the 50% w/w replacement of nonimbibed wheat."

"31237476","abstracttext","Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici causes wheat stripe rust, one of most important diseases of wheat worldwide. High-temperature seedling plant (HTSP) resistance of wheat to P. striiformis f. sp. tritici is one specific type of host resistance, induced by high temperature (HT). Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) play key roles in regulating plant development and signaling networks, but there have been no reports on possible roles played by RLKs in wheat HTSP to P. striiformis f. sp. tritici . In the present study, a leucine rich repeat (LRR)-RLK gene, TaXa21 , with a high homology with rice bacterial blight resistance gene Xa21 , was cloned from wheat cultivar Xiaoyan 6 (XY 6). TaXa21 expression was up-regulated by the exposure to HT (20Â°C) for 24 h at 8 days postinoculation with P. striiformis f. sp. tritici and was induced by ethylene (ET) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). Knocking down TaXa21 using virus-induced gene silencing reduced HTSP resistance to P. striiformis f. sp. tritici compared with the control plants. In addition, the expression level of TaCAT in the H 2 O 2 pathway was induced and TaACO in the ET signal pathway was reduced in the HT-treated TaXa21 -silenced plants. Transient expression of TaXa21 in tobacco leaves confirmed its subcellular localization in plasma membrane, consistent with the prediction from bioinformatics analysis. The transmembrane and kinase domain of TaXa21 can interact with TaWRKY76 in the nucleus and cell membrane, which is different from the localization of Xa21 in rice. The interaction between TaWRKY76 and TaWRKY62 (positively involved in the HTSP resistance of XY 6) were observed. Together, these results indicated that TaXa21 is a RLK associated with TaWRKY76 and TaWRKY62 and functions as a positive regulator of wheat HTSP resistance to P. striiformis f. sp. tritici . Furthermore, the host defense is mediated by the H 2 O 2 and ET signal pathways."

Deletions of sequences located between the two sgRNA in each gene were the most frequent editing events observed for two of the three genes. A comparative assessment of editing frequencies between a codon-optimized Cas9 for expression in algae, crCas9, and a plant codon-optimized Cas9, pcoCas9, showed more consistent results with the vector expressing pcoCas9. Editing of TaNFXL1 by co-expression of sgRNA pair was investigated in transgenic wheat plants.

"32970180","abstracttext","Bacillus cereus 905, one of the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs), is capable of colonizing wheat roots in a large population size. From previous studies, we learned that the sodA2-encoding manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD2) is important for B. cereus 905 to survive in wheat rhizosphere. In this investigation, we demonstrated that deletion of the recA gene, which codes for the recombinase A, significantly reduced MnSOD2 expression at both the mRNA and the protein levels. Through comparison with the wild-type, the ârecA showed a dramatic decrease in cell survival after exposure to 50 Î¼M paraquat or 15 mM H 2 O 2 . Evidence indicated that the recA gene of B. cereus 905 also notably regulated nutrition utilization efficiency, biofilm formation, and swarming motility. The root colonization examination showed that the ârecA had a 1000- to 2500-fold reduction in colonization on wheat roots, suggesting that RecA plays an indispensable role in effective colonization on wheat roots by B. cereus 905. Taken together, the recA gene positively regulates MnSOD2 production and nutrition utilization and protects B. cereus 905 cells against paraquat and H 2 O 2 . Besides, biofilm formation and swarming motility of B. cereus 905 are promoted by RecA. Finally, RecA significantly contributes to wheat root colonization of B. cereus 905.

The two haplotypes differed by extensive DNA sequence polymorphisms between flanking markers as well as by a major insertion/deletion event including ten Germin-Like Protein (GLP) genes in Hope that were absent in Chinese Spring. Haplotype analysis of a limited number of wheat genotypes of interest showed that all wheat genotypes carrying Sr2 possessed the GLP cluster; while, of those lacking Sr2, some, including Marquis, possessed the cluster, while some lacked it. Thus, this region represents a common presence-absence polymorphism in wheat, with presence of the cluster not correlated with presence of Sr2. Comparison of Hope and Marquis GLP genes on 3BS found no polymorphisms in the coding regions of the ten genes but several SNPs in the shared promoter of one divergently transcribed GLP gene pair and a single SNP downstream of the transcribed region of a second GLP."

"32034248","abstracttext","Revealing the genetic factors underlying yield and agronomic traits in wheat are an imperative need for covering the global food demand. Yield boosting requires a deep understanding of the genetic basis of grain yield-related traits (e.g., spikelet fertility and sterility). Here, we have detected much natural variation among ancient hexaploid wheat accessions in twenty-two agronomic traits collected over eight years of field experiments. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 15âK single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was applied to detect the genetic basis of studied traits. Subsequently, the GWAS output was reinforced via other statistical and bioinformatics analyses to detect putative candidate genes. Applying the genome-wide SNP-phenotype network defined the most decisive SNPs underlying the traits. Six pivotal SNPs, co-located physically within the genes encoding enzymes, hormone response, metal ion transport, and response to oxidative stress have been identified. Of these, metal ion transport and Gibberellin 2-oxidases (GA2oxs) genes showed strong involvement in controlling the spikelet sterility, which had not been reported previously in wheat. SNP-gene haplotype analysis confirmed that these SNPs influence spikelet sterility, especially the SNP co-located on the exon of the GA2ox gene. Interestingly, these genes were highly expressed in the grain and spike, demonstrating their pivotal role in controlling the trait. The integrative analysis strategy applied in this study, including GWAS, SNP-phenotype network, SNP-gene haplotype, expression analysis, and genome-wide prediction (GP), empower the identification of functional SNPs and causal genes. GP outputs obtained in this study are encouraging for the implementation of the traits to accelerate yield improvement by making an early prediction of complex yield-related traits in wheat. Our findings demonstrate the usefulness of the ancient wheat material as a valuable resource for yield-boosting. This is the first comprehensive genome-wide analysis for spikelet sterility in wheat, and the results provide insights into yield improvement."

"15588583","abstracttext","Interaction between nucleus and cytoplasm has essential roles in plant development, including that of floral organs. We isolated a wheat homolog Whlp of Arabidopsis HUELLENLOS PARALOG (HLP) gene encoding a mitochondrial (mt) ribosomal protein L14. Transient expression analysis using the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein showed that 50 amino residues located on the N-terminal of the wheat HLP homolog (WHLP) protein acted as a mt-targeting signal (MTS). Expression patterns of the Whlp gene were compared among floral organs of alloplasmic lines of wheat, in which intrinsic cytoplasms were replaced by the cytoplasm of a wild relative Aegilops crassa. In these alloplasmic lines, pistillody (homeotic transformation of stamens into pistil-like organs) is induced by the alien cytoplasm in the absence of nuclear restorer genes. The Whlp transcripts preferentially accumulated in stamens compared with pistils, leaves, and roots. The expression level of Whlp in the pistillate stamens of the alloplasmic lines was similar to that in genuine pistils of both euplasmic lines and fertile alloplasmic lines. The result suggested that the elevated expression of the Whlp gene plays a role in aiding the development of male reproductive organ but not in the determination of its whorl identity. A comparable expression pattern was observed in another nuclear-encoded mt ribosomal protein gene but not in a mt-encoded gene. The different expression patterns of different mt ribosomal protein genes suggest that the abundance of mt ribosomal proteins is differentially regulated in the organ/tissue development in wheat."

Three polypeptides, puroindoline-a, puroindoline-b, and grain softness protein (GSP-1), have been identified as components of friabilin, a biochemical marker for grain softness, and the genes for these polypeptides are known to be tightly linked to the Ha locus. However, this region of the chromosome 5D has not been well characterized and the physical distance between the markers is not known. Separate lambda clones containing the puroindoline-a gene and the puroindoline-b gene have been isolated from an Aegilops tauschii (the donor of the D genome to wheat) genomic lambda library and investigated. Considerable variation appears to exist in the organization of the region upstream of the gene for puroindoline-b among species closely related to wheat. Using in situ hybridization the genes for puroindoline-a, -b, and GSP-1 were demonstrated to be physically located at the tip of the short arm of chromosome 5 of A. tauschii. Four overlapping clones were isolated from a large-insert BAC library constructed from A. tauschii and of these one contained genes for all of puroindoline-a, puroindoline-b, and GSP-1. The gene for puroindoline-a is located between the other two genes at a distance no greater than approximately 30 kb from either gene.

The selected sequences included 12 well-known HKGs representing different functional classes and 20 genes novel with reference to the normalization issue. The expression stability of the 32 candidate genes was tested by the computer programs geNorm and NormFinder using five different data-sets. Some discrepancies were detected in the ranking of the candidate reference genes, but there was substantial agreement between the groups of genes with the most and least stable expression. Three new identified reference genes appear more effective than the well-known and frequently used HKGs to normalize gene expression in wheat. Finally, the expression study of a gene encoding a PDI-like protein showed that its correct evaluation relies on the adoption of suitable normalization genes and can be negatively affected by the use of traditional HKGs with unstable expression, such as actin and alpha-tubulin."
"19232096","abstracttext_conclusion","The present research represents the first wide screening aimed to the identification of reference genes and of the corresponding primer pairs specifically designed for gene expression studies in wheat, in particular for qRT-PCR analyses. Several of the new identified reference genes outperformed the traditional HKGs in terms of expression stability under all the tested conditions. The new reference genes will enable more accurate normalization and quantification of gene expression in wheat and will be helpful for designing primer pairs targeting orthologous genes in other plant species."
"18944409","articletitle","Inheritance and molecular mapping of barley genes conferring resistance to wheat stripe rust."
"18944409","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Most barley cultivars are resistant to stripe rust of wheat that is caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici. The barley cv. Steptoe is susceptible to all identified races of P. striiformis f. sp. hordei (PSH), the barley stripe rust pathogen, but is resistant to most P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races. To determine inheritance of the Steptoe resistance to P. striiformis f. sp. tritici, a cross was made between Steptoe and Russell, a barley cultivar susceptible to some P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races and all tested P. striiformis f. sp. hordei races. Seedlings of parents and F(1), BC(1), F(2), and F(3) progeny from the barley cross were tested with P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races PST-41 and PST-45 under controlled greenhouse conditions. Genetic analyses of infection type data showed that Steptoe had one dominant gene and one recessive gene (provisionally designated as RpstS1 and rpstS2, respectively) for resistance to races PST-41 and PST-45. Genomic DNA was extracted from the parents and 150 F(2) plants that were tested for rust reaction and grown for seed of F(3) lines. The infection type data and polymorphic markers identified using the resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) technique were analyzed with the Mapmaker computer program to map the resistance genes. The dominant resistance gene in Steptoe for resistance to P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races was mapped on barley chromosome 4H using a linked microsatellite marker, HVM68. A linkage group for the dominant gene was constructed with 12 RGAP markers and the microsatellite marker. The results show that resistance in barley to the wheat stripe rust pathogen is qualitatively inherited. These genes might provide useful resistance against wheat stripe rust when introgressed into wheat from barley."

"19082576","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a devastating disease of wheat. Molecular mapping led to the identification of two major FHB resistance QTL, Fhb1 and Qfhs.ifa-5A. The actual function of these resistance genes is still unknown. The resistant line CM82036, the susceptible line Remus and two sister lines from the cross CM82036/Remus were analysed for gene expression. The sister lines show contrasting levels of FHB resistance due to the presence or absence of resistance alleles at Fhb1 and Qfhs.ifa-5A. At anthesis plants were challenged by Fusarium graminearum or water under controlled conditions. At six-time points after inoculation (0-72 h) gene expression of specific wheat floral tissue was analysed by cDNA-AFLPs in two biological replications. Altered expression patterns after F. graminearum inoculation were observed for 164 transcript-derived fragments (TDFs), corresponding to 3.4% of the analysed fragments. Fourteen TDFs, 0.28% of the total analysed fragments, displayed differential expression after fungal attack depending on the genotype; five of these TDFs were differentially expressed between the sister lines and are possibly associated with the possession of Fhb1 and Qfhs-ifa-5A and the FHB resistance level of the genotypes. Sequencing and annotation of these gene tags revealed homologies to a UDP-glucosyltransferase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, Dna-J like protein, pathogenesis-related family protein and to one gene with unknown function providing initial clues for guiding further functional studies on the resistance reaction of wheat against FHB. This work is the first report on differential gene expression between related, resistant and susceptible, wheat lines after F. graminearum attack."

"18214420","abstracttext","'Express', a hard red spring wheat cultivar that has been widely grown in the western United States, is used to differentiate races of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, the causal fungal pathogen of wheat stripe rust. To identify genes conferring race-specific, overall resistance to stripe rust, Express was crossed with 'Avocet S'. The parents and F(1), F(2), F(3) and F(5) populations were tested with races PST-1, PST-21, PST-43, and PST-45 of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici in the seedling stage under controlled greenhouse conditions. Two dominant genes for resistance to stripe rust were identified, one conferring resistance to PST-1 and PST-21, and the other conferring resistance to all four races. Linkage groups were constructed for the resistance genes using 146 F(5) lines to establish resistance gene analog and chromosome-specific simple sequence repeat marker polymorphisms. The gene for resistance to races PST-1 and PST-21 was mapped on the long arm of chromosome 1B, and that conferring resistance to all four races was mapped on the long arm of chromosome 5B. We temporarily designate the gene on 1BL as YrExp1 and the gene on 5BL as YrExp2. Polymorphism of at least one of the two markers flanking YrExp2 was detected in 91% of the 44 tested wheat genotypes, suggesting that they would be useful in marker-assisted selection for combining the gene with other resistance genes into many other wheat cultivars. Knowledge of these genes will be useful to understand recent virulence changes in the pathogen populations."

"23666057","abstracttext","In order to understand the molecular mechanism(s) associated with floret specificity, morphogenetic and disease development of Karnal bunt (KB) pathogen in wheat spikes, host factor(s) was isolated from KB prone susceptible stage of wheat spikes. An orthologue of Kpp2 gene involved in pheromone response and fungal development was isolated from Tilletia indica for analyzing its role in fungal development. The maximum expression of TiKpp2 gene was observed at 14th day and decreased thereafter. To investigate whether the fungus alters the expression levels of same kinase upon interaction with plants, T. indica cultures were treated with 1% of host factor(s). Such treatment induced the expression of TiKpp2 gene in time dependent manner. Host factor(s) treatment tends to increase the myelination in fungal cultures by lowering the sporidial production. Increase in myelination led to impose more pathogenicity levels in the host and prolific multiplication of pathogen inside host causing more damage to developing grains. In silico characterization and protein-protein interaction studies further suggests that isolated gene showed similarity with Ustilago maydis Kpp2 and induction of TiKpp2 might further activate a downstream transcription factor Prf1. The results of present study clearly suggest that host factor(s) derived from wheat spikes provide certain signal(s) which activate TiKpp2 gene during morphogenetic development of T. indica and affect the fungal growth and pathogenicity. In turn it also provides a plausible explanation for floret specificity of KB fungus in wheat."

"25854793","abstracttext","Previous studies have proved that waterlogging stress accelerates the programmed cell death (PCD) progress of wheat endosperm cells. A highly waterlogging-tolerant wheat cultivar Hua 8 and a waterlogging susceptible wheat cultivar Hua 9 were treated with different waterlogging durations, and then, dynamic changes of reactive oxygen species (ROS), gene expressions, and activities of antioxidant enzymes in endosperm cells were detected. The accumulation of ROS increased considerably after 7 days of waterlogging treatment (7 DWT) and 12 DWT in both cultivars compared with control group (under non-waterlogged conditions), culminated at 12 DAF (days after flowering) and reduced hereafter. Waterlogging resulted in a great increase of H2O2 and O2 (-) in plasma membranes, cell walls, mitochondrias, and intercellular spaces with ultracytochemical localization. Moreover, the deformation and rupture of cytomembranes as well as the swelling and distortion of mitochondria were obvious. Under waterlogging treatment conditions, catalase (CAT) gene expression increased in endosperm of Hua 8 but activity decreased. In addition, Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) gene expression and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity increased. Compared with Hua 8, both CAT, MnSOD gene expressions and CAT, SOD activities decreased in Hua 9. Moreover, ascorbic acid and mannitol relieve the intensifying of PCD processes in Hua 8 endosperm cells induced by waterlogging. These results indicate that ROS have important roles in the PCD of endosperm cells, the changes both CAT, MnSOD gene expressions and CAT, SOD activities directly affected the accumulation of ROS in two different wheat cultivars under waterlogging, ultimately led to the PCD acceleration of endosperm."

"28539970","abstracttext_background","The main aim of this study was to improve fungal resistance in bread wheat via transgenesis. Transgenic wheat plants harboring barley chitinase ( chi26 ) gene, driven by maize ubi promoter, were obtained using biolistic bombardment, whereas the herbicide resistance gene, bar, driven by the CaMV 35S promoter was used as a selectable marker."
"28539970","abstracttext_results","Molecular analysis confirmed the integration, copy number, and the level of expression of the chi26 gene in four independent transgenic events. Chitinase enzyme activity was detected using a standard enzymatic assay. The expression levels of chi26 gene in the different transgenic lines, compared to their respective controls, were determined using qRT-PCR. The transgene was silenced in some transgenic families across generations. Gene silencing in the present study seemed to be random and irreversible. The homozygous transgenic plants of T4, T5, T6, T8, and T9 generations were tested in the field for five growing seasons to evaluate their resistance against rusts and powdery mildew. The results indicated high chitinase activity at T0 and high transgene expression levels in few transgenic families. This resulted in high resistance against wheat rusts and powdery mildew under field conditions. It was indicated by proximate and chemical analyses that one of the transgenic families and the non-transgenic line were substantially equivalent."

"29666883","abstracttext_key message","NGS-assisted super pooling emerging as powerful tool to accelerate gene mapping and haplotype association analysis within target region uncovering specific linkage SNPs or alleles for marker-assisted gene pyramiding. Conventional gene mapping methods to identify genes associated with important agronomic traits require significant amounts of financial support and time. Here, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based mapping approach, RNA-Seq and SNP array assisted super pooling analysis, was used for rapid mining of a candidate genomic region for stripe rust resistance gene Yr26 that has been widely used in wheat breeding programs in China. Large DNA and RNA super-pools were genotyped by Wheat SNP Array and sequenced by Illumina HiSeq, respectively. Hundreds of thousands of SNPs were identified and then filtered by multiple filtering criteria. Among selected SNPs, over 900 were found within an overlapping interval of less than 30Â Mb as the Yr26 candidate genomic region in the centromeric region of chromosome arm 1BL. The 235 chromosome-specific SNPs were converted into KASP assays to validate the Yr26 interval in different genetic populations. Using a high-resolution mapping population (>â30,000 gametes), we confined Yr26 to a 0.003-cM interval. The Yr26 target region was anchored to the common wheat IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 and wild emmer WEWSeq v.1.0 sequences, from which 488 and 454Â kb fragments were obtained. Several candidate genes were identified in the target genomic region, but there was no typical resistance gene in either genome region. Haplotype analysis identified specific SNPs linked to Yr26 and developed robust and breeder-friendly KASP markers. This integration strategy can be applied to accelerate generating many markers closely linked to target genes/QTL for a trait of interest in wheat and other polyploid species."

The HMW-GS deletion was stably inherited as a dominant and conformed to Mendel's laws. Expression levels of HMW-GS were determined by RT-PCR and epigenetic changes in methylation patterns and small RNAs were analyzed.

The total protein content was not significantly affected as the total gliadin content increased in LH-11 compared to WT. Deletion of HMW-GS also changed the content of different gliadin fractions. The ratio of Ï-gliadin increased, whereas Î±/Î²- and Î³-gliadins declined in LH-11.

In the present study, a set of 92 wheat recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross between NI5439âÃâHD2012 were used to identify QTLs associated with leaf rolling under moisture stress condition. Linkage map was constructed using Axiom 35Â K Breeder's SNP Array and microsatellite (SSR) markers. A linkage map with 3661 markers comprising 3589 SNP and 72 SSR markers spanning 22,275.01Â cM in length across 21 wheat chromosomes was constructed. QTL analysis for leaf rolling trait under moisture stress condition revealed 12 QTLs on chromosomes 1B, 2A, 2B, 2D, 3A, 4A, 4B, 5D, and 6B. A stable QTL Qlr.nhv-5D.2 was identified on 5D chromosome flanked by SNP marker interval AX-94892575-AX-95124447 (5D:338665301-5D:410952987). Genetic and physical map integration in the confidence intervals of Qlr.nhv-5D.2 revealed 14 putative candidate genes for drought tolerance which was narrowed down to six genes based on in-silico analysis. Comparative study of leaf rolling genes in rice viz., NRL1, OsZHD1, Roc5, and OsHB3 on wheat genome revealed five genes on chromosome 5D. Out of the identified genes, TraesCS5D02G253100 falls exactly in the QTL Qlr.nhv-5D.2 interval and showed 96.9% identity with OsZHD1. Two genes similar to OsHB3 viz. TraesCS5D02G052300 and TraesCS5D02G385300 exhibiting 85.6% and 91.8% identity; one gene TraesCS5D02G320600 having 83.9% identity with Roc5 gene; and one gene TraesCS5D02G102600 showing 100% identity with NRL1 gene were also identified, however, these genes are located outside Qlr.nhv-5D.2 interval. Hence, TraesCS5D02G253100 could be the best potential candidate gene for leaf rolling and can be utilized for improving drought tolerance in wheat."

In an effort to elucidate the molecular pathways of ZON production, we present a comparative real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction expression study of seven contiguous genes in the ZON biosynthetic cluster on sterile rice and during wheat and oat infection. Under ZON production on rice, the polyketide synthase (PKS) genes PKS4 and PKS13, alcohol oxidase FG12056 gene, and transcriptional regulator FG02398 gene showed similarly upregulated patterns, whereas the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NPS) FG02394, the K(+) channel beta subunit FG12015, and the protein kinase FG02399 displayed a variant pattern. During the same time period under wheat infection when no ZON was produced, the PKS genes and the NPS were downregulated relative to rice whereas the K(+) channel beta subunit gene FG12015 was markedly upregulated, suggesting that it may play a role in the infection process. This is the first expression study of ZON biosynthetic genes in planta. The results give insight into the regulation and activities of the ZON gene cluster under different experimental systems and suggest a connection between ZON and a K(+) channel that could reveal a novel function for ZON in Fusarium spp."

"2340595","abstracttext","The genes coding for tRNA(Gly), tRNA(His), tRNA(Lys), tRNA(Phe), tRNA(Ser) and tRNA(Tyr) have been identified in Oenothera mitochondrial DNA. Sequence analysis of these genes and their surrounding sequences are presented and compared with other known tRNA genes from plant mitochondria. All six deduced tRNA sequences can be folded into the classical cloverleaf structure model. Only the tRNA(His) gene shows high homology with the corresponding chloroplast gene and thus appears to be derived from a transfer event of chloroplast sequences into the mitochondrial genome. The sequences surrounding this gene, however, show little similarity with the chloroplast genome. The other five deduced tRNAs display a much lower similarity with their chloroplast counterparts and thus appear to be genuine mitochondrial tRNAs. These tRNAs are highly conserved between monocots and dicots with maximally three nucleotides differing between the Oenothera sequences and their wheat homologues. A purine-rich sequence is found upstream of each tRNA gene in Oenothera, similar to wheat mitochondrial tRNA genes, that could be involved in transcription signalling."

"4033773","abstracttext","Many of our most important crop plants are monocotyledons, including wheat, corn, rice and barley. No routine transformation system for monocotyledons has been reported, such as the Ti-mediated gene transfer system for dicotyledons facilitated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Indirect evidence suggests that Ti-plasmid DNA is transferred into and expressed in A. tumefaciens-infected wound tissues of plants from Liliaceae and Amaryllidaceae, but these observations have not been extended to monocotyledons of greatest agricultural importance. Regeneration of monocotyledons is usually blocked at the callus-stage, further complicating the possibility of exploring the regulated expression of their genes, and thus preventing identification of the regulatory domains of monocotyledonous genes in a homologous nuclear background. To circumvent these difficulties, we investigated whether monocotyledonous genes can be expressed and correctly regulated in dicotyledons. We have introduced a wheat gene (whAB1.6) encoding the major chlorophyll a/b binding protein (Cab) of the light-harvesting complex into the genomes of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum SR1) and petunia (Petunia hybrida) via a Ti-DNA-mediated gene transfer system which allows the transformed cells to regenerate into whole plants. Here we report for the first time the light-regulated and organ-specific expression of a monocotyledonous gene in transgenic dicotyledonous plants."

Comparison of the gene sequence obtained with that of a wheat cDNA clone revealed the presence of three introns, each less than 100 bases in length. One of these introns lies in a region that may be involved in the light activation of FBPase catalytic activity. Chimeric gene constructs comprising 1673 bp of the upstream FBPase promoter region in a transcriptional fusion to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene were used to investigate expression in transgenic tobacco plants. Histochemical localization of GUS activity revealed high levels of expression driven by the FBPase promoter sequences in photosynthetically active tissues and, unexpectedly, also in the meristematic regions of shoots, lateral buds and roots. The biological significance of FBPase expression in meristematic regions is not yet clear but this pattern of expression may be explained by the presence in the FBPase promoter of a short DNA sequence motif which is also found in the CaMV 35S viral promoter."

"8078764","abstracttext","The pool of partially and completely edited mRNAs present in plant mitochondria could potentially be translated into a mixture of divergent proteins. This possibility was investigated for the nad9 gene in potato by characterization of the mRNA population and the corresponding protein sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence of the nad9 gene product has significant similarity to the nuclear-encoded 30 kDa subunit of the bovine and Neurospora NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) and to the chloroplast ndhJ gene product. Immunoprecipitation of a 27 kDa in-organello 35S labelled mitochondrial translation product with an antibody directed against the wheat nad9 gene product demonstrates its functional expression in potato and wheat. Comparison of the nad9 genomic DNA and cDNA sequences reveals seven codons to be changed by a C to U RNA-editing. Direct sequencing of RT-PCR products derived from cDNAs of different tissues of potato plants shows the presence of a significant portion of only partially edited nad9 transcripts in the various tissues. Amino acid sequencing of internal peptides of the isolated 27 kDa protein from potato tubers demonstrates homogenous translation products of only completely edited nad9 mRNAs even in the presence of partially edited mRNAs. This result suggests a pretranslational selection between edited and incompletely edited mRNAs in plant mitochondria."

"10527426","abstracttext","A wheat gene, denoted Sbe1, encoding a type I starch-branching enzyme (SBEI) was isolated from a genomic library and shown to comprise 14 exons distributed over a 5.7 kb DNA region. Analyses of kernel RNA by 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5'-RACE) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated a considerable sequence variation at the 5' ends of SBEI gene transcripts. DNA sequence alignments between the 5'-RACE products and the Sbe1 genomic DNA indicated that the first two exons and first intron were differentially processed to generate three classes of the mature transcript. One form of the SBEI gene transcript in 12-day old kernels contained the exon I+II+III combination at the 5' end, whereas other forms differed by inclusion of intron 1 or exclusion of exon II sequences. RT-PCR analysis of Sbe1-uidA::nptII chimeric mRNA produced in transgenic wheat cultured cells confirmed that the isolated Sbe1 was able to produce all three forms of SBEI gene transcripts by alternative splicing of the primary mRNA. The variants of processed Sbe1 mRNA were potentially translated into N-terminal variants of the SBEI precursor with different transit peptide sequences."

"15666155","abstracttext","Following the screening of a suppression subtractive library developed from durum wheat plants exposed to low temperature for 6 h, two early cold-regulated (e-cor) genes have been isolated. These genes, coding putatively for a ribokinase (7H8) and a C3H2C3 RING-finger protein (6G2), were characterized by the stress-induced retention of a subset of introns in the mature mRNA. This feature was dependent on cold for 7H8 and on cold and dehydration for 6G2. When other genes, such as the stress-related gene WCOR410c, coding for a dehydrin (one intron), or a gene coding for a putative ATP binding cassette transporter (16 introns) were analyzed, no cold-dependent intron retention was observed. Cold-induced intron retention was not observed in mutants defective in the chloroplast development; nevertheless treatment with cycloheximide in the absence of cold was able to promote intron retention for the 7H8 e-cor gene. These results suggest that the cold-induced intron retention reflects the response of the spliceosoma to specific environmental signals transduced to the splicing protein factors through a chloroplast-dependent pathway. Notably, when the 7H8 Arabidopsis orthologous gene was analyzed, no stress induction in terms of mRNA abundance and no cold-dependent intron retention was detected. Otherwise, 6G2 Arabidopsis homologous sequences sharing the same genomic structure of the durum wheat 6G2 showed a similar intron retention event although not strictly dependent on stress."

"16028107","abstracttext","A gene encoding a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) putatively orthologous to Pmk1 from Magnaporthe grisea was cloned and characterised from the wheat glume blotch pathogen Stagonospora nodorum. Protein sequence alignments showed the cloned gene, Mak2, is closely related to homologues from other dothideomycete fungi. Expression studies revealed Mak2 is up-regulated during in vitro growth upon nitrogen starvation but is not sensitive to carbon starvation or osmotic stress. Transcript analysis in planta showed Mak2 to be expressed throughout infection and up-regulated during the sporulation phase of the infection cycle. Fungal strains harbouring a disrupted Mak2 gene were created by homologous gene recombination. The mutant strains had a severely altered phenotype in vitro with reduced growth rate and failure to sporulate. Further phenotypic analysis revealed that the mutants had near-normal levels of secreted protease activity, were not hypersensitive to osmotic stress and appeared to have melanin synthesis intact. The mak2 strains were essentially non-pathogenic to wheat leaves. No penetration structures formed and although entry was observed through stomates, the infection rarely continued. The results within this study are discussed within the context of the differences in downstream regulation of the Mak2 MAPK pathway and the cAMP signal transduction pathway in S. nodorum; and differences are compared to mak2 mutant strains in other pathogenic fungi."

Expression analysis in vitro revealed Gox1 to be up-regulated in the presence of methylglyoxal and salt but not affected by starvation conditions. Analysis of Gox1 transcription in planta showed its highest expression was in ungerminated spores and during sporulation, suggesting a role for the glycolytic bypass pathway in sporulation. The gene was inactivated by homologous recombination, resulting in a S. nodorum strain with no detectable glyoxalase I activity. The gox1 mutants exhibited no discernable phenotype, with the exception of being more sensitive to the presence of methylglyoxal. Infection assays demonstrated the mutants retained full pathogenicity and sporulation was unaffected. This is the first report describing the characterisation of a glyoxalase I from a pathogen of any description. The gene has been sequenced, functionally characterised and shown not to be required for the infection of wheat by S. nodorum."

"16243726","abstracttext","The Dof (DNA binding with one finger) proteins are plant specific transcription factors. Dof proteins are apparently encoded by a multiple gene family in higher plants. However, only one Dof gene, WPBF, was reported in wheat. In this study, a member of Dof gene family, TaDof1, was cloned from wheat. TaDof1 encode 291 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 30.348 kDa. At its N-terminal end, a 52 amino acid stretch typical of Dof domain and two serine-rich stretches were observed. Sequence alignment indicated that, in Dof domain, TaDof1 share more than 75% identity with other Dof proteins of different species. TaDof1 was expressed highly in leaves and sheaths, but lowly in roots, and constitutively expressed in developing seeds of 2-12 DAP. It was interesting to note that TaDof1 was differentially expressed between hybrids F1 and parents in root, sheath and leaf. The implication of the differential expression patterns of TaDof1 was discussed in related to the up-regulation of C4 pathway related gene in hybrid rice and heterosis."

"17054088","abstracttext","In wheat, herbicides are used to control weeds. Little is known about the changes induced in the metabolism of tolerant plants after herbicide treatment. The impact of three herbicides [2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), cinidon-ethyl and tribenuron-methyl] on the wheat transcriptome was studied using cDNA microarrays. Gene expression of plants grown in a controlled environment or in the field was studied between 24 h and 2 weeks after treatment. Under controlled conditions, 2,4-D induced genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway soon after treatment. Cinidon-ethyl triggered peroxidase and defence-related gene expression under controlled conditions, probably because reactive oxygen species are released by photo-oxidation of protoporphyrin-IX. The same genes were upregulated in the field as under controlled conditions, albeit at a weaker level. These results show that cinidon-ethyl specifically induces genes involved in plant defence. Under controlled conditions, tribenuron-methyl did not change the expression profile immediately after treatment, but defence-related genes were upregulated after 1 week. Sulfonylurea compounds such as tribenuron-methyl specifically inhibit acetolactate synthase and are rapidly detoxified, but the activity of some of the resulting metabolites could explain later changes in gene expression. Finally, overexpression of the isopropylmalate synthase gene, involved in branched-chain amino acid synthesis, and of defence-related genes was observed in the field after sulfonylurea treatment."

"16592232","abstracttext","In contrast to standard-height wheat genotypes, short-statured wheats having major genes for dwarfness do not show increased seedling growth after treatment with gibberellic acid. Endogenous gibberellic acid induces synthesis of amylase in the endosperm of germinating seeds, but the amount of amylase synthesized is greatly increased by exogenous gibberellic acid treatment in standard-height and in short-statured wheats that have dwarfing genes from the variety ""Norin 10."" ""D6899,"" which has the ""Tom Thumb"" gene for height reduction, had about one-fourth of the amylase activity of standard-height and Norin 10-derived, short-statured wheats. This genotype showed little or no increased amylase activity after gibberellic acid treatment. Genetic analyses showed that the amount of amylase synthesized was controlled by a single gene and was dependent on the number of copies of the structural gene present in the endosperm. Dwarfism in wheat may be related to a blockage in gibberellic acid utilization because other workers have found that the amount of endogenous amylase synthesized in Norin 10-derived, short-statured wheats is not growth-limiting, but it is not known if low amylase synthesis is related to dwarfism in the Tom Thumb derivative. No recombinants were recovered in a small population, suggesting that the Tom Thumb gene may pleiotropically affect plant height and the lack of response to gibberellic acid in amylase synthesis and seedling growth."

"19749360","abstracttext","I have constructed a novel aptazyme-based biosensor system for detecting cofactors of the aptazymes using a cell-free luciferase synthesis in wheat germ extract. In this system, the activity of the aptazyme that is fused to a 5'-untranslated region of a luciferase gene can be detected as luciferase expression. In translating the aptazyme-fused mRNA as-is using a wheat germ cell-free translation system, the luciferase is almost not expressed because of the following triple suppression effects: (1) 5'-terminal three bases and (2) 5'-terminal duplex prevent the ribosome from binding to own mRNA; (3) if the ribosome binds, translation of a mimic gene in the aptazyme inhibits that of the downstream luciferase gene (OFF state). In contrast, in the presence of the aptazyme cofactor, the aptazyme in mRNA is self-cleaved to produce an aptazyme-free luciferase gene, which is translated efficiently (ON state). The ON/OFF efficiency and the detection limit of the aptazyme-based biosensor for theophylline are much higher and lower, respectively, compared to those of previously-reported one that utilizes a prokaryotic translation system."

"19589066","abstracttext","The fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum is the most common agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB) in small grain cereals and cob rot of maize. The threat posed by this fungus is due to a decrease in yield and, additionally, mycotoxin contamination of the harvested cereals. Among the mycotoxins, trichothecenes influence virulence of F. graminearum in a highly complex manner that is strongly host- as well as chemotype-specific. The factors inducing mycotoxin production during plant infection are still unknown. To evaluate the induction of the trichothecene pathway, the green fluorescence protein (GFP) gene was fused to the promoter of the TRI5 gene coding for the trichodiene synthase and integrated into the genome by homologous integration. The resulting mutant contains a fully functional TRI5 gene ensuring virulence on wheat and exhibits GFP driven by the endogenous TRI5 promoter. We are now able to monitor the induction of trichothecenes under real-time conditions. To localize the fungus in the plant tissue, the dsRed gene was integrated under constitutive control of the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpdA) promoter. We are now able to show that, first, induction of GFP as well as trichothecene production in the reporter strain reflects TRI5 induction and trichothecene production in the wild type; second, expression of TRI5 is inducible during growth in culture; and, third, trichothecene production is not uniformly induced during the onset of infection but is tissue specific during fungal infection of wheat."
"20569395","articletitle","The Fusarium graminearum MAP1 gene is essential for pathogenicity and development of perithecia."
"20569395","abstracttext","SUMMARY Fusarium graminearum is the causal agent of ear blight disease of cereals. Infection occurs at anthesis when ascospores and/or conidia directly penetrate exposed anther and ovary tissue. The hemibiotrophic hyphae colonize floral tissues and developing grains to cause premature ear senescence. During infection, Fusarium hyphae can also produce hazardous trichothecene mycotoxins, thereby posing a threat to human and animal health and safety. The Fusarium MAP1 gene was identified using a PCR approach by its homology to a known pathogenicity gene of Magnaporthe grisea, the mitogen-activated protein kinase gene PMK1. Gene replacement F. graminearum map1 mutants were non-pathogenic on wheat flowers and roots, and also could not infect wounded wheat floral tissue or tomato fruits. Unlike the wild-type strain, map1 mutant inoculations did not compromise grain yield. Map1 mutants lost their ability to form perithecia in vitro, but their rate of asexual conidiation was unaffected. DON mycotoxin production in planta was still detected. Collectively, the observed phenotypes suggest that the Map1 signalling protein controls multiple events in disease establishment and propagation. Novel approaches to control Fusarium ear blight disease by blocking perithecial development are discussed."

Knowledge of their chromosome organizations is pivotal for efficient utilization of this important gene pool in germplasm enhancement programs.

The homology of T. junceum chromosomes in 13 wheat addition lines was tentatively established to reveal that homologous groups 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 were represented by HD3515, HD3505, AJDAj11, AJDAj1, and HD3508, whereas groups 1 and 2 were represented by AJADj7-AJDAj9 and AJDAj2-AJDAj4, respectively. AJDAj5 and AJDAj6 had complexly reconstituted T. junceum chromosomes that might have resulted from fusion or translocations of large chromosomal segments from two or more chromosomes, that is (1+5) and (2+5+1), respectively. The identified EST-SSR markers will be useful in comparative gene mapping, chromosome tracing, taxonomic studies, gene introgression, and cultivar identification."

The genetic analysis of the cross Taichung 29/(Taichung 29*6/Strubes Dickkopf) was assessed by inoculating the rust race CYR26 at seedling stage. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) and F2 segregation analysis were used for detecting polymorphic primers to locate the gene. The resistance of the NIL Taichung 29*6/Strubes Dickkopf to CYR26 was controlled by a single dominant gene, named YrSD. The primer pair Xbarc59 on 5B was linked to YrSD and the genetic distance between Xbarc59 and YrSD was 2.4 cM. The molecular marker Xbarc59 closely linked to the gene YrSD could be used in marker-assisted selection for resistance to stripe rust in wheat breeding programmes."

"24166387","abstracttext","A hexaploid wheat landrace collected from the Baluchistan province of Pakistan was found to possess a novel high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS). The subunit has a very slow electrophoretic mobility as revealed by SDS-PAGE, and its molecular weight is comparable to that of the highest molecular weight glutenin subunit (""2.2"" encoded in the D-genome) reported so far in hexaploid wheat varieties and landraces of Japanese origin. Evidence obtained from (PCR) gene amplification studies using the primers specific for Glu-1 loci proved that the gene coding for this novel subunit belongs to the Glu-A1 locus located on the long arm of chromosome 1A. Digestion of the amplified gene (PCR product) with restriction enzymes indicated that the novel gene differs from prevailing Glu-A1 alleles (null, 1 and 2(*)) by an extra DNA fragment of approximately 600 base pairs. The results also indicated that the novel subunit is most probably a derivative of subunit 2(*) that has very likely incorporated the 600-bp fragment following a process of unequal crossing over. The present findings were further substantiated by reserved phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) analysis."

All Gli-B1 and Gli-D1 alleles which differed in encoded Î³-gliadins showed definite RFLP patterns after hybridization with the K32 probe. Two groups of Gli-B1 alleles, Gli-B1b-like and Gli-B1e-like, were identified, and these could originate from distinct genotypes of the presumptive donor of the B-genome. Intralocus recombination and/or gene conversion as well as small deletions, gene silencing and gene amplification were assumed to be responsible for the origin of new gliadin alleles. Silent Î³-gliadin sequences were shown to exist in all of the genotypes studied. K32 also differentiated Gli-A1a from all other Gli-A1 alleles as well as the Gli-B11 allele in cultivars carrying the 1B/1R (wheat/rye) translocation. PTU1 was shown to recognize several Gli-A2 alleles, but not the Gli-B2 or Gli-D2 alleles. Moreover, this probe hybridized to chromosome 1R sequences suggesting the existence of rye gene(s), probably silent, for Î±-gliadin-like proteins on chromosome 1R."

The assay was set up for three target genes to test its validity and applicability. For each gene, three genome-specific primer pairs (one for each genome) with distinct melt curves were developed and multiplexed. This allowed screening for ""single null mutants"" (plants with the target gene deleted in one of the three genomes) for all three genomes in a single reaction. The first two genes (Î±-Amylase 3 and Epsilon Cyclase) were used to test the approach as HIB null lines for all three genomes were already available for these. The third assay was successfully applied to identify new single null lines of the target gene Î±-Amylase 2 in an in-house HIB wheat collection. The use of SYBR Green greatly reduced the time and/or cost investment compared to other techniques and the approach proved highly suitable for high-throughput applications."

"29734518","abstracttext","Sequence-specific nucleases have been used to engineer targeted genome modifications in various plants. While targeted gene knockouts resulting in loss of function have been reported with relatively high rates of success, targeted gene editing using an exogenously supplied DNA repair template and site-specific transgene integration has been more challenging. Here, we report the first application of zinc finger nuclease (ZFN)-mediated, nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ)-directed editing of a native gene in allohexaploid bread wheat to introduce, via a supplied DNA repair template, a specific single amino acid change into the coding sequence of acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) to confer resistance to imidazolinone herbicides. We recovered edited wheat plants having the targeted amino acid modification in one or more AHAS homoalleles via direct selection for resistance to imazamox, an AHAS-inhibiting imidazolinone herbicide. Using a cotransformation strategy based on chemical selection for an exogenous marker, we achieved a 1.2% recovery rate of edited plants having the desired amino acid change and a 2.9% recovery of plants with targeted mutations at the AHAS locus resulting in a loss-of-function gene knockout. The latter results demonstrate a broadly applicable approach to introduce targeted modifications into native genes for nonselectable traits. All ZFN-mediated changes were faithfully transmitted to the next generation."

"29845081","abstracttext","Background: The increasing use of nanoparticles (NPs) may have negative impacts on both organisms and the environment. Objectives: The differential expression of mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase ( MnSOD ) gene in wheat in response to silver nitrate nanoparticles (AgNPs) and AgNO 3 was investigated. Materials and Methods: A quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR experiment was carried out with MnSOD gene using RNAs isolated from wheat shoots treated for 0, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h with 100 mg.L -1 of either AgNO 3 or AgNPs. Results: The results of this study showed that both treatments cause changes in the expression pattern of the MnSOD gene. While 2 and 6 h following the beginning of the stress, MnSOD expression was up-regulated significantly, in response to AgNO 3 (1.4 and 2.8 fold, respectively), in response to AgNPs, it was up-regulated significant only after 6 h (1.6 fold), compared with the control. The gene expression, after 12 h in response to AgNO 3 and AgNPs were downregulated significantly (0.7 and 0.8 fold, respectively), and in the next 12 h , the expression appeared to be similar to the control. Conclusion: Exposure to both AgNPs and Ag ions led to a significant increase in MnSOD expression, but AgNO 3 changed the MnSOD expression faster than AgNPs. Therefore, it is suggested that AgNO 3 has greater penetrability and effectiveness."

"32294096","abstracttext","We used three approaches to map the yellow rust resistance gene Yr7 and identify associated SNPs in wheat. First, we used a traditional QTL mapping approach using a double haploid (DH) population and mapped Yr7 to a low-recombination region of chromosome 2B. To fine map the QTL, we then used an association mapping panel. Both populations were SNP array genotyped allowing alignment of QTL and genome-wide association scans based on common segregating SNPs. Analysis of the association panel spanning the QTL interval, narrowed the interval down to a single haplotype block. Finally, we used mapping-by-sequencing of resistant and susceptible DH bulks to identify a candidate gene in the interval showing high homology to a previously suggested Yr7 candidate and to populate the Yr7 interval with a higher density of polymorphisms. We highlight the power of combining mapping-by-sequencing, delivering a complete list of gene-based segregating polymorphisms in the interval with the high recombination, low LD precision of the association mapping panel. Our mapping-by-sequencing methodology is applicable to any trait and our results validate the approach in wheat, where with a near complete reference genome sequence, we are able to define a small interval containing the causative gene."

"32656968","abstracttext","Agricultural production is dependent on inputs of nitrogen (N) whose cycle relies on soil and crop microbiomes. Crop diversification has increased productivity; however, its impact on the expression of microbial genes involved in N-cycling pathways remains unknown. Here, we assessed N-cycling gene expression patterns in the root and rhizosphere microbiomes of five oilseed crops as influenced by three 2-year crop rotations. The first phase consisted of fallow, lentil or wheat, and the second phase consisted of one of five oilseed crops. Expression of bacterial amoA, nirK and nirS genes showed that the microbiome of Ethiopian mustard had the lowest and that of camelina the highest potential for N loss. A preceding rotation phase of lentil significantly increased the expression of nifH gene by 23% compared with wheat and improved nxrA gene expression by 51% with chemical fallow in the following oilseed crops respectively. Lentil substantially increased biological N 2 fixation and reduced denitrification in the following oilseed crops. Our results also revealed that most N-cycling gene transcripts are more abundant in the microbiomes associated with roots than with the rhizosphere. The outcome of our investigation brings a new level of understanding on how crop diversification and rotation sequences are related to N-cycling in annual cropping systems."

"32508376","abstracttext","Mutations at the LYS3 locus in barley have multiple effects on grain development, including an increase in embryo size and a decrease in endosperm starch content. The gene underlying LYS3 was identified by genetic mapping and mutations in this gene were identified in all four barley lys3 alleles. LYS3 encodes a transcription factor called Prolamin Binding Factor (PBF). Its role in controlling embryo size was confirmed using wheat TILLING mutants. To understand how PBF controls embryo development, we studied its spatial and temporal patterns of expression in developing grains. The PBF gene is expressed in both the endosperm and the embryos, but the timing of expression in these organs differs. PBF expression in wild-type embryos precedes the onset of embryo enlargement in lys3 mutants, suggesting that PBF suppresses embryo growth. We predicted the down-stream target genes of PBF in wheat and found them to be involved in a wide range of biological processes, including organ development and starch metabolism . Our work suggests that PBF may influence embryo size and endosperm starch synthesis via separate gene control networks."

Large resequencing and pan-genome projects start to reveal a more comprehensive picture of the genetic makeup and the diversity among domesticated cereals and their wild relatives. These technological advancements will have a dramatic effect on dissecting genotype-phenotype associations and on gene cloning. In this review, we will highlight the status of the genomic resources available for various cereal crops and we will discuss their implications for gene cloning. A particular focus will be given to the cereal species barley and wheat, which are characterized by very large and complex genomes that have been inaccessible to rapid gene cloning until recently. With the advancements in genomics and the development of several rapid gene-cloning methods, it has now become feasible to tackle the cloning of most agriculturally important genes, even in wheat and barley."

"31728616","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is a destructive fungal pathogen and a major cause of Fusarium head blight (FHB) which results in severe grain yield losses and quality reduction. Additionally, the pathogen produces mycotoxins during plant infection, which are harmful to the health of humans and livestock. As it is well known that lysine acetyltransferase complexes play important roles in pathogenesis, the roles of the Eaf6 homolog-containing complex have not been reported in fungal pathogen. In this study, a Eaf6 homolog FgEaf6 was identified in F. graminearum. To investigate the functions of FgEaf6, the gene was deleted using the split-marker method. ÎFgEaf6 mutant exhibited manifold defects in hyphal growth, conidial septation, asexual and sexual reproduction. Moreover, the virulence of the ÎFgEaf6 mutant was drastically reduced in both wheat heads and wheat coleoptiles. However, the FgEaf6 gene deletion did not impact DON production. An FgEaf6-gfp fusion localized to the nucleus and a conserved coiled-coil (C-C) domain was predicted in the sequence. Mutants with deletions in the C-C domain displayed similar defects during development and virulence as observed in the ÎFgEaf6 mutant. Moreover, the truncated gene was cytoplasm localized. In conclusion, the FgEaf6 encodes a nuclear protein, which plays key regulatory roles in hyphal growth, conidial septation, asexual/sexual reproduction, and the virulence of F. graminearum. The C-C is an indispensable domain in the gene. This is the first report on Eaf6 homolog functioning in virulence of fungal pathogen."

"31269405","abstracttext","The process of inflorescence development is directly related to yield components that determine the final grain yield in most cereal crops. Here, microarray analysis was conducted for four different developmental stages of inflorescence to identify genes expressed specifically during inflorescence development. To select inflorescence-specific expressed genes, we conducted meta-analysis using 1245 Affymetrix GeneChip array sets obtained from various development stages, organs, and tissues of members of Poaceae. The early stage of inflorescence development was accompanied by a significant upregulation of a large number of cell differentiation genes, such as those associated with the cell cycle, cell division, DNA repair, and DNA synthesis. Moreover, key regulatory genes, including the MADS-box gene, KNOTTED-1-like homeobox genes, GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR 1 gene, and the histone methyltransferase gene, were highly expressed in the early inflorescence development stage. In contrast, fewer genes were expressed in the later stage of inflorescence development, and played roles in hormone biosynthesis and meiosis-associated genes. Our work provides novel information regarding the gene regulatory network of cell division, key genes involved in the differentiation of inflorescence in wheat, and regulation mechanism of inflorescence development that are crucial stages for determining final grain number per spike and the yield potential of wheat."

"31263943","abstracttext","The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae causes one of the most devastating crop diseases world-wide and new control strategies for blast disease are urgently required. We have used insertional mutagenesis in M. oryzae to define biological processes that are critical for blast disease. Here, we report the identification of LEU2A by T-DNA mutagenesis, which putatively encodes 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (3-IPMDH) required for leucine biosynthesis, implicating that synthesis of this amino acid is required for fungal pathogenesis. M. oryzae contains a further predicted 3-IPMDH gene (LEU2B), two 2-isopropylmalate synthase (2-IPMS) genes (LEU4 and LEU9) and an isopropylmalate isomerase (IPMI) gene (LEU1). Targeted gene deletion mutants of LEU1, LEU2A or LEU4 are leucine auxotrophs, and severely defective in pathogenicity. All phenotypes associated with mutants lacking LEU1, LEU2A or LEU4 could be overcome by adding exogenous leucine. The expression levels of LEU1, LEU2A or LEU4 genes were significantly down-regulated by deletion of the transcription factor gene LEU3, an ortholog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae LEU3. We also functionally characterized leucine biosynthesis genes in the wheat pathogen Fusarium graminearum and found that FgLEU1, FgLEU3 and FgLEU4 are essential for wheat head blight disease, suggesting that leucine biosynthesis in filamentous fungal pathogens may be a conserved factor for fungal pathogenicity and, therefore, a potential target for disease control."

"32734813","abstracttext","AC Taber is a hard red spring wheat cultivar that has had long lasting resistance to the leaf rust fungus Puccinia triticina. The objective of this study was to determine the chromosome location of the leaf rust resistance genes in AC Taber. The leaf rust susceptible cultivar Thatcher was crossed with AC Taber to develop an F6 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population. The RILs and parents were evaluated for segregation of leaf rust resistance in five field plot tests and in two seedling tests to race BBBDB of P. triticina. A genetic map of the RIL population was developed using 90,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers with the Illumina Infinium iSelect 90K wheat bead array. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) with significant effects for lower leaf rust severity in the field plot tests were found on chromosomes 2BS and 3BS. The same QTLs also had significant effects for lower infection type in seedlings to leaf rust race BBBDB. The gene on 2BS was the adult plant resistance gene Lr13, and the gene on 3BS mapped to the same region as the adult plant resistance gene Lr74 and other QTLs for leaf rust resistance. Kompetitive allele specific polymerase chain reaction (KASP) assay markers linked to the 2BS and 3BS regions were developed and should be useful for marker based selection of these genes."

"33276523","abstracttext","Previously, studies on RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligases in cereals were preferentially focused on GW2 genes primarily controlling seed parameters in rice and wheat. Here we report cloning two HvYrg genes from barley that share significant homology with rice GW2 gene. In antisense genotypes efficiency of gene silencing varied between genes and transgenic lines: AS HvYrg1 : 30-50% and AS HvYrg2: 20-27%. Reduced activity of both genes altered shoot system with increasing number of side shoots. Changes in leaf width, weight, or plant weight and height reached significant levels in some transgenic lines. Lowering expression of the two barley HvYrg genes caused opposite responses in spike development. Plants with AS HvYrg1 gene construct showed earlier heading time and prolonged grain-filling period, while plants from AS HvYrg2 genotype flowered in delay. Digital imaging of root development revealed that down-regulation of HvYrg1 gene variant stimulated root growth, while AS HvYrg2 plants developed reduced root system. Comparison of seed parameters indicated an increase in thousand grain weight accompanied with longer and wider seed morphology. In summary we conclude that in contrast to inhibition of GW2 genes in rice and wheat plants, down-regulation of the barely HvYrg genes caused substantial changes in vegetative organs in addition to alteration of seed parameters."

"17535443","abstracttext_background","EST-PCR markers normally represent specific products from target genes, and are therefore effective tools for genetic analysis. However, because wheat is an allohexaploid plant, PCR products derived from homoeologous genes are often simultaneously amplified. Such products may be easier to differentiate if they include intron sequences, which are more polymorphic than exon sequences. However, genomic sequence data for wheat are limited; therefore it is difficult to predict the location of introns. By using the similarities in gene structures between rice and wheat, we developed a system called PLUG (PCR-based Landmark Unique Gene) to design primers so that PCR products include intron sequences. We then investigated whether products amplified using such primers could serve as markers able to distinguish multiple products derived from homoeologous genes."
"17535443","abstracttext_results","The PLUG system consists of the following steps: (1) Single-copy rice genes (Landmark Unique Gene loci; LUGs) exhibiting high degrees of homology to wheat UniGene sequences are extracted; (2) Alignment analysis is carried out using the LUGs and wheat UniGene sequences to predict exon-exon junctions, and LUGs which can be used to design wheat primers flanking introns (TaEST-LUGs) are extracted; and (3) Primers are designed in an interactive manner. From a total of 4,312 TaEST-LUGs, 24 loci were randomly selected and used to design primers. With all of these primer sets, we obtained specific, intron-containing products from the target genes. These markers were assigned to chromosomes using wheat nullisomic-tetrasomic lines. By PCR-RFLP analysis using agarose gel electrophoresis, 19 of the 24 markers were located on at least one chromosome."
"17535443","abstracttext_conclusion","In the development of wheat EST-PCR markers capable of efficiently sorting products derived from homoeologous genes, it is important to design primers able to amplify products that include intron sequences with insertion/deletion polymorphisms. Using the PLUG system, wheat EST sequences that can be used for marker development are selected based on comparative genomics with rice, and then primer sets flanking intron sequences are prepared in an interactive, semi-automatic manner. Hence, the PLUG system is an effective tool for large-scale marker development."

"4000958","abstracttext","We have cloned and sequenced a gene for the small subunit (SS) of ribulose bis-phosphate carboxylase-oxygenase from Nicotiana tabacum. The tobacco gene is most closely related to the SS genes from the dicots soybean and pea, and less so to the monocots wheat and Lemna; the deduced amino acid sequence of the mature protein is in all cases more closely conserved than is its chloroplast transit sequence. Unlike the genomic sequences of the two monocots, which have one intron, and the two other dicots, which have two introns, the tobacco gene has three introns. The third tobacco intron lies within a highly conserved region of the protein. Its position coincides with the boundary of a 12 amino acid insertion in the SS genes of higher plants, relative to those of blue green algae. The 5' flanking end of the gene carries 67 bp inverted repeats, which flank a series of eight direct repeats; the direct repeats themselves each carry inverted repeats. The 3' untranslated end of this gene differs by only 2 bp from that of an N. sylvestris SS gene."

"2179872","abstracttext","A novel method of synthesizing a structural gene or gene fragment, consisting of the first synthesis of a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), has been developed. As a preliminary test of this method, four synthetic genes or gene fragments have been synthesized. The first one with 396 base pairs (b.p.) codes for the mature rbcS from wheat, the next two with 370 and 342 b.p. respectively, for two half molecules of a gene for trichosanthin and the last one with 315 b.p. for the N-terminal 1-102 residues of human prourokinase. In all these syntheses, a plus-stranded DNA of the target gene was generally assembled by a stepwise or one step T4 DNA ligase reaction of six oligonucleotides (A, *pB, *pC, *pD, *pE and *pF) of 30-71 nucleotides long in the presence of two terminal complementary oligonucleotides (Ab' and eF') and three short inter-fragment complementary oligonucleotides (bc, cd and de). After purification, the synthetic ssDNA was inserted into a cloning vector, pWR13. The resulting product was directly used to transform a host cell. The structure of the cloned synthetic gene was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis."
"9835566","articletitle","Characterization of the prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase gene (dppIV) from the koji mold Aspergillus oryzae."
"9835566","abstracttext","The koji mold Aspergillus oryzae secretes a prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase (DPPIV) when the fungus is cultivated in a medium containing wheat gluten as the sole nitrogen and carbon source (MMWG). We cloned and sequenced the DPPIV gene from an A. oryzae library by using the A. fumigatus dppIV gene as a probe. Reverse transcriptase PCR experiments showed that the A. oryzae dppIV gene consists of two exons, the first of which is only 6 bp long. The gene encodes an 87.2-kDa polypeptide chain which is secreted into the medium as a 95-kDa glycoprotein. Introduction of this gene into A. oryzae leads to overexpression of prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase activity, while disruption of the gene abolishes all prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase activity in MMWG. The dppIV null mutants did not exhibit any change in phenotype other than the absence of prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase activity, suggesting that this activity is not essential. This loss of activity diminished the number of dipeptides and increased the number of larger peptides present in the MMWG culture broth. These effects were reversed by the addition of purified, recombinant DPPIV from the methylotrophic yeast expression vector Pichia pastoris. Our results suggest that the DPPIV enzyme may be of importance in industrial hydrolysis of what gluten-based substrates, which are rich in Pro residues."
"9634798","articletitle","Expression of multiple eukaryotic genes from a single promoter in Nicotiana."
"9634798","abstracttext","We engineered an expression unit composed of three eukaryotic genes driven by a single plant-active promoter and demonstrated functional expression in planta. The individual genes were linked as translational fusions to produce a polyprotein using spacer sequences encoding specific heptapeptide cleavage recognition sites for NIa protease of tobacco vein mottling virus (TVMV). The NIa gene itself was included as the second gene of the multi-gene unit. The first and third genes, obtained from the TR region of pTi15955, encoded enzymatic functions associated with the mannityl opine biosynthetic pathway. The mannityl opine conjugase gene (mas2) was the first unit of the construct and provided the native plant-active promoter and 5' untranslated regulatory sequence. The third gene (mas1), encoding the mannityl opine reductase, furnished the native 3' untranslated region. Cis-processing of the polyprotein by the NIa protease domain was demonstrated in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysate and wheat germ cell-free translation systems. Tobacco plant cells transformed with the multi-gene unit produced detectable levels of mannopine, mannopinic acid, and their biosynthetic intermediates, deoxyfructosyl-glutamate and deoxyfructosyl-glutamine. This indicates that the polygene construct results in a set of functional enzymatic activities that constitute a complete metabolic pathway."

"12354966","abstracttext","Regulated gene expression of chimeric genes has been studied extensively in electroporated protoplasts. The applicability of these assays is limited, however, because protoplasts are not always physiologically identical to the cells from which they are derived. We have developed a procedure to electroporate DNA into intact and organized leaf structures of rice. Optimization of the new gene delivery system mainly involved eliminating explant-released nucleases, prolonging the DNA/explant incubation time, and expanding the pulse time. Using a [beta]-glucuronidase gene under the control of constitutive promoters, we demonstrated that all cell types within a leaf base were susceptible to electroporation-mediated DNA uptake. Although the technique was initially developed for leaf bases of young etiolated rice seedlings, we proved that it was equally applicable both to other monocotyledons, including wheat, maize, and barley, and to other explants, such as etiolated and green sheath and lamina tissues from rice. Transient gene expression assays with electroporated leaf bases showed that the promoter from a pea light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein gene displayed both light- and chloroplast-dependent expression in rice, and that the promoter from the Arabidopsis S-adenosylmethionine synthetase gene was, as in transgenic Arabidopsis and tobacco, preferentially expressed in cells surrounding the vascular bundles."

"15916909","abstracttext","Resistance to sterol 14alpha-demethylase inhibiting fungicides (DMIs) has been correlated with mutations in the CYP51 gene, which encodes the target enzyme eburicol 14alpha-demethylase. To test the hypothesis that variation in the CYP51 gene explains variation for DMI sensitivity in barley and wheat powdery mildew species, this gene was sequenced from isolates of Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei (Bgh) and f.sp. tritici (Bgt), respectively, which differed in their responses to DMIs in agricultural populations in the UK. Two single-nucleotide mutations in the CYP51 gene, which resulted in the amino acid substitutions Y136F and K147Q, were detected. K147Q is a novel mutation present only in Bgh isolates expressing very high levels of resistance. Sequence analysis of the CYP51 gene from the progeny of a cross between DMI-sensitive and resistant Bgh isolates showed that both mutations segregate with resistance, which is consistent with CYP51 controlling a major portion of DMI resistance. However, genetic analysis of resistance to the DMI triadimenol indicates that mutation of the CYP51 gene is not the only mechanism of resistance operating in B. graminis."
"17406023","articletitle","Two infA gene mutations independently originated from a mutator genotype in barley."
"17406023","abstracttext","Cytoplasmic line 2 (CL2) is a chlorophyll mutant that was selected from a plastid mutator genotype in barley. The dynamics of greening and plastid development of CL2 first-leaf blade contrasts with that of monocots. Previous characterizations of CL2 suggested that this mutant has a delay of plastid gene translation during embryogenesis. We hypothesize that CL2 is a mutant in the infA gene, which encodes translation initiation factor 1 (IF1). Wild-type barley infA gene differs in some nucleotides from that in wheat, but the corresponding IF1 proteins are identical. However, infA from CL2 carries a point mutation, which leads to an amino acid change in IF1 residue 52. One CL2-like seedling selected from a new mutator pool also carries a point mutation in infA gene, this time leading to a change of the universally conserved amino acid residue 32. Both point mutations were T --> C substitutions. We sequenced the complementary DNA of the infA transcripts from the wild type and CL2 and found that the mutation was conserved at the mRNA level. Results strongly suggest that CL2 and CL2-like are infA gene mutants, this being the first time that a mutant phenotype is attributed to infA gene in a higher plant."

"20528945","abstracttext","Pseudomonas fluorescens 2P24 is an effective biological control agent of a number of soilborne plant diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms. Among a range of secondary metabolites produced by strain 2P24, the antibiotic 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG) is the major determinant of its disease-suppressive capacity. In this study, we performed random mutagenesis using mini-Tn5 in order to screen for the transcriptional regulators of the phlA gene, a biosynthase gene responsible for 2,4-DAPG production. The mutant PMphlA23 with significantly decreased phlA gene expression was identified from approximately 10,000 insertion colonies. The protein sequence of the interrupted gene has 84% identity to Hfq, a key regulator important for stress resistance and virulence in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Genetic inactivation of hfq resulted in decreased expression of phlA and reduced production of 2,4-DAPG. Furthermore, the hfq gene was also required for the expression of pcoI, a synthase gene for the LuxI-type quorum-sensing signaling molecule N-acyl-homoserine lactone. Additionally, the hfq mutation drastically reduced biofilm formation and impaired the colonization ability of strain 2P24 on wheat rhizospheres. Based on these results, we propose that Hfq functions as an important regulatory element in the complex network controlling environmental adaption in P. fluorescens 2P24."
"19547658","articletitle","Virus-induced gene silencing, a post transcriptional gene silencing method."
"19547658","abstracttext","Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is one of the reverse genetics tools for analysis of gene function that uses viral vectors carrying a target gene fragment to produce dsRNA which trigger RNA-mediated gene silencing. There are a number of viruses which have been modified to silence the gene of interest effectively with a sequence-specific manner. Therefore, different types of methodologies have been advanced and modified for VIGS approach. Virus-derived inoculations are performed on host plants using different methods such as agro-infiltration and in vitro transcriptions. VIGS has many advantages compared to other loss-of-gene function approaches. The approach provides the generation of rapid phenotype and no need for plant transformation. The cost of VIGS experiment is relatively low, and large-scale analysis of screening studies can be achieved by the VIGS. However, there are still limitations of VIGS to be overcome. Nowadays, many virus-derived vectors are optimized to silence more than one host plant such as TRV-derived viral vectors which are used for Arabidopsis and Nicothiana benthamiana. By development of viral silencing systems monocot plants can also be targeted as silencing host in addition to dicotyledonous plants. For instance, Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV)-mediated VIGS allows silencing of barley and wheat genes. Here we summarize current protocols and recent modified viral systems to lead silencing of genes in different host species."

One of these genes, putatively encoding an arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT), was highly represented in the subtracted library and was of particular interest since previous analyses identified the FDB2 locus as possibly encoding transferase activity. The gene was subcloned and complemented a natural fdb2 mutant. Conversely, disruption of the gene eliminated the ability of F. verticillioides to metabolize BOA. Other genes in the cluster also were assessed using a complementation assay.

"22178764","abstracttext","A genomic bank from Talaromyces thermophilus fungus was constructed and screened using a previously isolated fragment lipase gene as probe. From several clones isolated, the nucleotide sequence of the lipase gene (TTL gene) was completed and sequenced. The TTL coding gene consists of an open reading frame (ORF) of 1083bp encoding a protein of 269 Aa with an estimated molecular mass of 30kDa. The TTL belongs to the same gene family as Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (TLL, LipolaseÂ®), a well known lipase with multiple applications. The promoter sequence of the TTL gene showed the conservation of known consensus sequences PacC, CreA, Hap2-3-4 and the existence of a particular sequence like the binding sites of Oleate Response Element (ORE) and Fatty acids Responsis Element (FARE) which are similar to that already found to be specific of lipolytic genes in Candida and Fusarium, respectively. Northern blot analysis showed that the TTL expression was much higher on wheat bran than on olive oil as sole carbon source. Compared to the LipolaseÂ®, this enzyme was found to be more efficient for the hydrolysis and the synthesis of esters; and its synthetic efficiency even reached 91.6% from Waste Cooking Oil triglycerides."

The combinations of Nor medium for callus induction and Cu2+ medium for regeneration, and Cu2+ medium for induction and R medium for regeneration were superior for biolistic transformation. The calli induced on Cu2+ medium and pre-cultured for 4 d before biolistic transformation, and cultured on R medium after biolistic transformation produced the highest percentage (65%) of transgenic plantlets with the KN2 gene.

"25572231","abstracttext","Although the unique properties of wheat Î±-gliadin gene family are well characterized, little is known about the evolution and genomic divergence of Î±-gliadin gene family within the Triticeae. We isolated a total of 203 Î±-gliadin gene sequences from 11 representative diploid and polyploid Triticeae species, and found 108 sequences putatively functional. Our results indicate that Î±-gliadin genes may have possibly originated from wild Secale species, where the sequences contain the shortest repetitive domains and display minimum variation. A miniature inverted-repeat transposable element insertion is reported for the first time in Î±-gliadin gene sequence of Thinopyrum intermedium in this study, indicating that the transposable element might have contributed to the diversification of Î±-gliadin genes family among Triticeae genomes. The phylogenetic analyses revealed that the Î±-gliadin gene sequences of Dasypyrum, Australopyrum, Lophopyrum, Eremopyrum and Pseudoroengeria species have amplified several times. A search for four typical toxic epitopes for celiac disease within the Triticeae Î±-gliadin gene sequences showed that the Î±-gliadins of wild Secale, Australopyrum and Agropyron genomes lack all four epitopes, while other Triticeae species have accumulated these epitopes, suggesting that the evolution of these toxic epitopes sequences occurred during the course of speciation, domestication or polyploidization of Triticeae."

Our results demonstrated that the hairpin RNA (hpRNA) can efficiently silence the expression level of target gene, and the argonaute protein FgAgo1 and dicer protein FgDicer2 are important in this silencing process. RNAi machinery was not involved in growth, abiotic stress and pathogenesis in F. graminearum under tested conditions. We firstly applied high-throughput sequencing technology to elucidate small RNA (17-40 nucleotides) (sRNA) transcriptome in F. graminearum, and found that a total of forty-nine micro-like-RNA (milRNA) candidates were identified in the wild-type and âFgDICER2, and twenty-four of them were FgDicer2-dependent.

Many plant species are recalcitrant to plastid genome transformation. New selections systems may help to overcome this limitation and to extend the application of this technology. A mutant hemL gene from the photosynthetic cyanobacterium Synechococcus, encoding a gabaculine-insensitive glutamate 1-semialdehyde aminotransferase (GSA), is an efficient selectable marker gene for nuclear transformation of tobacco, alfalfa and durum wheat. Since GSA functions in the plastid, we introduced the mutant hemL gene into the tobacco plastid genome along with the conventional antibiotic resistance aadA gene, in the attempt to develop a new selection system for plastome transformation. Although we were unable to directly regenerate gabaculine resistant transplastomic plants, we demonstrated the functionality of hemL in tobacco plastids by using gabaculine selection in the second and third rounds of in vitro selection that permitted to obtain the homoplasmic state in transgenic plants. Thus, the mutant hemL gene functions as a secondary selection marker in tobacco plastids. Our results encourage further attempts to test gabaculine resistant GSA for plastome transformation of crop plants in which gabaculine has stronger regeneration-inhibiting effects with respect to tobacco."

"32114670","abstracttext","The cellulolytic enzymes from filamentous fungi are widely used for production of biofuels. Molecular biological engineering of fungal strains has been applied to improve the cellulase production in the recent years. The VIB gene affects production of cellulase and known as a new transcription factor. Based on a fast-growing strain Trichoderma orientalis EU7-22, we constructed two recombinant strains that knockout the VIB gene and overexpressed the VIB gene and the effects of the VIB gene on cellulase production under induction conditions were also investigated. Under the condition of induction by avicel and wheat bran, the cellulase activity of the recombinant -VIB strain was almost undetectable, while that of the +VIB strain was greatly improved.

"33193549","abstracttext","Mature grain phytase activity (MGPA) in the Triticea tribe cereals has evolved through gene duplications and neo-functionalization of the purple acid phosphatase phytase gene ( PAPhy ) in a common ancestor. Increased gene copy number of the PAPhy_a gene expressed during seed development has augmented the MGPA in cereals like rye and wheat. PAPhy_a phytase is highly stable and a potent enzyme in feed. However, barley only contains one HvPAPhy_a gene and the MGPA levels needs to be increased to substitute for the addition of microbial phytases to the feed. A substantial increase in MGPA for cisgenic barley was achieved with one extra homozygous HvPAPhy_a insert when the plants were grown in the greenhouse. In the current study, the stability of increased MGPA was confirmed in open field grown cisgenic barley. Furthermore, the gene dose response of phytase cisgenes from three different cisgenic barley plants were horizontally stacked. Cisgenic barley with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 extra HvPAPhy_a inserts demonstrated a perfect positive linear correlation with the level of MGPA. The current study provides new insight into the potential of stacking of cisgenes in crops and suggests cisgene stacking as a versatile strategy for crop improvement."

Promoter sequence analysis reveals motifs found in genes specifically expressed in endosperm and aleurone cells, as well as TATA and other putative functional boxes. 720 bp of the Hv85.1 CMd protein gene promoter, when fused to a gus coding region, were unable to direct GUS activity in the seeds of transgenic tobacco plants. In contrast, the same construction delivered into immature maize kernels by microprojectile bombardment was able to direct expression of GUS in the outermost cell layers of maize endosperm in both a tissue-specific and a developmentally determined manner."

"11935018","abstracttext","The genome of the japonica subspecies of rice, an important cereal and model monocot, was sequenced and assembled by whole-genome shotgun sequencing. The assembled sequence covers 93% of the 420-megabase genome. Gene predictions on the assembled sequence suggest that the genome contains 32,000 to 50,000 genes. Homologs of 98% of the known maize, wheat, and barley proteins are found in rice. Synteny and gene homology between rice and the other cereal genomes are extensive, whereas synteny with Arabidopsis is limited. Assignment of candidate rice orthologs to Arabidopsis genes is possible in many cases. The rice genome sequence provides a foundation for the improvement of cereals, our most important crops."

As a model, we selected and amplified the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene by ribosome display utilizing a wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis system based on binding affinity to its substrate analog, methotrexate, immobilized on agarose beads. After three rounds of selection, the DHFR gene could be effectively selected and preferentially amplified from a small proportion in a mixture also containing competitive genes. Active enzymes were expressed and amplified and by sequence analysis, four mutants of DHFR were identified. These mutants showed as much activity as the wild-type enzyme."

The expression of TaNHX2 was induced in roots and leaves by treatment with NaCl, polyethylene glycol (PEG), cold and abscisic acid (ABA). When expressed in a yeast mutant (deltanhx1), TaNHX2 suppressed the salt sensitivity of the mutant,which was deficient in vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter, and caused partial recovery of growth of delta nhx1 in NaCl and LiCl media. The survival rate of yeast cells was improved by overexpressing the TaNHX2 gene under NaCl, KCl, sorbitol and freezing stresses when compared with the control. The results imply that TaNHX2 might play an important role in salt and osmotic stress tolerance in plant cells."

"2340594","abstracttext","The mitochondrial 18S and 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes of rye, plus a total of about 90 kilobase pairs of flanking DNA, have been cloned and maps of restriction enzyme cleavage sites have been constructed. Like their homologs from hexaploid wheat, the rye genes are closely linked and are part of a three-copy family of recombining repeats (the ""18S/5S repeat""). The rye repeat probably also contains a mitochondrial tRNA(fMet) gene, which the wheat repeat is known to carry. However, despite the overall organizational similarity between the wheat and rye 18S/5S repeats in the immediate vicinity of their coding regions, extensive rearrangement of flanking sequences has taken place during evolutionary divergence of the two species. Our data provide additional support for an emerging picture of plant mitochondrial genomes as evolving much more rapidly in structure than in sequence."
"1391781","articletitle","Sequence and organization of a 7.2 kb region of wheat mitochondrial DNA containing the large subunit (26S) rRNA gene."
"1391781","abstracttext","We report the sequence of a 7.2 kilobase pair DNA fragment containing a copy of the wheat mitochondrial gene (rrn26) that encodes the mitochondrial large-subunit ribosomal RNA (26S rRNA). The mature 26S rRNA was determined by direct RNA sequencing to be 3467 nucleotides long, and to share a 5'-terminal pentanucleotide (5'-AUCAU), thought to be important in post-transcriptional processing, with the wheat mitochondrial small-subunit (18S) rRNA. Two other prominent features of the sequence were noted. First, upstream of rrn26 are located two tandem copies of a 70 base pair element containing a putative mitochondrial promoter motif (TCGTATAAAAA). Second, downstream of rrn26 is a sequence element that, if transcribed, would produce an RNA with a secondary structure resembling that of tRNAs but differing sufficiently from the latter structure to preclude any transcript from functioning normally in translation. These upstream and downstream sequence elements may play a role in the expression of rrn26 in wheat mitochondria."

"2772648","abstracttext","The structure and function of transcription factors of higher plants was studied by isolating cDNA clones encoding a wheat sequence-specific DNA binding protein. A hexameric nucleotide motif, ACGTCA, is located upstream from the TATA box of several plant histone genes. It has been suggested that this motif is essential for efficient transcription of the wheat histone H3 gene. A wheat nuclear protein, HBP-1 (histone DNA binding protein-1), which specifically binds to the hexameric motif, has previously been identified as a putative transcription factor. A cDNA clone encoding HBP-1 has been isolated on the basis of specific binding of HBP-1 to the hexameric motif. The deduced amino acid sequence indicates that HBP-1 contains the leucine zipper motif, which represents a characteristic property of several eukaryotic transcription factors."

"1695731","abstracttext","The complete cDNA sequence corresponding to the wheat coxIII gene transcript (coding for subunit 3 of cytochrome oxidase) has been determined by a method involving cDNA synthesis using specific oligonucleotides as primers followed by PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of the amplification products. In 12 different clones, the same 13 nucleotide modifications have been found as compared to the genomic mitochondrial DNA sequence. Among these modifications, 12 are C----U conversions which change codons identities, thereby increasing the homology between the wheat COXIII protein and the corresponding protein of non-plant organisms. The 13th modification is a silent U----C conversion which seems to be an unfrequent editing eventin plant mitochondria. Homologies can be found between sequences surrounding editing sites in the coxIII transcript and in other wheat mitochondrial transcripts. The presence of such homology suggests that these sequences could base-pair with a common RNA molecule which might be involved in editing site recognition."

"1718611","abstracttext","To identify transcription initiation sites in wheat mitochondria, the nascent 5'-ends of transcripts were specifically labeled by incubation of wheat mitochondrial RNA with [alpha-32P]GTP in the presence of the enzyme guanylyltransferase. After separation of the resulting capped transcripts by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels, individual RNAs were recovered and directly sequenced. Four RNA sequences obtained in this way were localized upstream of the protein-coding genes atpA, coxII, coxIII and orf25. Comparison of mRNA and gene sequences allowed precise positioning of transcription initiation sites for these four genes. Sequence similarities immediately upstream of these sites define a conserved motif that we suggest as a candidate regulatory element in wheat mtDNA. The relationship between this motif and putative mitochondrial promoters in other plant species is discussed."

"8624439","abstracttext","Systemic acquired resistance is an important component of the disease resistance repertoire of plants. In this study, a novel synthetic chemical, benzo(1,2,3)thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester (BTH), was shown to induce acquired resistance in wheat. BTH protected wheat systemically against powdery mildew infection by affecting multiple steps in the life cycle of the pathogen. The onset of resistance was accompanied by the induction of a number of newly described wheat chemically induced (WCI) genes, including genes encoding a lipoxygenase and a sulfur-rich protein. With respect to both timing and effectiveness, a tight correlation existed between the onset of resistance and the induction of the WCI genes. Compared with other plant activators, such as 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid and salicylic acid, BTH was the most potent inducer of both resistance and gene induction. BTH is being developed commercially as a novel type of plant protection compound that works by inducing the plant's inherent disease resistance mechanisms."

We determined partial sequences of both PCR-amplified fragments and designed different primers for the specific amplification of the omega-secalin sequence. One of the new primer sets amplified DNA fragments only in rye and wheat lines carrying chromosome 1R or telosome 1RS; no amplification occurred in either euploid wheats or 1RS deletion lines. This PCR-based method would provide efficient screening for the Sec-1 locus in progeny of wheat lines carrying chromosome 1R."

A. brasilenseCd and Sp245 transformants showed high ACC deaminase activity, similar to that observed in Enterobacter cloacae UW4. The expression of ACC deaminase improved the existing growth promoting activity of Azospirillum. The roots of tomato and canola seedlings were significantly longer in plants inoculated with A. brasilense Cd transformants than those in plants inoculated with the nontransformed strains of the same bacterium. In the case of wheat seedlings, inoculation with A. brasilense Cd transformants did not promote root growth. The difference in plant response (canola and tomato versus wheat) is attributed to the greater sensitivity of canola and tomato plants to ethylene as compared to wheat plants."
"11158536","articletitle","Syringolin reprograms wheat to undergo hypersensitive cell death in a compatible interaction with powdery mildew."
"11158536","abstracttext","We had previously isolated and characterized syringolin A, one of the molecular determinants secreted by Pseudomonas syringae pv syringae that is perceived by nonhost plant species such as rice. Here, we show that syringolin A is recognized by wheat and that it induces the accumulation of gene transcripts and increases protection against powdery mildew when applied before inoculation. Moreover, syringolin A essentially eradicates powdery mildew from infected wheat if applied after inoculation. This curative effect is accompanied by the induction of cell death and the reactivation of pathogenesis-related genes whose transcript levels initially accumulate after powdery mildew inoculation but then decline during the later course of infection. Because syringolin A has no fungicidal activity against a variety of fungi and its action on wheat cannot be mimicked by the fungicide cyprodinil, syringolin A is hypothesized to counteract the suppression of host defense reactions imposed by the pathogen on the colonized cells."

The strategy combined the identification of lines carrying specific deletions using multiplex PCR screening of fast-neutron irradiated wheat populations with the approach of physically mapping the region in the rice genome equivalent to the deletion to reveal its gene content. As a result, we have located the Ph1 factor controlling the euploid-like level of homologous chromosome pairing to the region between two loci (Xrgc846 and Xpsr150A). These loci are located within 400 kb of each other in the rice genome. By sequencing this region of the rice genome, it should now be possible to define the nature of this factor."

"14727148","abstracttext","A BAC library of 30,228 clones with an average insert size of 102 kb was constructed in the grass Brachypodium sylvaticum. Brachypodium has a simple genome, similar in size and repetitive DNA content to that of rice, and is more closely related than rice both to the major temperate cereals wheat and barley, and to the forage grasses. The library represents 6.6 genome equivalents, implying a 99.9% probability of recovering any specific sequence. The library was arrayed onto two high-density colony filters, which were screened with heterologous DNA probes from rice chromosome nine and from syntenous regions of wheat, barley, maize and oat. The construction of Brachypodium BAC contigs revealed that synteny between rice, wheat and Brachypodium was largely maintained over several regions of rice chromosome nine. This suggests that Brachypodium will be a useful tool in the elucidation of gene content in agronomically important cereal crops, complementing rice as a ""grass genome model""."

This assay showed that osmotic medium supplemented with 2,4-D increased the oligo-targeting frequency, and that the repair of a point mutation was more efficient than repair of a single base deletion mutation in cultured scutellum cells of immature wheat embryos. This study provides the first evidence that oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis is applicable to regenerable cultured wheat scutellum cells."

In our study, both WCM variants were widespread and the only eriophyoids found on wheat varieties. The WCM variants were also found on alternate host plants, including some plants not known to host WCM. These results have implications for the control of this pest within Australian cereal crops."

In this study, three, six, and five members of the wheat alpha-expansin (TaEXPA1 to TaEXPA3), beta-expansin (TaEXPB1 to TaEXPB6), and XTH (TaXTH1 to TaXTH5) gene families, respectively, were isolated from a dwarf wheat line. The mRNA expression analysis by real-time RT-PCR indicates that these genes display different transcription levels in different stages/organs/treatments, possibly suggesting their functional roles in the cell wall expansion process. Moreover, the comparison of the expression levels reveals that most of the expansins show lower expression than the XTHs. Finally, we present the analysis of wheat alpha- and beta-expansins and XTH families by expressed sequence tag data mining."

"17766003","abstracttext","Cold acclimation is an adaptive process for acquiring cold/freezing tolerance in wheat. To clarify the cultivar difference of freezing tolerance, we compared mitochondrial respiration activity and the expression profile of alternative oxidase (AOX) genes under low-temperature conditions using two common wheat cultivars differing in freezing tolerance. During cold acclimation, the respiration capacity of the alternative pathway significantly increased in a freezing-tolerant cultivar compared with a freezing-sensitive cultivar. More abundant accumulation of the AOX and uncoupling protein gene transcripts was also observed under the low-temperature conditions in the tolerant cultivar than in the sensitive cultivar. These results suggest that the mitochondrial alternative pathway might be partly associated with the cold acclimation and freezing tolerance in wheat."

"18592282","abstracttext","The Fusarium mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) facilitates fungal spread within wheat tissue and the development of Fusarium head blight disease. The ability of wheat spikelets to resist DON-induced bleaching is genotype-dependent. In wheat cultivar (cv.) CM82036 DON resistance is associated with a quantitative trait locus, Fhb1, located on the short arm of chromosome 3B. Gene expression profiling (microarray and real-time RT-PCR analyses) of DON-treated spikelets of progeny derived from a cross between cv. CM82036 and the DON-susceptible cv. Remus discriminated ten toxin-responsive transcripts associated with the inheritance of DON resistance and Fhb1. These genes do not exclusively map to Fhb1. Based on the putative function of the ten Fhb1-associated transcripts, we discuss how cascades involving classical metabolite biotransformation and sequestration processes, alleviation of oxidative stress and promotion of cell survival might contribute to the host response and defence against DON."

"21977025","abstracttext","Flavonoid pigments are known to accumulate in red grains and coleoptiles of wheat and are synthesized through the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. Flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H) is a key enzyme at a diverging point of the flavonoid pathway leading to production of different pigments: phlobaphene, proanthocyanidin, and anthocyanin. We isolated three F3H genes from wheat and examined a relationship between their expression and tissue pigmentation. Three F3Hs are located on the telomeric region of the long arm of chromosomes 2A, 2B, and 2D, respectively, designated as F3H-A1, F3H-B1, and F3H-D1. The telomeric regions of the long arms of the chromosomes of homoeologous group 2 of wheat showed a syntenic relationship to the telomeric region of the long arm of rice chromosome 4, on which rice F3H gene was also located. All three genes were highly activated in the red grains and coleoptiles and appeared to be controlled by flavonoid regulators in each tissue."

"21802612","abstracttext","To develop strategies for manipulating the level of crop seed dormancy, it is necessary to search for the genes that control dormancy. In this study, we investigated whether wheat and barley homologues of the Arabidopsis dormancy gene DOG1 (Delay of Germination 1), TaDOG1L1 and HvDOG1L1 (respectively), also induce seed dormancy. Because their sequence similarity to DOG1 is low and the tissue-specific expression pattern of DOG1 was not conserved in either of these genes, these genes do not appear to retain the function of DOG1. However, ectopic overexpression of either of these DOG1 homologues in transgenic Arabidopsis markedly increased seed dormancy. Furthermore, dormancy release during dry seed storage in the transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing the Triticeae genes occurred similarly to that in a transgenic line overexpressing DOG1. This evidence demonstrates conservation of the function of DOG1 in both TaDOG1L1 and HvDOG1L1. Thus, these DOG1-like genes in wheat and barley are good candidate transgenes for reducing pre-harvest germination in wheat."

"22634104","abstracttext","The MYB proteins play central roles in the stress response in plants. Our previous works identified a cold stress-related gene, TaMYB56, which encodes a MYB protein in wheat. In this study, we isolated the sequences of TaMYB56 genes, and mapped them to the wheat chromosomes 3B and 3D. The expression levels of TaMYB56-B and TaMYB56-D were strongly induced by cold stress, but slightly induced by salt stress in wheat. The detailed characterization of the Arabidopsis transgenic plants that overexpress TaMYB56-B revealed that TaMYB56-B is possibly involved in the responses of plant to freezing and salt stresses. The expression of some cold stress-responsive genes, such as DREB1A/CBF3 and COR15a, were found to be elevated in the TaMYB56-B-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants compared to wild-type. These results indicate that TaMYB56-B may act as a regulator in plant stress response."

"22675045","abstracttext","Zymoseptoria is a newly described genus that includes the prominent wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici (synonyms Mycosphaerella graminicola and Septoria tritici). Studies indicated that the center of origin of Z. tritici is in the Middle East where this important pathogen emerged during the domestication of wheat. Several Zymoseptoria species have been found on uncultivated grasses in the Middle East, and in this article we describe two new Zymoseptoria species from Iran. These species, isolated from Elymus repens, Dactylis glomerata and Lolium perenne, are named Z. ardabiliae and Z. pseudotritici. Both species were identified by means of morphological characteristics and phylogenetic analyses of a seven-gene DNA dataset. These taxa comprise some of the closest known relatives of the wheat pathogen Z. tritici, confirming the reported close phylogenetic relationship between Z. tritici and Z. pseudotritici."

"21316798","abstracttext","Expansins are proteins that are the key regulators of wall extension during plant growth. To investigate the role of TaEXPB23, a wheat expansin gene, we analyzed TaEXPB23 mRNA expression levels in response to water stress in wheat and examined the drought resistance of transgenic tobaccos over-expressing TaEXPB23. We found that the expression of TaEXPB23 corresponded to wheat coleoptile growth and the response to water stress. The results also indicated that the transgenic tobacco lines lost water more slowly than the wild-type (WT) plants under drought stress; their cells could sustain a more integrated structure under water stress than that of WT. Other physiological and biochemical parameters under water stress, such as electrolyte leakage, malondialdehyde (MDA) level, photosynthetic rate, F(v)/F(m) and Î¦PSII, also suggested that the transgenic tobaccos were more drought resistant than WT plants."

"22227493","abstracttext","Association between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and majority of terrestrial plant species provides many benefits to plants that range from stress alleviation and bioremediation in soils polluted with heavy metals to plant growth promotion and yield quantity. Some non-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi such as, Trichoderma harzianum, are known to enhance the AMF symbiosis with vascular plants. However, information about their role in AMF symbiosis is still limited. Shoots of (Avocet S) wheat seedlings were sprayed with the fungal culture filtrate and gene expression patterns were analyzed in the treated tissues. An increase in the level of mRNA of arbuscular mycorrhizal protein comparing with control was found. The over-expression of this protein in wheat tissues might contribute in initiation of AMF colonization in wheat tissues. The result of this study can spark future researches to elucidate possible role of this protein in the symbiotic interaction mechanisms between soil AMF and various plant roots."

"24166638","abstracttext","An F2 population was established for mapping the two dominant genes for dwarfness (Ddw1) and hairy peduncle (Hp) on chromosome 5R. The location of both genes was shown to be on the segment of chromosome 5RL which was ancestrally translocated and is homoeologous to Triticeae 4L. Hp cosegregated with the wheat gDNA probe WG199, localised in wheat on chromosomes 5AL, 4BL and 4DL. No segregation was observed between the traits hairy peduncle and hairy leaf sheath. The locus for Ddw1 was found to map distally to Hp/Xwg199 but proximal to the isozyme marker Î²-amy-R1. The genetical distances were 5.6 cM between Hp/Xwg199 and Ddw1 and ll.ScM between Ddw1 and Î²-amy-R1, respectively. The map position of Ddw1 suggests that it is homoeologous to the wheat dominant dwarfing gene Rht12, present on chromosome 5AL and linked to Î²-amy-A1."

"24194004","abstracttext","The objective of this study was to identify molecular markers linked to genes for resistance to powdery mildew (Pm) in wheat using a series of 'Chancellor' near-isogenic-lines (NILs), each having one powdery mildew resistance gene. A total of 210 probes were screened for their ability to detect polymorphism between the NILs and the recurrent parent. One of these restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers (Xwhs179) revealed polymorphism not only between the NILs for the Pm3 locus, but also among NILs possessing different alleles of the Pm3 locus. The location of the marker Xwhs179 was confirmed to be on homoeologous chromosome group 1 with the help of nullitetrasomic wheat lines. The linkage relationship between this probe and the Pm3 locus was estimated with double haploid lines derived from a cross between wheat cvs 'Club' and 'Chul' (Pm3b). The genetic distance was determined to be 3.3Â±1.9 cM."

"24226026","abstracttext","Using disomic chromosome substitution lines based on the susceptible wheat cultivar 'Chinese Spring', loose smut resistance of wheat cultivars 'Hope' and 'Thatcher' was shown to be conferred in each case by a single dominant major gene carried on chromosome 7 A ('Hope') or 7 B ('Thatcher'). Partial resistance was determined by genes on an additional eight 'Hope' or seven 'Thatcher' chromosomes, and similarities were evident between the partial resistance genotypes of'Hope' and 'Thatcher'. 'Chinese Spring' exhibited a mean infection value of approximately 50%, indicating a significant level of partial resistance, which was found to be due, in part, to genes on the homoeologous chromosome arms 1 As, 1 Es and 1 Ds, and to cytoplasmic genes. Substitution of the 'Chinese Spring' nucleus into the cytoplasm of Aegilops squarrosa, Ae. variabilis or Ae. mutica resulted in increased susceptibility to Ustilago tritici. Several alloplasmic lines of the resistant wheat cultivars 'Selkirk' and 'Chris' exhibited race-specific susceptibility to U. tritici."

The analysis demonstrated that XM(v) is translocated with respect to the standard wheat genome, and consists of a segment of the short arm of homoeologous group 2 attached to a group 6 chromosome lacking a distal part of the short arm. Lr was located to the region of XM(v) with homoeology to 2S by analysis of a leaf rust-susceptible deletion line that was found to lack the entire 2S segment. Confirmation and refinement of the location of Lr was obtained by analysis of a spontaneous resistant translocation in which a small part of XM(v) had been transferred to wheat chromosome 2A."

"25000899","abstracttext","Î²C1 proteins, encoded by betasatellites, are known to be pathogenicity determinants, and they are responsible for symptom expression in many devastating diseases caused by begomoviruses. We report the involvement of Î²C1 in pathogenicity determination of a mastrevirus. Analysis of field samples of wheat plants containing wheat dwarf India virus (WDIV) revealed the presence of a full-length and several defective betasatellite molecules. The detected betasatellite was identified as ageratum yellow leaf curl betasatellite (AYLCB). No begomovirus was detected in any of the samples. The full-length AYLCB contained an intact Î²C1 gene, whereas the defective molecules contained complete or partial deletions of Î²C1. Agroinoculation of wheat with the full-length AYLCB and WDIV or of tobacco with ageratum enation virus enhanced the pathogenicity and accumulation of the respective viruses, whereas the defective molecules could not. This study indicates that Î²C1 is a pathogenicity determinant for WDIV and can interact functionally not only with begomoviruses but also with a mastrevirus."

"26398785","abstracttext","The atomic force microscope tip was used to progressively abrade the surface of non-cut starch granules embedded in the endosperm protein matrix in grain sections from wheat near-isogenic lines differing in the puroindoline b gene and thus, hardness. In the hard near-isogenic wheat lines, starch granules exhibited two distinct profiles corresponding either to abrasion in the surrounding protein layer or the starch granule. An additional profile, only identified in soft lines, revealed a marked stop in the abrasion at the protein-starch transition similar to a lipid interface playing a lubricant role. It was related to the presence of both wild-type puroindolines, already suggested to act at the starch-protein interface through their association with polar lipids. This study revealed, for the first time, in situ differences in the nano-mechanical properties at the starch-protein interface in the endosperm of wheat grains depending on the puroindoline allelic status."

The gathered phenotypic information will enable a targeted choice of accessions with high value for pre-breeding among this plethora of genetic resources.

"25706289","abstracttext","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles in a vast array of biological processes, including growth and development, defense against viral infection, and responses to environmental changes in plant. Wheat hybrid necrosis is an interesting genetic phenomenon observed frequency and it is lethal or semi lethal, resulting in gradual death or loss of productivity. However, the molecular basis and mechanisms associated with hybrid necrosis in wheat are still not well understood. Here, we report the population and expression profiles of miRNAs in wheat hybrid necrosis. We identified a total of 57 conserved miRNA families as well as 182 putative novel miRNAs. Expression profiling revealed that expression of 49 known miRNAs and 165 novel miRNAs was changed in hybrid necrosis. And the expression levels of some miRNAs and their predicated targets have been confirmed by qRT-PCR. These results indicate that these miRNAs, especially miR159, miR166, miR167 and miR5072 could be involved in the extensive regulation of gene expression in response to hybrid necrosis."

New pathogen genotypes are more aggressive and able to infect previously resistant wheat varieties, leading to rapid pathogen migration across and between continents. We now know the full life cycle, microevolutionary relationships and past migration routes on a global scale. Current sequencing technologies have provided the first fungal draft genomes and simplified plant resistance gene cloning. Yet, we know nothing about the molecular and microevolutionary mechanisms that facilitate the infection process and cause new devastating pathogen races. These are the questions that need to be addressed by exploiting the synergies between novel 21 st century biology tools and decades of dedicated pathology work."
"28808101","articletitle","Increased SBPase activity improves photosynthesis and grain yield in wheat grown in greenhouse conditions."
"28808101","abstracttext","To meet the growing demand for food, substantial improvements in yields are needed. This is particularly the case for wheat, where global yield has stagnated in recent years. Increasing photosynthesis has been identified as a primary target to achieve yield improvements. To increase leaf photosynthesis in wheat, the level of the Calvin-Benson cycle enzyme sedoheptulose-1,7-biphosphatase (SBPase) has been increased through transformation and expression of a Brachypodium distachyon SBPase gene construct. Transgenic lines with increased SBPase protein levels and activity were grown under greenhouse conditions and showed enhanced leaf photosynthesis and increased total biomass and dry seed yield. This showed the potential of improving yield potential by increasing leaf photosynthesis in a crop species such as wheat. The results are discussed with regard to future strategies for further improvement of photosynthesis in wheat.This article is part of the themed issue 'Enhancing photosynthesis in crop plants: targets for improvement'."

"30478363","abstracttext","Vernalisation is the programmed physiological process in which prolonged cold-exposure provides competency to flower in plants; widely found in winter and biennial species, such as Arabidopsis, fruit trees, vegetables and wheat. This phenomenon is regulated by diverse genetic networks, and memory of vernalisation in a life cycle mainly depends on epigenetic mechanisms. However, less is known about how to count winter-dosage for flowering in plants. Here, we compare the vernalisation genetic framework between the dicots Arabidopsis, temperate grasses, wheat, barley and Brachypodium. We discuss vernalisation mechanisms involving crosstalk between phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation modification of key proteins, and epigenetic modifications of the key gene VRN1 in wheat. We also highlight the potential evolutionary origins of vernalisation in various species. Current progress toward understanding the regulation of vernalisation requirements provides insight that will inform the design of molecular breeding strategies for winter crops."

Here, we study 56,342 domesticated hexaploid, 18,946 domesticated tetraploid and 3,903 crop wild relatives in a massive-scale genotyping and diversity analysis. Using DArTseq TM technology, we identify more than 300,000 high-quality SNPs and SilicoDArT markers and align them to three reference maps: the IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 genome assembly, the durum wheat genome assembly (cv. Svevo), and the DArT genetic map. On average, 72% of the markers are uniquely placed on these maps and 50% are linked to genes. The analysis reveals landraces with unexplored diversity and genetic footprints defined by regions under selection. This provides fertile ground to develop wheat varieties of the future by exploring specific gene or chromosome regions and identifying germplasm conserving allelic diversity missing in current breeding programs."
"15161200","articletitle","Validation of a rice specific gene, sucrose phosphate synthase, used as the endogenous reference gene for qualitative and real-time quantitative PCR detection of transgenes."
"15161200","abstracttext","With the development of transgenic crops, many countries have issued regulations to label the genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and their derived products. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) methods are thought to be reliable and useful techniques for qualitative and quantitative detection of GMOs. These methods generally need to amplify the transgene and compare the amplified result with that of the corresponding reference gene to obtain reliable results. In this article, we reported the development of specific primers and probe for the rice (Oryza sativa) sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) gene and PCR cycling conditions suitable for the use of this sequence as an endogenous reference gene in both qualitative and quantitative PCR assays. Both methods were assayed with 13 different rice varieties, and identical amplification products were obtained with all of them. No amplification products were observed when DNA samples from other species, such as wheat, maize, barley, tobacco, soybean, rapeseed, tomato, sunflower, carrot, pepper, eggplant, lupine, mung bean, plum, and Arabidopsis thaliana, were used as templates, which demonstrated that this system was specific for rice. In addition, the results of the Southern blot analysis confirmed that the SPS gene was a single copy in the tested rice varieties. In qualitative and quantitative PCR analyses, the detection sensitivities were 0.05 and 0.005 ng of rice genomic DNA, respectively. To test the practical use of this SPS gene as an endogenous reference gene, we have also quantified the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene in transgenic rice using this reference gene. These results indicated that the SPS gene was species specific, had one copy number, and had a low heterogeneity among the tested cultivars. Therefore, this gene could be used as an endogenous reference gene of rice and the optimized PCR systems could be used for practical qualitative and quantitative detection of transgenic rice."

"21118486","abstracttext_background","Gene silencing vectors based on Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) are used extensively in cereals to study gene function, but nearly all studies have been limited to genes expressed in leaves of barley and wheat. However since many important aspects of plant biology are based on root-expressed genes we wanted to explore the potential of BSMV for silencing genes in root tissues. Furthermore, the newly completed genome sequence of the emerging cereal model species Brachypodium distachyon as well as the increasing amount of EST sequence information available for oat (Avena species) have created a need for tools to study gene function in these species."
"21118486","abstracttext_results","Here we demonstrate the successful BSMV-mediated virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) of three different genes in barley roots, i.e. the barley homologues of the IPS1, PHR1, and PHO2 genes known to participate in Pi uptake and reallocation in Arabidopsis. Attempts to silence two other genes, the Pi transporter gene HvPht1;1 and the endo-Î²-1,4-glucanase gene HvCel1, in barley roots were unsuccessful, probably due to instability of the plant gene inserts in the viral vector. In B. distachyon leaves, significant silencing of the PHYTOENE DESATURASE (BdPDS) gene was obtained as shown by photobleaching as well as quantitative RT-PCR analysis. On the other hand, only very limited silencing of the oat AsPDS gene was observed in both hexaploid (A. sativa) and diploid (A. strigosa) oat. Finally, two modifications of the BSMV vector are presented, allowing ligation-free cloning of DNA fragments into the BSMV-Î³ component."
"21118486","abstracttext_conclusions","Our results show that BSMV can be used as a vector for gene silencing in barley roots and in B. distachyon leaves and possibly roots, opening up possibilities for using VIGS to study cereal root biology and to exploit the wealth of genome information in the new cereal model plant B. distachyon. On the other hand, the silencing induced by BSMV in oat seemed too weak to be of practical use. The new BSMV vectors modified for ligation-free cloning will allow rapid insertion of plant gene fragments for future experiments."
"2102374","articletitle","In vitro processing of transcripts containing novel tRNA-like sequences ('t-elements') encoded by wheat mitochondrial DNA."
"2102374","abstracttext","We have recently described the properties of a wheat mitochondrial extract that is able to process, accurately and efficiently, artificial transcripts containing wheat mitochondrial tRNA sequences, with the production of mature tRNAs (P.J. Hanic-Joyce and M.W. Gray, J. Biol. Chem., in press). Such processing involves 5'-endonucleolytic, 3'-endonucleolytic, and tRNA nucleotidyltransferase activities. Here we show that this system also acts on transcripts containing sequences corresponding to an unusual class of short repeats ('t-elements') in wheat mtDNA. These repeats are theoretically capable of assuming a tRNA-like secondary structure, although stable transcripts corresponding to them are not detectable in vivo. We find that t-element sequences are processed with the same specificity and with comparable efficiency as are authentic tRNA sequences. Because known t-elements are located close to and in the same transcriptional orientation as active genes (18S-5S, 26S, tRNA(Pro)) in wheat mtDNA, our results raise the question of whether t-elements play a role in gene expression in wheat mitochondria."

"10972881","abstracttext","Inserts bearing the coding sequences of NPT II and beta-glucuronidase (GUS) were placed between the nuclear inclusion b (NIb) and coat protein (CP) domains of the wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) polyprotein ORF. The WSMV NIb-CP junction containing the nuclear inclusion a (NIa) protease cleavage site was duplicated, permitting excision of foreign protein domains from the viral polyprotein. Wheat, barley, oat and maize seedlings supported systemic infection of WSMV bearing NPT II. The NPT II insert was stable for at least 18-30 days post-inoculation and had little effect on WSMV CP accumulation. Histochemical assays indicated the presence of functional GUS protein in systemically infected wheat and barley plants inoculated with WSMV bearing GUS. The GUS constructs had greatly reduced virulence on both oat and maize. RT-PCR indicated that the GUS insert was subject to deletion, particularly when expressed as a GUS-NIb protein fusion. Both reporter genes were expressed in wheat roots at levels comparable to those observed in leaves. These results clearly demonstrate the utility of WSMV as a transient gene expression vector for grass species, including two important grain crops, wheat and maize. The results further indicate that both host species and the nature of inserted sequences affect the stability and expression of foreign genes delivered by engineered virus genomes."

"15678358","abstracttext","Aspergillus oryzae requires polarized growth for colonization of solid substrates, and this growth phenotype differs from that seen in liquid medium. Various experimental approaches were used to identify genes that are differentially expressed when A. oryzae is grown on wheat kernels and in a wheat-based liquid medium. Hybridization of A. oryzae RNAs to a macroarray bearing cDNAs isolated from a library representing at least 16% of the total number of A. niger genes identified 14 differentially expressed cDNA clones, showing that heterologous macroarray analysis with an A. niger cDNA library can be used to identify regulated gene transcripts in the related species A. oryzae. Moreover, Northern analysis with a selection of eight probes for A. niger genes encoding proteins involved in morphological development and cell wall biosynthesis identified five more differentially expressed genes. A suppression subtractive hybridization procedure revealed another 12 differentially expressed genes. The results presented show that, of the 29 identified genes which are expressed at higher levels during growth on wheat kernels, six encode proteins that are functionally related to polarized growth, four encode products known to be involved in morphogenesis, three code for proteins related to cell wall composition, and nine of the cDNA clones encode novel proteins. These findings pinpoint genes associated with the changes in cellular morphogenesis seen in A. oryzae grown on wheat kernels as opposed to wheat-based liquid medium."

"15505405","abstracttext","MAD2 (mitotic arrest deficient 2) is a highly conserved protein involving in spindle checkpoint control. MAD2 locates at spindle-unattached kinetochores during prophase and dissolves from spindle-attached kinetochores towards metaphase. In this study, we isolated homologous genes encoding for MAD2 from hexaploid wheat. The three homoeologous genes on the long arms of the group-2 chromosomes shared approximately 99% similarity of the nucleotide sequence in coding regions. The intron-exon structures of the three homoeologues were also conserved, showing high similarities to that of the Arabidopsis MAD2 gene. All three homoeologues were transcribed in roots and spikes but not in leaves. We generated antibodies against the polypeptides with amino acid sequences derived from the cDNA sequences of the wheat MAD2 homologues. Using these antibodies, we found MAD2 in wheat root-tip cells to change in location and amount through the cell cycle, similar to those reported for human MAD2. Intense immunostaining signals were observed at the centromeres of all metaphase chromosomes when root-tips were treated with colchicine, a microtubule-destabilizing drug, but no signals were observed in untreated chromosomes. Thus, the wheat MAD2 protein could be a good marker for the functional kinetochores of metaphase chromosomes in wheat."
"15952073","articletitle","Intragenic diversity and functional conservation of the three homoeologous loci of the KN1-type homeobox gene Wknox1 in common wheat."
"15952073","abstracttext","Common wheat represents a typical allohexaploid species and provides a good experimental system for studying genomic alterations associated with allopolyploidization. We studied three homoeologous loci of wheat Wknox1 gene, which is highly homologous to the knotted1 (kn1)-like homeobox (KNOX) genes functioning at shoot apical meristems (SAM). Wknox1 transcripts were detected in SAM, and its overexpression caused abnormal leaf morphology with occasional ectopic leaves in transgenic tobacco plants. A comparative study of the three Wknox1 genomic sequences revealed accumulation of a large number of mutations including insertions and deletions, particularly in the fourth intron and the 5'-upstream region. Some structural mutations including MITE-insertions were allocated in the evolutionary lineage of the wheat genome, suggesting that they occurred at all stages of wheat evolution. A mutation rate was the highest in the Wknox1b locus, which is consistent with the known highest degree of differentiation in the B genome. Despite the structural differentiation, all three Wknox1 homoeologs showed an identical expression pattern in wheat and their promoter regions induced the conserved expression pattern in transgenic tobacco plants. A potential of the intragenic diversity in homoeologs of essential genes as a tool for studying the genome evolution associated with allopolyploidization was discussed."

"14573821","abstracttext","Experiments were conducted to determine if the 37 kDa protein (37K) of Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV) is a virus movement protein. First, evidence was obtained that indicated that 37K has the ability to move from cell to cell, similar to other virus movement proteins (MPs). Plasmids containing the GFP gene fused to the SBWMV 37K, the coat protein (CP) or the CP readthrough domain (RT) ORFs were delivered by biolistic bombardment to wheat and tobacco leaves. In wheat leaves, cell-to-cell movement of GFP-37K was observed, while GFP, GFP-CP and GFP-RT accumulated primarily in single cells. All fusion proteins accumulated in single cells in tobacco leaves. Thus, cell-to-cell movement is a specific property of 37K that occurs in SBWMV host plants. Subcellular accumulation of 37K was studied using SBWMV-infected and 37K-expressing transgenic wheat. In infected and transgenic wheat leaves, 37K accumulated in the cell wall, similar to other virus MPs, and in aggregates in the cytoplasm. Phylogenetic studies were conducted to compare the furovirus 37K proteins with members of the 30K superfamily of virus MPs. Amino acid sequences of the furovirus 37K proteins were aligned with the MPs from 43 representative viruses. The furovirus 37K proteins were found to reside in a clade that also contained the dianthovirus MPs. Combined, these data suggest that SBWMV 37K is probably a virus MP."

"14714874","abstracttext","Germinlike proteins (GLP) are encoded in plants by a gene family with proposed functions in plant development and defense. Genes of GLP subfamily 4 of barley (HvGLP4, formerly referred to as HvOxOLP) and the wheat orthologue TaGLP4 (formerly referred to as TaGLP2a) were previously found to be expressed in pathogen-attacked epidermal tissue of barley and wheat leaves, and the corresponding proteins are proposed to accumulate in the apoplast. Here, the role of HvGLP4 and TaGLP4 in the defense of barley and wheat against Blumeria graminis (DC.) E. O. Speer, the cereal powdery mildew fungus, was examined in an epidermal transient expression system and in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants overexpressing His-tagged HvGLP4. Leaf extracts of transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing HvGLP4 contained a novel His-tagged protein with superoxide dismutase activity and HvGLP4 epitopes. Transient overexpression of TaGLP4 and HvGLP4 enhanced resistance against B. graminis in wheat and barley, whereas transient silencing by RNA interference reduced basal resistance in both cereals. The effect of GLP4 overexpression or silencing was strongly influenced by the genotype of the plant. The data suggest that members of GLP subfamily 4 are components of quantitative resistance in both barley and wheat, acting together with other, as yet unknown, plant components."
"18320247","articletitle","Genome-wide analysis for identification of salt-responsive genes in common wheat."
"18320247","abstracttext","To identify salt-responsive genes in wheat, global expression analysis of transcripts was carried out using oligo-DNA microarrays. Microarrays have been designed from approximately 32,000 unique wheat genes classified from a large number of expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Two-week-old seedlings of wheat were treated with 150 mM NaCl for 1, 6, and 24 h, and their roots and shoots were separately subjected to analyses. Consequently, 5,996 genes showed changes in expression of more than twofold and were classified into 12 groups according to correlations in expression patterns. These salt-responsive genes were assigned functions using the Gene Ontology (GO). Genes assigned to transcription factor, transcription-regulator activity, and DNA-binding functions were preferentially classified into early response groups. On the other hand, those assigned transferase and transporter activity were classified into late response groups. These data suggest that multiple signal transduction pathways in response to salinity exist in wheat. Transcription factors (TFs) which have been reported as participants in salt-tolerant pathway changed their expression levels in response to salt treatment. Among them, only a few TFs show high sequence homologies to genes in rice. These investigations suggest that salt-responsive genes identified by this study are candidates for salt-stress tolerance uniquely in wheat."

"18467324","articletitle","Transgenic wheat expressing a barley class II chitinase gene has enhanced resistance against Fusarium graminearum."
"18467324","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB; scab), primarily caused by Fusarium graminearum, is a devastating disease of wheat worldwide. FHB causes yield reductions and contamination of grains with trichothecene mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON). The genetic variation in existing wheat germplasm pools for FHB resistance is low and may not provide sufficient resistance to develop cultivars through traditional breeding approaches. Thus, genetic engineering provides an additional approach to enhance FHB resistance. The objectives of this study were to develop transgenic wheat expressing a barley class II chitinase and to test the transgenic lines against F. graminearum infection under greenhouse and field conditions. A barley class II chitinase gene was introduced into the spring wheat cultivar, Bobwhite, by biolistic bombardment. Seven transgenic lines were identified that expressed the chitinase transgene and exhibited enhanced Type II resistance in the greenhouse evaluations. These seven transgenic lines were tested under field conditions for percentage FHB severity, percentage visually scabby kernels (VSK), and DON accumulation. Two lines (C8 and C17) that exhibited high chitinase protein levels also showed reduced FHB severity and VSK compared to Bobwhite. One of the lines (C8) also exhibited reduced DON concentration compared with Bobwhite. These results showed that transgenic wheat expressing a barley class II chitinase exhibited enhanced resistance against F. graminearum in greenhouse and field conditions."

"18944714","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Tan spot of wheat, caused by the fungus Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, is a destructive disease found in wheat-growing regions worldwide that can lead to serious yield losses. Changes in cultural practices have led to an increase in the severity and incidence of tan spot. Following infection, compatible races of the fungus elicit two distinct symptoms in differential wheat lines: tan necrosis and (extensive) chlorosis. Tan necrosis has been clearly demonstrated by several groups to result from the action of a protein toxin, Ptr ToxA. Wheat sensitivity to this toxin is conditioned by a single dominant gene. The chlorosis response may be more complex and appears to involve at least two other toxins, Ptr ToxB and Ptr ToxC, produced by different races of the fungus. Distinct genes apparently condition the reaction of wheat lines to each of these chlorosis-inducing toxins. This review concentrates on significant advances that have occurred during the past decade in the characterization of this disease interaction, ranging from the epidemiology and management of tan spot to molecular host-parasite interactions. Particular emphasis is placed on work describing fungal race differentiation, production of toxins and their importance in pathogenicity, and the genetics and physiology of host response to infection."
"18823308","articletitle","Allergens to wheat and related cereals."
"18823308","abstracttext","Wheat is one of the major crops grown, processed and consumed by humankind and is associated with both intolerances (notably coeliac disease) and allergies. Two types of allergy are particularly well characterized. The first is bakers' asthma, which results from the inhalation of flour and dust during grain processing. Although a number of wheat proteins have been shown to bind IgE from patients with bakers' asthma, there is no doubt a well-characterized group of inhibitors of alpha-amylase (also called chloroform methanol soluble, or CM, proteins) are the major components responsible for this syndrome. The second well-characterized form of allergy to wheat proteins is wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA), with the omega(5)-gliadins (part of the gluten protein fraction) being the major group of proteins which are responsible. Other forms of food allergy have also been reported, with the proteins responsible including gluten proteins, CM proteins and non-specific lipid transfer proteins. Processing of wheat and of related cereals (barley and rye, which may contain related allergens) may lead to decreased allergenicity while genetic engineering technology offers opportunities to eliminate allergens by suppressing gene expression."

"17992503","abstracttext","Bread wheat quality is mainly correlated with high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) of endosperm. The number of HMW-GS alleles with good processing quality is limited in bread wheat cultivars, while there are plenty of HMW-GS alleles in wheat-related grasses to exploit. We report here on the cloning and characterization of HMW-GS alleles from the decaploid Agropyron elongatum. Eleven novel HMW-GS alleles were cloned from the grass. Of them, five are x-type and six y-type glutenin subunit genes. Three alleles Aex4, Aey7, and Aey9 showed high similarity with another three alleles from the diploid Lophopyrum elongatum, which provided direct evidence for the Ee genome origination of A. elongatum. It was noted that C-terminal regions of three alleles of the y-type genes Aey8, Aey9, and Aey10 showed more similarity with x-type genes than with other y-type genes. This demonstrates that there is a kind of intermediate state that appeared in the divergence between x- and y-type genes in the HMW-GS evolution. One x-type subunit, Aex4, with an additional cysteine residue, was speculated to be correlated with the good processing quality of wheat introgression lines. Aey4 was deduced to be a chimeric gene from the recombination between another two genes. How the HMW-GS genes of A. elongatum may contribute to the improvement of wheat processing quality are discussed."

"19937208","abstracttext","microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous, non-coding, short (approximately 21 nt) RNAs directly involved in regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Previous reports have noted that plant miRNAs in the plant kingdom are highly conserved, which provides the foundation for identification of conserved miRNAs in other plant species through homology alignment. Conserved miRNAs in wheat are identified using EST (Expressed Sequence Tags) and GSS analysis. All previously known miRNAs in other plant species were blasted against wheat EST and GSS sequences to select novel miRNAs in wheat by a series of filtering criteria. From a total of 37 conserved miRNAs belonging to 18 miRNA families 10 conserved miRNAs comprising 4 families were reported in wheat. MiR395 is found to be a special family, because three members belonging to the same miR395 family are clustered together, similar to animal miRNAs. MiRNA targets are transcription factors involved in wheat growth and development, metabolism,and stress responses."

However, there is a paucity of information on the diversity of Acinetobacter species associated with the wheat rhizosphere. In the present investigation, Acinetobacter species diversity was assessed in the rhizosphere of wheat from three agricultural fields where different varieties were cultivated. The Acinetobacter species diversity was assessed by DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis) of 16S rRNA gene PCR products amplified from total soil DNA using genus-specific primers. Ac. calcoaceticus, Ac. baumannii, Ac. lwoffii, Ac. baylyi and Acinetobacter sp. were detected in the rhizosphere of wheat. Prevalence of Acinetobacter species in the rhizosphere of wheat was also investigated by a cultivation-dependent approach. Ac. calcoaceticus, Ac. baumannii, Ac. lwoffii and Acinetobacter sp. were isolated on selective media from the same samples. In vitro characterization of Acinetobacter isolates revealed that majority of these bacteria exhibited plant growth-promoting traits such as nitrogen fixation, siderophore production and mineral solubilization. These Acinetobacter strains may play a favorable role in plant growth promotion while residing in the rhizosphere of wheat."

Among the 20 wheat CDPK genes studied, 10 were found to respond to drought, salinity and ABA treatments. Consistent with previous observations, one CDPK gene was shown to respond to multiple abiotic stresses in wheat suggesting that CDPKs could be converging points for multiple signaling pathways. Among the 12 wheat CDPK genes that were responsive to Blumeria graminis tritici (Bgt) infection or the treatment of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), eight also responded to abiotic stresses, suggesting a cross-talk between biotic and abiotic stress signaling pathways. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that some of these genes were closely related to CDPKs from other species, whose functions have been partially studied, suggesting similar functions wheat CDPK genes. Combining the up-to-date knowledge of CDPK functions and our observations, a model was developed to project the possible roles of wheat CDPK genes in the signaling of biotic and abiotic stress responses."

"19544051","abstracttext","A rye-wheat centric chromosome translocation 1RS.1BL has been widely used in wheat breeding programs around the world. Increased yield of translocation lines was probably a consequence of increased root biomass. In an effort to map loci-controlling root characteristics, homoeologous recombinants of 1RS with 1BS were used to generate a consensus genetic map comprised of 20 phenotypic and molecular markers, with an average spacing of 2.5 cM. Physically, all recombination events were located in the distal 40% of the arms. A total of 68 recombinants was used and recombination breakpoints were aligned and ordered over map intervals with all the markers, integrated together in a genetic map. This approach enabled dissection of genetic components of quantitative traits, such as root traits, present on 1S. To validate our hypothesis, phenotyping of 45-day-old wheat roots was performed in five lines including three recombinants representative of the entire short arm along with bread wheat parents 'Pavon 76' and Pavon 1RS.1BL. Individual root characteristics were ranked and the genotypic rank sums were subjected to Quade analysis to compare the overall rooting ability of the genotypes. It appears that the terminal 15% of the rye 1RS arm carries gene(s) for greater rooting ability in wheat."

"21459832","abstracttext","NAC proteins are plant-specific transcription factors and enriched with members involved in plant response to drought stress. In this study, we analyzed the expression profiles of TaNAC69 in bread wheat using Affymetrix Wheat Genome Array datasets and quantitative RT-PCR. TaNAC69 expression was positively associated with wheat responses to both abiotic and biotic stresses and was closely correlated with a number of stress up-regulated genes. The functional analyses of TaNAC69 in transgenic wheat showed that TaNAC69 driven by a barley drought-inducible HvDhn4s promoter led to marked drought-inducible overexpression of TaNAC69 in the leaves and roots of transgenic lines. The HvDhn4s:TaNAC69 transgenic lines produced more shoot biomass under combined mild salt stress and water-limitation conditions, had longer root and more root biomass under polyethylene glycol-induced dehydration. Analysis of transgenic lines with constitutive overexpression of TaNAC69 showed the enhanced expression levels of several stress up-regulated genes. DNA-binding assays revealed that TaNAC69 and its rice homolog (ONAC131) were capable of binding to the promoter elements of three rice genes (chitinase, ZIM, and glyoxalase I) and an Arabidopsis glyoxalase I family gene, which are homologs of TaNAC69 up-regulated stress genes. These data suggest that TaNAC69 is involved in regulating stress up-regulated genes and wheat adaptation to drought stress."

"21445866","abstracttext_background","Emmer wheat is a neglected crop that can be used in the breeding of modern durum wheat for quality. One important aspect of this quality is the starch composition, which is related to the waxy proteins. A collection of emmer wheat was analysed previously for waxy protein composition, and two new Wx-B1 alleles were found by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing analysis. It is necessary to analyse the effect of these alleles in starch properties and compare them to durum wheat ones."

Differences were detected between both species, and the line lacking Wx-B1 protein showed a remarkably low amylose content. In addition, data from blue value, swelling power and Rapid Visco Analyzer also suggested that there were differences in starch properties among the different Wx-B1 alleles."

However, little is known about the genes encoding Hsp90s in common wheat. Here, we report genetic and functional analysis of the genes specifying cytosolic Hsp90s in this species. Three groups of homoeologous genes (TaHsp90.1, TaHsp90.2 and TaHsp90.3), encoding three types of cytosolic Hsp90, were isolated. The loci containing TaHsp90.1, TaHsp90.2 and TaHsp90.3 genes were assigned to groups 2, 7 and 5 chromosomes, respectively. TaHsp90.1 genes exhibited higher transcript levels in the stamen than in the leaf, root and culm. TaHsp90.2 and TaHsp90.3 genes were more ubiquitously transcribed in the vegetative and reproductive organs examined. Decreasing the expression of TaHsp90.1 genes through virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) caused pronounced inhibition of wheat seedling growth, whereas the suppression of TaHsp90.2 or TaHsp90.3 genes via VIGS compromised the hypersensitive resistance response of the wheat variety Suwon 11 to stripe rust fungus. Our work represents the first systematic determination of wheat genes encoding cytosolic Hsp90s, and provides useful evidence for the functional involvement of cytosolic Hsp90s in the control of seedling growth and disease resistance in common wheat."

"22132127","abstracttext","This study evaluates the potential of flow cytometry for chromosome sorting in two wild diploid wheats Aegilops umbellulata and Ae. comosa and their natural allotetraploid hybrids Ae. biuncialis and Ae. geniculata. Flow karyotypes obtained after the analysis of DAPI-stained chromosomes were characterized and content of chromosome peaks was determined. Peaks of chromosome 1U could be discriminated in flow karyotypes of Ae. umbellulata and Ae. biuncialis and the chromosome could be sorted with purities exceeding 95%. The remaining chromosomes formed composite peaks and could be sorted in groups of two to four. Twenty four wheat SSR markers were tested for their position on chromosomes of Ae. umbellulata and Ae. comosa using PCR on DNA amplified from flow-sorted chromosomes and genomic DNA of wheat-Ae. geniculata addition lines, respectively. Six SSR markers were located on particular Aegilops chromosomes using sorted chromosomes, thus confirming the usefulness of this approach for physical mapping. The SSR markers are suitable for marker assisted selection of wheat-Aegilops introgression lines. The results obtained in this work provide new opportunities for dissecting genomes of wild relatives of wheat with the aim to assist in alien gene transfer and discovery of novel genes for wheat improvement."

"23415324","abstracttext","Wheat is the most highly cultivated plant species for its grain production throughout the world. Because small RNA-dependent gene regulation is critical for successful completion of plant life cycle including its productivity, identification of not only miRNAs but also confirming their targets in wheat is important. To identify small RNAs including novel miRNAs as well as miRNA targets in wheat, we constructed small RNA and degradome libraries from wheat seedlings. Small RNA analysis resulted in identification of most conserved miRNAs including novel miRNAs that can be grouped into 32 miRNA families. The sequence analysis also led to the characterization of two abundantly expressed rRNA-derived small RNAs. To identify miRNA targets, degradome library was sequenced and the bioinformatic analysis confirmed 53 genes as targets for miRNAs and Tas3-siRNAs. Degradome analysis also confirmed a conserved fine-tuning mechanism of Tas3-siRNA abundance by siRNA-mediated silencing of TAS3 transcripts in diverse plant species. These findings added additional information to the small RNA knowledge-base in wheat."

"23843964","abstracttext","Avenin-like b proteins are a small family of wheat storage proteins, each containing 18 or 19 cysteine residues.

In the present study, two transgenic lines of the bread wheat overexpressing avenin-like b gene were generated to investigate the effects of Avenin-like b proteins on dough mixing properties. Sodium dodecyl sulfate sedimentation (SDSS) test and Mixograph analysis of these lines demonstrated that overexpression of Avenin-like b proteins in both transgenic wheat lines significantly increased SDSS volume and improved dough elasticity, mixing tolerance and resistance to extension. These changes were associated with the increased proportion of polymeric proteins due to the incorporation of overexpressed Avenin-like b proteins into the glutenin polymers. The results of this study were critical to confirm the hypothesis that Avenin-like b proteins could be integrated into glutenin polymers by inter-chain disulphide bonds, which could help understand the mechanism behind strengthening wheat dough strength."

Isolated strains produced a diverse amount of auxin in BG11 media supplemented with different concentrations of L-tryptophan. The amount of auxin detected with colorimetric methods was higher as compared to GC-MS analysis. Auxin production by cyanobacterial strains in BG 11 medium supplemented with 250âÂµgâml(-1) L-tryptophan ranged from 0.20 to 1.63âÂµgâml(-1) IAA as revealed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis. In a hydroponic growth system, the vegetative growth of wheat was stimulated appreciably by inoculation with cyanobacterial strains. The endogenous auxin content of wheat was significantly correlated with the exogenous auxin production of the cyanobacterial strains. It was observed that cyanobacterial strains produced more endogenous and exogenous auxin in the presence of a plant, showing that plants might be releasing some signals responsible for higher auxin production by cyanobacterial cultures. It was concluded that the auxin producing potential of cyanobacterial strains can be exploited for the promotion of wheat growth."

"24683181","abstracttext","The einkorn wheat mutant mvp-1 (maintained vegetative phase 1) has a non-flowering phenotype caused by deletions including, but not limited to, the genes CYS, PHYC, and VRN1. However, the impact of these deletions on global gene expression is still unknown. Transcriptome analysis showed that these deletions caused the upregulation of several pathogenesis-related (PR) and jasmonate-responsive genes. These results suggest that jasmonates may be involved in flowering and vernalization in wheat. To test this hypothesis, jasmonic acid (JA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) content in mvp and wild-type plants was measured. The content of JA was comparable in all plants, whereas the content of MeJA was higher by more than 6-fold in mvp plants. The accumulation of MeJA was also observed in vernalization-sensitive hexaploid winter wheat during cold exposure. This accumulation declined rapidly once plants were deacclimated under floral-inductive growth conditions. This suggests that MeJA may have a role in floral transition. To confirm this result, we treated vernalization-insensitive spring wheat with MeJA. The treatment delayed flowering with significant downregulation of both TaVRN1 and TaFT1 genes. These data suggest a role for MeJA in modulating vernalization and flowering time in wheat."

"24293360","abstracttext","MYB transcription factors are a large family of proteins involved in the regulation of secondary metabolism and cell shape, the enhancement of disease resistance and the response to different stresses. In this study, the role of TaMYB4 in wheat against biotic and abiotic stresses was investigated. TaMYB4 was cloned from wheat cv. Suwan11 [the leaves were infected with Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici (Pst)]; the TaMYB4 protein is 243 amino acids in length. In addition, TaMYB4 exhibited high similarity with BdMYB4 from Brachypodium distachyon, which was also identified as a member of the R2R3-MYB family of genes. Furthermore, transient expression analysis showed that the deduced TaMYB4 protein was localised in the nucleus of onion epidermal cells. Additionally, a yeast one-hybrid assay revealed that TaMYB4 exhibits transcriptional activity and the C-terminus is necessary for the activation of transcription. The transcript levels of TaMYB4 were observed directly and were found to be significantly upregulated in the early stage and 48Â h after inoculation with the incompatible Pst. The transcripts of TaMYB4 were detected in the wheat roots, culms and leaves. Moreover, the transcription of TaMYB4 was induced by salicylic acid, ethylene, abscisic acid and methyl jasmonate hormones. The same results were obtained with cold and wound treatments. Furthermore, the knockdown of TaMYB4 expression using virus-induced gene silencing enhanced the susceptibility of wheat cultivar Suwon11 to the incompatible race of Pst. These results demonstrate that TaMYB4 plays a role in the wheat response to biotic stress."

The effect of domestication is deduced by comparing isozymic frequencies between wild emmer and durum wheat. It involves changes in frequencies mainly towards the accumulation of ""null"" alleles. The richest origins of genetic variation for durum wheat were Iran, Mexico, Ethiopia, Egypt and Afghanistan. Generally, between-entry variability was larger than the withinentry component. Exceptions were the accessions from Mexico, Greece, Argentina and Cyprus. The relationships between origins were greatly affected by their within-variability, the logic in the grouping is mostly along geographical or political lines. Egypt might be considered a microcenter of diversity for durum wheat within the Mediterranean center, although it is certainly related to Ethiopia (included in the Abisinic center). Mexico has become a new microcenter of diversity, quite likely man-made, and is distant from other centers of durum wheat diversity as far as gene frequency is concerned."

"25475390","abstracttext","Extensive studies have focused on the largest class of disease resistance genes (nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat, NBS-LRR) in various plants. However, no research on the dynamic evolution of these genes in domesticated species and their progenitors has been reported. Recently published genome sequences of bread wheat and its two ancestors provide a good opportunity for comparing NBS-encoding genes between ancestors and their progeny. Over 2000 NBS-encoding genes have been identified in bread wheat, which is the largest number having been reported so far. Compared with other grass species, its two progenitors also contained more NBS-encoding genes, indicating that there was an expansion of these genes in their common ancestor. Interestingly, the inherited relationships of NBS-LRR genes among the bread wheat and its two progenitors were ambiguous and only 3 % single-copy orthologues retained gene order in three-way genome comparisons of the three genomes. Lots of NBS-encoding genes present in the either ancestor could not be found in the bread wheat. These results indicated that NBS-LRR genes in bread wheat might have evolved rapidly through a rapid loss of ancestor genes."

"25036173","abstracttext","Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp tritici (Bgt) is one of the devastating diseases of wheat and causes yield losses in temperate wheat growing regions. A wheat line, N0308 with resistance to powdery mildew was used in this study. A suppression subtractive hybridization cDNA library was constructed from the wheat leaves inoculated by Bgt at the two-leaf stage. The differentially expressed genes in response to Bgt infection in wheat were identified, and a total of 175 positive clones from the library were sequenced, and 90 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were subjected to clustering, BLAST alignment, functional annotation, and classification into different categories. By comparing the EST sequences among the SSH-cDNA libraries, we analyzed gene expression patterns of 7 ESTs associated with the resistance reaction of powdery mildew by using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The expression of 5 genes (sulfatase, pathogenesis-related protein 17, betacarbonic anhydrase 2, thioredoxin h-like protein, and coronatine-insensitive) transcripts was induced, and the transcript levels of these genes were the highest at 72 h after Bgt infection, while those of 2 genes (violaxanthin de-epoxidase and gag-pol-polyprotein) were the highest level at 12 and 18 h post-infection, respectively. These findings suggest that these genes are induced at an early stage of infection and are transcriptionally activated for the host defense response."

"25243379","abstracttext","Wheat Dn genes afford resistance to the economically important pest, Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov, Russian wheat aphid, RWA) and have been the topic of transcriptomic and proteomic studies aimed at unraveling the pathways involved in resistance. The antibiotic resistance conveyed by Dn1 is characterized by a hypersensitive response (HR) followed by systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Although many candidate genes differentially expressed during the Dn1-mediated resistance response have been identified, few have been functionally verified. The aim of this study was to silence three HR-associated candidate genes in Dn1 containing wheat using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS): thylakoid-associated ascorbate peroxidase (tAPX), phi-class glutathione-S-transferase (TaGSTF6) and superoxide dismutase Cu/Zn (SOD). D. noxia fertility was used as a measure of antibiotic resistance. Silencing of SOD Cu/Zn had little effect on D. noxia fertility, while increased aphid reproduction was recorded on tAPX- and TaGSTF6-silenced plants. However, tAPX-silencing only affected early measurements and did not have a prolonged effect on resistance. TaGSTF6-silenced plants expressed lowered H2 O2 production in resistant wheat under infestation conditions, suggesting that TaGSTF6 and H2 O2 play an integral role in Dn1-mediated D. noxia resistance in wheat plants."

"25966171","abstracttext","HTS-1 is a new kind of pistillody wheat. All or parts of its stamen are transformed into pistils or pistil-like structures, and it has more seed sets per floret than normal wheat under normal cultivation conditions. To investigate the expression divergence in this mutant, an annealing control primer system was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the young spikelets. As a result, three DEGs, including HDB2, HGF2, and HCG4, were detected, with variable expression in HTS-1 and the control. After further confirmation using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis, these genes were overexpressed in HTS-1 wheat. NGF2 was identified in the double ridge to floret differentiation stages; HDB2 and HCG4 were identified in the stage of pistil and stamen-differentiating. Therefore, we inferred that the homeotic transformation of stamens into pistil-like structures occurred during the early stage of stamen development. Sequence alignment analysis revealed that HDB2 encodes a putative protein of 189 amino acids, with high homology to the DEAD-box ATP-dependent RNA helicase, and HCG4 was identical to the Chinese spring wheat cDNA clone predicted protein according to GenBank. However, NGF2 was not found to have significant similarity to any reported proteins, suggesting it is a new functional gene in wheat. The results suggest that HDB2, HCG4, and HGF2 are minor genes contributing to pistillody trait formation in HTS-1."

"25639381","abstracttext","A distinguishing feature of Septoria leaf blotch disease in wheat is the long symptomless growth of the fungus amongst host cells followed by a rapid transition to necrotrophic growth resulting in disease lesions. Global reprogramming of host transcription marks this switch to necrotrophic growth. However no information exists on the components that bring about host transcriptional reprogramming. Gene-silencing, confocal-imaging and protein-protein interaction assays where employed to identify a plant homeodomain (PHD) protein, TaR1 in wheat that plays a critical role during the transition from symptomless to necrotrophic growth of Septoria. TaR1-silenced wheat show earlier symptom development upon Septoria infection but reduced fungal sporulation indicating that TaR1 is key for prolonging the symptomless phase and facilitating Septoria asexual reproduction. TaR1 is localized to the nucleus and binds to wheat Histone 3. Trimethylation of Histone 3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) and lysine 36 (H3K36) are found on open chromatin with actively transcribed genes, whereas methylation of H3K27 and H3K9 are associated with repressed loci. TaR1 specifically recognizes dimethylated and trimethylated H3K4 peptides suggesting that it regulates transcriptional activation at open chromatin. We conclude that TaR1 is an important component for the pathogen life cycle in wheat that promotes successful colonization by Septoria."

It was identified using cytology, genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), EST-SSR, EST-STS and morphological analyses. However, these techniques are not suitable for breeding programs that require the rapid screening of large numbers of genotypes because they are highly technical and time-consuming. In this study, three Ns genome-specific SCAR markers were developed via random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. These SCAR markers were further validated using a complete set of wheat-P. huashanica disomic addition lines, which segregated the 5Ns disomic addition line individuals. Our results indicated that the SCAR markers associated with the 5Ns chromosome of P. huashanica and they provide a low cost, high efficiency, alternative tool for screening 5Ns chromosomes in a wheat background. These newly developed SCAR markers that species-specificity of the markers was proved by analysis of a wide range of cereal species, and specific for 5Ns chromosome, which should be useful in marker-assisted selection for wheat breeders who want to screen genotypes that may contain 5Ns chromatin."

"26687862","abstracttext","Hybrid chlorosis, one of the reproductive barriers between tetraploid wheat and its D-genome progenitor, Aegilops tauschii, inhibits normal growth of synthetic wheat hexaploids. Hybrid chlorosis appears to be due to an epistatic interaction of two loci from the AB and D wheat genomes. Our previous study assigned the causal D-genome gene for hybrid chlorosis, Hch1, to the short arm of chromosome 7D. Here, we constructed a fine map of 7DS near Hch1 using 280 F2 individuals from a cross of two wheat synthetic lines, one showing normal growth and the other showing hybrid chlorosis. The hybrid chlorosis phenotype was controlled by a single dominant allele of the Hch1 locus in the synthetic hexaploids. Hch1 was closely linked to four new markers within 0.2 cM, and may be localized near or within the two Ae. tauschii scaffolds containing the linked markers on 7DS. Comparative analysis of the Hch1 chromosomal region for Ae. tauschii, barley and Brachypodium showed that a local inversion occurred in the region proximal to Hch1 during the divergence between barley and Ae. tauschii, and that the Hch1 region on wheat 7DS is syntenic to Brachypodium chromosome 1. These observations provide useful information for further studies toward map-based cloning of Hch1."

"26466852","abstracttext","In wheat, a lack of genetic diversity between breeding lines has been recognized as a significant block to future yield increases. Species belonging to bread wheat's secondary and tertiary gene pools harbour a much greater level of genetic variability, and are an important source of genes to broaden its genetic base. Introgression of novel genes from progenitors and related species has been widely employed to improve the agronomic characteristics of hexaploid wheat, but this approach has been hampered by a lack of markers that can be used to track introduced chromosome segments. Here, we describe the identification of a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms that can be used to genotype hexaploid wheat and to identify and track introgressions from a variety of sources. We have validated these markers using an ultra-high-density Axiom(Â®) genotyping array to characterize a range of diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid wheat accessions and wheat relatives. To facilitate the use of these, both the markers and the associated sequence and genotype information have been made available through an interactive web site."

"27090607","abstracttext","To effectively use elite genes on the long arm of rye chromosome 6 (the 6RL arm) in wheat breeding programs, precise and fast identification of 6RL chromatin in wheat backgrounds is necessary. PCR-based 6RL-specific markers can facilitate the detection of elite genes on 6RL in wheat breeding. However, only a limited number of 6RL-specific markers have been developed. In the present study, 300 new PCR-based 6RL-specific markers were identified using specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) technology, and were further physically mapped to four regions on the 6RL arm using 6R and 6RL deletion lines. Interestingly, 127 of the 300 markers were physically localized to a region from the site between 2.3 and 2.5 to the telomere, the same region where the powdery mildew resistance gene was mapped. In addition, 95 of the 300 markers exhibit polymorphisms, which can be used to investigate the diversity of rye 6RL arms. The markers developed in this study can be used to identify given segments of 6RL in wheat backgrounds and accelerate the utilization of elite genes on 6RL in wheat breeding."

"27359266","abstracttext","Wheat stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, can cause severe yield losses on susceptible wheat varieties and cultivars. Although stem rust can be controlled by the use of genetic resistance, population dynamics of P. graminis f. sp. tritici can frequently lead to defeat of wheat stem rust resistance genes. P. graminis f. sp. tritici race TKTTF caused a severe epidemic in Ethiopia on Ug99-resistant 'Digalu' in 2013 and 2014. The gene Sr11 confers resistance to race TKTTF and is present in 'Gabo 56'. We identified seven single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers linked to Sr11 from a cross between Gabo 56 and 'Chinese Spring' exploiting a 90K Infinium iSelect Custom beadchip. Five SNP markers were validated on a 'Berkut'/'Scalavatis' population that segregated for Sr11, using KBioscience competitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (KASP) assays. Two of the SNP markers, KASP_6BL_IWB10724 and KASP_6BL_IWB72471, were predictive of Sr11 among wheat genetic stocks, cultivars, and breeding lines from North America, Ethiopia, and Pakistan. These markers can be utilized to select for Sr11 in wheat breeding and to detect the presence of Sr11 in uncharacterized germplasm."

"27458472","abstracttext","Current trends in population growth and consumption patterns continue to increase the demand for wheat, a key cereal for global food security. Further, multiple abiotic challenges due to climate change and evolving pathogen and pests pose a major concern for increasing wheat production globally. Triticeae species comprising of primary, secondary, and tertiary gene pools represent a rich source of genetic diversity in wheat. The conventional breeding strategies of direct hybridization, backcrossing and selection have successfully introgressed a number of desirable traits associated with grain yield, adaptation to abiotic stresses, disease resistance, and bio-fortification of wheat varieties. However, it is time consuming to incorporate genes conferring tolerance/resistance to multiple stresses in a single wheat variety by conventional approaches due to limitations in screening methods and the lower probabilities of combining desirable alleles. Efforts on developing innovative breeding strategies, novel tools and utilizing genetic diversity for new genes/alleles are essential to improve productivity, reduce vulnerability to diseases and pests and enhance nutritional quality. New technologies of high-throughput phenotyping, genome sequencing and genomic selection are promising approaches to maximize progeny screening and selection to accelerate the genetic gains in breeding more productive varieties. Use of cisgenic techniques to transfer beneficial alleles and their combinations within related species also offer great promise especially to achieve durable rust resistance."
"27342224","articletitle","Silencing of ABCC13 transporter in wheat reveals its involvement in grain development, phytic acid accumulation and lateral root formation."
"27342224","abstracttext","Low phytic acid is a trait desired in cereal crops and can be achieved by manipulating the genes involved either in its biosynthesis or its transport in the vacuoles. Previously, we have demonstrated that the wheat TaABCC13 protein is a functional transporter, primarily involved in heavy metal tolerance, and a probable candidate gene to achieve low phytate wheat. In the current study, RNA silencing was used to knockdown the expression of TaABCC13 in order to evaluate its functional importance in wheat. Transgenic plants with significantly reduced TaABCC13 transcripts in either seeds or roots were selected for further studies. Homozygous RNAi lines K1B4 and K4G7 exhibited 34-22% reduction of the phytic acid content in the mature grains (T4 seeds). These transgenic lines were defective for spike development, as characterized by reduced grain filling and numbers of spikelets. The seeds of transgenic wheat had delayed germination, but the viability of the seedlings was unaffected. Interestingly, early emergence of lateral roots was observed in TaABCC13-silenced lines as compared to non-transgenic lines. In addition, these lines also had defects in metal uptake and development of lateral roots in the presence of cadmium stress. Our results suggest roles of TaABCC13 in lateral root initiation and enhanced sensitivity towards heavy metals. Taken together, these data demonstrate that wheat ABCC13 is functionally important for grain development and plays an important role during detoxification of heavy metals."

"27858182","abstracttext","Azorhizobium caulinodans ORS571, a novel rhizobium, forms endosymbionts with its nature host Sesbania rostrata, a semi-aquatic leguminous tree. Recent studies showed that A. caulinodans ORS571, as endophytic rhizobium, disseminated and colonized inside of cereal plants. However, how this rhizobium infects monocot plants and the regulatory mechanism remains unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, endogenous RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional levels. In this study, we employed laser scanning confocal microscope to monitor the pathway that rhizobium invade wheat; we also investigated the potential role of miRNAs during A. caulinodans ORS571 infecting wheat. Our results showed that gfp-labeled A. caulinodans ORS571 infected wheat root hairs and emerged lateral roots, then disseminated and colonized within roots and migrated to other plant tissues, such as stems and leaves. Endophytic rhizobium induced the aberrant expression of miRNAs in wheat with a tissue- and time-dependent manner with a peak at 12-24Â h after rhizobium infection. Some miRNAs, such as miR167 and miR393 responded more in roots than that in shoots. In contrast, miR171 responded higher in shoots than that in roots. These results suggested that miRNAs could be responsive to A. caulinodans ORS571 infection and played important role in plant growth, nutrient metabolisms, and wheat-rhizobium interactions."

"27898755","abstracttext","head blight (FHB) is a disease caused predominantly by the fungal pathogen that affects wheat and other small-grain cereals and can lead to severe yield loss and reduction in grain quality. Trichothecene mycotoxins, such as deoxynivalenol (DON), accumulate during infection and increase pathogen virulence and decrease grain quality. The locus on wheat chromosome 3BS confers Type II resistance to FHB and resistance to the spread of infection on the spike and has been associated with resistance to DON accumulation. To gain a better genetic understanding of the functional role of and resistance or susceptibility to FHB, we examined DON and ergosterol accumulation, FHB resistance, and the whole-genome transcriptomic response using RNA-seq in a near-isogenic line (NIL) pair carrying the resistant and susceptible alleles for during infection and DON treatment. Our results provide a gene expression atlas for the resistant and susceptible wheat- interaction. The DON concentration and transcriptomic results show that the rachis is a key location for conferring Type II resistance. In addition, the wheat transcriptome analysis revealed a set of -responsive genes that may play a role in resistance and a set of DON-responsive genes that may play a role in trichothecene resistance. Transcriptomic results from the pathogen show that the genome responds differently to the host level of resistance. The results of this study extend our understanding of host and pathogen responses in the wheat- interaction."

After solid-state fermentation of wheat bran by WRF for 12 d, scanning electron microscopy found that the lignocellulose structure showed degradation and fragmentation. 2. A total of 300 1-d-old broilers were evenly divided by gender and randomly allocated into the following treatments: (1) maize-soybean meal (control group), (2) 10% of wheat bran replacing maize (10% WB group) or (3) 10% of fermented wheat bran replacing maize (10% FWB group). 3. The results indicated that the antioxidant gene expression, such as haem oxygenase-1 and glutathione-S-transferase of chicken peripheral blood mononuclear cells, of the 10% FWB group was significantly higher than that of the control group at d 35. For genes of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxygenase 1 and reactive oxygen species modulator protein 1, the expression of the 10% FWB group was lower than that of the control group at d 21 and 35. 4. In conclusion, wheat bran fermented by WRF could increase lignocellulolytic enzyme activities and the levels of active components that further regulate the expression of antioxidant molecular targets in poultry."

"29315018","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a destructive fungal disease in wheat worldwide. Efforts have been carried out to combat this disease, and the pore-forming toxin-like (PFT) gene at the quantitative trait locus (QTL) Fhb1 was isolated and found to confer resistance to FHB in Sumai 3. In this study, we characterized PFT in 348 wheat accessions. Four haplotypes of PFT were identified. The wild haplotype of PFT had higher resistance than other haplotypes and explained 13.8% of phenotypic variation in FHB resistance by association analysis. PFT was highly expressed during early flowering and increased after Fusarium graminearum treatment in Sumai 3. Analysis of the 5' flanking sequence of PFT predicted that the cis elements of the PFT promoter were related to hormones and biological defense responses. However, PFT existed not only in the FHB-resistant accessions but also in some susceptible accessions. These results suggested that FHB resistance in a diverse range of wheat genotypes is partially conditioned by PFT. The profiling of FHB resistance and the PFT locus in this large collection of wheat germplasm may prove helpful for incorporating FHB resistance into wheat breeding programs, although more work is needed to reveal the exact role of the QTL Fhb1 in conferring resistance to fungal spread."

"29481583","abstracttext","In common wheat, the development of genotyping platforms has been hampered by the large size of the genome, its highly repetitive elements and its allohexaploid nature. However, recent advances in sequencing technology provide opportunities to resolve these difficulties. Using next-generation sequencing and gene-targeting sequence capture, 12,551 nucleotide polymorphisms were detected in the common wheat varieties 'Hatsumochi' and 'Kitahonami' and were assigned to chromosome arms using International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium survey sequences. Because the number of markers for D genome chromosomes in commercially available wheat single nucleotide polymorphism arrays is insufficient, we developed markers using a genome-specific amplicon sequencing strategy. Approximately 80% of the designed primers successfully amplified D genome-specific products, suggesting that by concentrating on a specific subgenome, we were able to design successful markers as efficiently as could be done in a diploid species. The newly developed markers were uniformly distributed across the D genome and greatly extended the total coverage. Polymorphisms were surveyed in six varieties, and 31,542 polymorphic sites and 5,986 potential marker sites were detected in the D genome. The marker development and genotyping strategies are cost effective, robust and flexible and may enhance multi-sample studies in the post-genomic era in wheat."

Coding sequences of wheat genes obtained from ENSEMBL were aligned to known AMT and NRT sequences of Arabidopsis, barley, maize, rice, and wheat to retrieve homologous genes. Bayesian phylogenetic relationships among these genes showed distinct classification of sequences with significant homology to NRT1, NRT2, and NRT3 (NAR2). Inter-species gene duplication analysis showed that eight AMT and 77 NRT genes were orthologous to the AMT and NRT genes of aforementioned plant species. Expression patterns of these genes were studied via whole transcriptome sequencing of 21-day old seedlings of five spring wheat lines. Eight AMT and 52 NRT genes were differentially expressed between root and shoot; and 131 genes did not express neither in root nor in shoot of 21-day old seedlings. Homeologous genes in the A, B, and D genomes, characterized by high sequence homology, revealed that their counterparts exhibited different expression patterns. This complement and evolutionary relationship of wheat AMT and NRT genes is expected to help in development of wheat germplasm with increased efficiency in nitrogen uptake and usage."

"29775096","abstracttext","Arsenic (As) is a phytotoxic element causing health hazards. This work investigates whether and how silicon (Si) alleviates As toxicity in wheat. The addition of Si under As-stress significantly improved morphophysiological characteristics, total protein, and membrane stability compared to As-stressed plants, suggesting that Si does have critical roles in As detoxification in wheat. Analysis of arsenate reductase activity and phytosiderophore (PS) release reveals their no involvement in the Si-mediated alleviation of As in wheat. Furthermore, Si supplementation in As-stressed plants showed a significant increase of As in roots but not in shoots compared with the plants grown under As stress. Further, gene expression analysis of two chelating molecules, TaPCS1 (phytochelatin synthase) and TaMT1 (metallothionein synthase) showed significant induction due to Si application under As stress compared with As-stressed plants. It is consistent with the physiological observations and suggests that alleviation of As toxicity in rice might be associated with As sequestration in roots leading to reduced As translocation in shoots. Furthermore, increased catalase, peroxidase, and glutathione reductase activities in roots imply the active involvement of reactive oxygen species scavenging for protecting wheat plants from As-induced oxidative injury. The study provides mechanistic evidence on the beneficial effect of Si on As toxicity in wheat plants."

Wheat landraces represent a rich source of powdery mildew resistance. Here, we report the map-based cloning of powdery mildew resistance gene Pm24 from Chinese wheat landrace Hulutou. It encodes a tandem kinase protein (TKP) with putative kinase-pseudokinase domains, designated WHEAT TANDEM KINASE 3 (WTK3). The resistance function of Pm24 was validated by transgenic assay, independent mutants, and allelic association analyses. Haplotype analysis revealed that a rare 6-bp natural deletion of lysine-glycine codons, endemic to wheat landraces of Shaanxi Province, China, in the kinase I domain (Kin I) of WTK3 is critical for the resistance function. Transgenic assay of WTK3 chimeric variants revealed that only the specific two amino acid deletion, rather than any of the single or more amino acid deletions, in the Kin I of WTK3 is responsible for gaining the resistance function of WTK3 against the Bgt fungus."

In the last few years, the incidence and severity of FCR progressively increased in China, and the disease has currently become a new threat to local wheat crops. Here, we report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on a set of 358 Chinese germplasms with the wheat 55Â K SNP array. A total of 104 SNPs on chromosomes 1BS, 1DS, 2AL, 5AL, 5DS, 5DL, 6BS and 7BL were significantly associated with seedling resistance to FCR in the association panel. Of these SNPs, a novel 13.78Â Mb region targeted by five SNPs on chromosome arm 5DL was continually detected in all three trials. The effects of this region on FCR resistance was confirmed in biparental population. qRT-PCR showed that within this 5DL region, several genes encoding TIR-NBS-LRR proteins and proteins related to mycotoxins deoxynivalenol (DON) detoxification increased rapidly in the disease-resistant variety 04 Zhong 36 than the susceptible variety Xinmai 26 after inoculation.

LsCYP4DE1, whose expression was 9.5-fold higher in the wheat-adapted SBPH (wSBPH) than in the rice-adapted SBPH (rSBPH), appeared to have an important role in the colonization of wheat plants. Knocking down the expression of LsCYP4DE1 led to increased mortality, as well as decreased performance of SBPHs reared on wheat. However, no significant difference was found in dsLsCYP4DE1-treated SBPHs on rice plants. In addition, LsCYP4DE1 was potentially associated with pesticide tolerance, and suppression of its expression led to increased sensitivity to the pesticide ethiprole. Our results revealed potential roles of LsCYP4DE1 in wheat adaptation and ethiprole tolerance, and provide useful information for pest management."
"30780437","articletitle","Applying Real-Time Quantitative PCR to Fusarium Crown Rot of Wheat."
"30780437","abstracttext","Fusarium crown rot (FCR) of wheat is a persistent problem that causes significant losses worldwide. In Montana, FCR is caused primarily by Fusarium culmorum and F. pseudograminearum. Recently, a real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR) assay was developed for FCR using primers and probes specific for a segment of the trichodiene synthase (tri5) gene. The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of QPCR for accessing FCR severity on wheat in field experiments. In 2004 and 2005, plots of spring and durum wheat were inoculated with varying levels of F. pseudograminearum oat inoculum and grown under rain-fed conditions. Two weeks prior to harvest, plants were collected from the plots and assessed for FCR severity and analyzed by QPCR for Fusarium DNA quantities. Disease severity scores (DSS) and Fusarium DNA quantities were positively correlated with each other for all three cultivars in 2004 but for only the durum cultivar in 2005 (P < 0.05). In 2004, grain yields for both spring wheat cultivars were negatively correlated with Fusarium DNA quantities (P > 0.05). When DSS and Fusarium DNA quantities negatively correlated with yield, both measurements were comparable in predicting yield reduction (R = -0.64 and -0.77, respectively). Results indicate that this QPCR assay is effective in measuring FCR severity in wheat."

"30852238","abstracttext","Alkali (high-pH) stress is an important factor limiting agricultural production and has complex effects on plant metabolism. Transcriptomics is widely used in the discovery of stress-response genes, but it provides only a rough estimation for gene expression. Proteomics may be more helpful than transcriptomics for the discovery and identification of stress-response genes. In this study, wheat plants were treated with sodic alkaline stress (50â¯mM, NaHCO 3 : Na 2 CO 3 â¯=â¯1:1; pH 9.7), and then proteomic analysis was carried out on control and stressed plants. We detected 3,104 proteins, including 69 alkaline stress-response proteins. Five superoxide dismutases, three malate dehydrogenases, three dehydrin proteins, and one V-ATPase protein were upregulated in sodic alkaline-stressed wheat roots. We propose that these salinity response proteins may be important for ion homeostasis and osmotic regulation of sodic alkaline-stressed wheat. Additionally, two malic enzymes and many enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) were downregulated in the roots. The upregulation of malate dehydrogenase and the downregulation of TCA enzymes and malic enzymes may enhance the accumulation of malate in sodic alkaline-stressed wheat roots. Previous studies have demonstrated that the accumulation of malate in roots is a crucial adaptive mechanism of wheat to sodic alkaline stress. Herein, our proteomics results provided molecular insights into this adaptive mechanism."

Single uredinial isolates (1,120 in total) were derived from the wheat leaf rust collections and tested for virulence phenotype on 16 lines of Thatcher wheat that are near-isogenic for leaf rust resistance genes. In the United States in 2000, 54 virulence phenotypes of P. triticina were found. Virulence phenotypes MBDS and MCDS, which are virulent to resistance gene Lr17, were the first and third most common phenotypes in the United States and were found in the Great Plains and the Ohio Valley regions. MCRK, which is virulent to Lr26, was the second most common phenotype and was found primarily in the Southeast, Ohio Valley, and Northeast regions. In the northern area of the Great Plains, phenotypes with virulence to Lr16 increased in frequency from 1998 and 1999. The Southeast and Great Plains regions had different predominant virulence phenotypes, which indicates that populations of P. triticina in those areas are not closely connected. The northern and southern areas of the Great Plains region had the same predominant virulence phenotypes, indicating movement of virulence phenotypes of P. triticina within this region."

"30908973","abstracttext","The purpose of experiments was to describe the alterations of content of steroid regulators (brassinosteroids, progesterone) during cold hardening of winter wheat. Further we studied physiological and biochemical changes induced by these steroids in cold hardened winter wheat together with estimation of plant frost tolerance. The endogenous brassinosteroid content was elevated in winter wheat during cold hardening while level of progesterone was lowered. A higher content of brassinosteroids (but not progesterone) was connected to better frost tolerance of winter wheat cultivars. Plant supplementation with brassinosteroid (24-epibrassinolide) and progesterone before cold hardening reduced frost damage. Tests with the inhibitors of the biosynthesis of brassinosteroids and progesterone suggested that these steroids are one of players in regulating the antioxidant system in winter wheat during cold hardening. Their role in regulating the expression of Rubisco or the Rubisco activase gene was less clear. Steroid regulators did not affect the content of the stress hormone ABA. Model studies of the membranes, made on a Langmuir bath, showed an increase in the value of the parameter describing differences in membrane compressibility (resulting from stronger interactions among the molecules in the monolayers). This suggests that 24-epibrassinolide and progesterone enter into the lipid layer and - in a similar way to sterols - stabilise the interaction among lipids. It may be significant step for better frost tolerance. The use of steroid regulators (especially brassinosteroids) as agrochemicals improving frost tolerance of winter cereals will be discussed."

"30524466","abstracttext","Recent stem rust epidemics in eastern Africa and elsewhere demonstrated that wheat stem rust is a re-emerging disease posing a threat to wheat production worldwide. The cultivated wheat gene pool has a narrow genetic base for resistance to virulent races, such as races in the Ug99 race group. Wild relatives of wheat are a tractable source of stem rust resistance genes. Aegilops species in the tertiary genepool have not been exploited to any great extent as a source of stem rust resistance. We evaluated 1,422 accessions of Aegilops spp. for resistance to three highly virulent races (TTKSK, TRTTF, and TTTTF) of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici . Species studied include Ae. biuncialis, Ae . caudata, Ae. comosa, Ae. cylindrica, Ae. geniculata, Ae. neglecta, Ae. peregrina, Ae. triuncialis , and Ae. umbellulata that do not share common genomes with cultivated wheat. High frequencies of resistance were observed as 977 (68.8%), 927 (65.2%), and 850 (59.8%) accessions exhibited low infection types to races TTKSK, TTTTF, and TRTTF, respectively. Contingency table analyses showed strong association for resistance to different races in several Aegilop s spp., indicating that for a given species, the resistance genes effective against multiple races. Inheritance studies in selected accessions showed that resistance to race TTKSK is simply inherited."

"30486239","abstracttext","Common wheat originated from interspecific hybridization between cultivated tetraploid wheat and its wild diploid relative Aegilops tauschii followed by amphidiploidization. This evolutionary process can be reproduced artificially, resulting in synthetic hexaploid wheat lines. Here we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based bulked segregant analysis (BSA) using a bi-parental mapping population of two synthetic hexaploid wheat lines that shared identical A and B genomes but included with D-genomes of distinct origins. This analysis permitted identification of D-genome-specific polymorphisms around the Net2 gene, a causative locus to hybrid necrosis. The resulting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were classified into homoeologous polymorphisms and D-genome allelic variations, based on the RNA-seq results of a parental tetraploid and two Ae. tauschii accessions. The difference in allele frequency at the D-genome-specific SNP sites between the contrasting bulks (ÎSNP-index) was higher on the target chromosome than on the other chromosomes. Several SNPs with the highest ÎSNP-indices were converted into molecular markers and assigned to the Net2 chromosomal region. These results indicated that RNA-seq-based BSA can be applied efficiently to a synthetic hexaploid wheat population to permit molecular marker development in a specific chromosomal region of the D genome."

"31813131","abstracttext","Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, the causal agent of wheat powdery mildew disease, can occur at all stages of the crop and constantly threatens wheat production. To identify candidate resistance genes for powdery mildew, we performed GWAS (genome-wide association studies) on a total set of 329 wheat varieties obtained from different origins. These wheat materials were genotyped using wheat 90K SNP array and evaluated for their resistance in either field or glasshouse condition from 2016 to 2018. Using a mixed linear model, 33 SNP markers of which 14 QTL (quantitative trait loci) were later defined were observed to associate with powdery mildew resistance. Among these, QTL on chromosome 3A, 3B, 6D and 7D were concluded as potentially new QTL. Exploration of candidate genes for new QTL suggested roles of these genes involved in encoding disease resistance and defence-related proteins, and regulating early immune response to the pathogen. Overall, the results reveal that GWAS can be an effective means of identifying marker-trait associations, though further functional validation and fine-mapping of gene candidates are required before creating opportunities for developing new resistant genotypes."

"31108903","abstracttext","Leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks is one of the most problematic diseases of wheat throughout the world. The gene Lr42 confers effective resistance against leaf rust at both seedling and adult plant stages. Previous studies had reported Lr42 to be both recessive and dominant in hexaploid wheat; however, in diploid Aegilops tauschii (TA2450), we found Lr42 to be dominant by studying segregation in two independent F 2 and their F 2:3 populations. We further fine-mapped Lr42 in hexaploid wheat using a KS93U50/Morocco F 5 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population to a 3.7 cM genetic interval flanked by markers TC387992 and WMC432 . The 3.7 cM Lr42 region physically corresponds to a 3.16 Mb genomic region on chromosome 1DS based on the Chinese Spring reference genome (RefSeq v.1.1) and a 3.5 Mb genomic interval on chromosome 1 in the Ae. tauschii reference genome. This region includes nine nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR) genes in wheat and seven in Ae. tauschii , respectively, and these are the likely candidates for Lr42 . Furthermore, we developed two kompetitive allele-specific polymorphism (KASP) markers ( SNP113325 and TC387992 ) flanking Lr42 to facilitate marker-assisted selection for rust resistance in wheat breeding programs."

Wheat and other major cereals are a good source of nutrients, such as carbohydrates and proteins, but cannot supply a sufficient amount of essential micronutrients, including provitamin A. As vitamin A deficiency (VAD) leads to several serious diseases throughout the world, the biofortification of a major staple crop, such as wheat, represents an effective way to preserve human health in developing countries. In the present work, a key enzyme involved in the branch of carotenoids pathway producing Î²-carotene, lycopene epsilon cyclase, has been targeted by a Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes (TILLING) approach in a ""block strategy"" perspective. The null mutant genotype showed a strong reduction in the expression of the lcyE gene and also interesting pleiotropic effects on an enzyme (Î²-ring hydroxylase) acting downstream in the pathway. Biochemical profiling of carotenoids in the wheat mutant lines showed an increase of roughly 75% in Î²-carotene in the grains of the complete mutant line compared with the control. In conclusion, we describe here the production and characterization of a new wheat line biofortified with provitamin A obtained through a nontransgenic approach, which also sheds new light on the molecular mechanism governing carotenoid biosynthesis in durum wheat."

Expression of 11 identified polycistronic miRNAs could be validated using previously assembled transcriptomes, RNA-seq/s-RNA seq data of cultivated and wild wheats and RT-PCR. Polycistronic miRNAs orthologs were also localized on rice and Brachypodium genomes. As a case study, we also analyzed molecular evolution of miR395 family polycistrons in wheat. Both tandem and segmental duplications contributed to expansion of miR395 family polycistrons. Our findings provide a comprehensive view on wheat polycitronic miRNAs that will enable their in-depth functional analysis in the future."

"31929605","abstracttext","In wheat, adult plant resistance (APR) to leaf rust (Puccinia triticina), is effective in restricting pathogen growth and provides durable resistance against a wide range of virulent forms of P. triticina. Despite the importance, there is limited knowledge on the molecular basis of this type of resistance. We isolated and characterized the wall-associated kinase encoding gene in wheat, and assigned it as TaWAK6. Localization of TaWAK6 homeologs in A and B wheat subgenomes was consistent with the presence of the gene's orthologs in T. urartu (AA) and T. dicoccoides (AABB) and with the absence of its orthologs in Aegilops tauschii (DD). Overexpression of TaWAK6 did not change the wheat phenotype, nor did it affect seedling resistance. However, the adult plants overexpressing TaWAK6 showed that important parameters of APR were significantly elevated. Infection types scored on the first (flag), second and third leaves indicated elevated resistance, which significantly correlated with expression of TaWAK6. Analysis of plant-pathogen interactions showed a lower number of uredinia and higher rates of necrosis at the infection sites and this was associated with smaller size of uredinia and a longer latent period. The results indicated a role of TaWAK6 in quantitative partial resistance similar to APR in wheat. It is proposed that TaWAK6, which is a non-arginine-aspartate (non-RD) kinase, represents a novel class of quantitative immune receptors in monocots."

"31875036","abstracttext","Low phosphorus availability is a major abiotic factor constraining wheat growth. The molecular mechanisms of the wheat whole genome under low-phosphorus stress are still unclear. To obtain information on gene expression in wheat seedlings under low-phosphorus stress, transcriptome sequencing was performed on roots and leaves. The results showed that 2,318 (1,646 upregulated and 672 downregulated) transcripts were differentially expressed in the leaves, and 2,018 (1,310 upregulated and 708 downregulated) were differentially expressed in the roots. Further analysis showed that these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly enriched in carbon fixation in photosynthetic organs and in carbon metabolism, photosynthesis, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism and plant-pathogen interaction in both leaves and roots. These pathways were mainly associated with environmental adaptation, energy metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism, suggesting that the metabolic processes were strengthened in wheat seedlings under low-phosphorus stress and that more energy and substances were produced to resist or adapt to this unfavourable environment. This research might provide potential directions and valuable resources to further study wheat under low-phosphorus stress."

BSMV-based delivery of single gRNAs for targeted mutagenesis was first validated in Nicotiana benthamiana. To extend this work, we transformed wheat and maize with the Cas9 nuclease gene and selected the wheat TaGASR7 and maize ZmTMS5 genes as targets to assess the feasibility and efficiency of BSMV-mediated mutagenesis. Positive targeted mutagenesis of the TaGASR7 and ZmTMS5 genes was achieved for wheat and maize with efficiencies of up to 78% and 48%. Our results provide a useful tool for fast and efficient delivery of gRNAs into economically important crops."

"31312935","abstracttext","Fusarium pseudograminearum-induced crown rot causes significant reduction to wheat production worldwide. To date, efforts to develop effective resistance to this disease have been hampered by the quantitative nature of resistance trait and a lack of understanding of the molecular pathogenesis. Non-ribosomal peptides have important roles in development, pathogenicity, and toxins in many plant pathogens, while less is known in F. pseudograminearum. In this work, we studied the expression and function of a nonribosomal peptide gene FpNPS9 in F. pseudograminearum. We determined the expression of FpNPS9 which was significantly up regulated during the infection of wheat. A deletion mutant Îfpnps9 produced in this study displayed a normal growth and conidiation phenotype, however, hyphae polar growth was obviously affected. Deoxynivalenol production in this mutant was significantly reduced and the infection of wheat coleoptiles and wheat spikelet was attenuated. The Îfpnps9 showed serious defects on the extension of infectious hyphae in plant and inhibition of roots elongation compared with the wild type. The complementation assay using a FpNPS9-GFP fusion construct fully restored the defects of the mutant. GFP signal was detected in the germinating conidia and infectious hyphae in coleoptiles of the infected plants. Interestingly, the signal was not observed when it was grown on culture medium, suggesting that the expression of FpNPS9 was regulated by an unknown host factor. This observation was supported by the result of qRT-PCR. In summary, we provided new knowledge on FpNPS9 expression in F. pseudograminearum and its function in F. pseudograminearum pathogenicity in wheat."

"31695711","abstracttext","Soil salinity and sodicity are major constraints to global cereal production, but breeding for tolerance has been slow. Narrow gene pools, over-emphasis on the sodium (Na + ) exclusion mechanism, little attention to osmotic stress/tissue tolerance mechanism(s) in which accumulation of inorganic ions such as Na + is implicated, and lack of a suitable screening method have impaired progress. The aims of this study were to discover novel genes for Na + accumulation using genome-wide association studies, compare growth responses to salinity and sodicity in low-Na + bread Westonia with Nax1 and Nax2 genes and high-Na + bread wheat Baart-46, and evaluate growth responses to salinity and sodicity in bread wheats with varying leaf Na + concentrations. The novel high-Na + bread wheat germplasm, MW#293, had higher grain yield under salinity and sodicity, in absolute and relative terms, than the other bread wheat entries tested. Genes associated with high Na + accumulation in bread wheat were identified, which may be involved in tissue tolerance/osmotic adjustment. As most modern bread wheats are efficient at excluding Na + , further reduction in plant Na + is unlikely to provide agronomic benefit. The salinity and sodicity tolerant germplasm MW#293 provides an opportunity for the development of future salinity/sodicity tolerant bread wheat."

"32896217","abstracttext","Trichothecene mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON), are virulence factors of Fusarium graminearum, which causes Fusarium head blight (FHB), one of the most important diseases of small grain cereals. We previously identified a non-specific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP) gene, AtLTP4.4, which was overexpressed in an activation tagged Arabidopsis line resistant to trichothecin (Tcin), a type B trichothecene in the same class as DON. Here we show that overexpression of AtLTP4.4 in transgenic wheat significantly reduced F. graminearum growth in Bobwhite and RB07 lines in the greenhouse and reduced fungal lesion size in detached leaf assays. Hydrogen peroxide accumulation was attenuated upon exposure of transgenic wheat plants to DON, indicating that AtLTP4.4 may confer resistance by inhibiting oxidative stress. Field testing indicated that disease severity was significantly reduced in two transgenic Bobwhite lines expressing AtLTP4.4. DON accumulation was significantly reduced in four different transgenic Bobwhite lines expressing AtLTP4.4 or a wheat nsLTP, TaLTP3, which was previously shown to have antioxidant activity. Recombinant AtLTP4.4 purified from Pichia pastoris exhibited potent antifungal activity against F. graminearum. These results demonstrate that overexpression of AtLTP4.4 in transgenic wheat suppresses DON accumulation in the field. Suppression of DON induced reactive oxygen species by AtLTP4.4 might be the mechanism by which fungal spread and mycotoxin accumulation are inhibited in the transgenic wheat plants."

"33095257","abstracttext","Septoria Tritici Blotch, caused by the ascomycete fungus Zymoseptoria tritici, is a major threat to wheat production worldwide. The Z. tritici genome encodes many small, secreted proteins (ZtSSP) that likely play a key role in the successful colonisation of host tissues. However, few of these ZtSSPs have been functionally characterised for their role during infection. In this study, we identified and characterised a small, conserved cysteine-rich secreted effector from Zymoseptoria tritici which has homologues in other plant pathogens in the dothideomycetes. ZtSSP2 was expressed throughout Z. tritici infection in wheat with the highest levels observed early during infection. A yeast two-hybrid assay revealed an interaction between ZtSSP2 and wheat E3 ubiquitin ligase in yeast and this was further confirmed in planta using bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and co-immunoprecipitation. Down-regulation of this wheat E3 ligase using virus-induced gene silencing, increased the susceptibility of wheat to Septoria tritici blotch (STB). Together these results suggest that TaE3UBQ likely plays a role in plant immunity to defend against Z. tritici."

This study aimed to functionally characterize TaYS1A during the interaction of wheat and Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ), the causal agent of stripe rust disease. TaYS1A was localized in the cell membrane of wheat protoplasts and Nicotiana benthamiana cells. TaYS1A was significantly up-regulated in wheat leaves after being infected with the avirulent Pst isolate CYR23 and after treatment with salicylic acid (SA). Silencing of TaYS1A by the virus-induced gene silencing method enhanced the susceptibility of wheat to Pst accompanied by reducing the accumulation of SA and H 2 O 2 and down-regulating the transcriptions of TaPR1 and TaPR2 . In addition, TaYS1A was found to interact with TaNH2, a homolog of OsNH2, by yeast-two-hybrid assay, and silencing of TaYS1A diminished the expression of TaNH2 . Our findings suggested the existence of positive regulation of TaYS1A in providing resistance against Pst by modulating SA-induced signaling and offered new insight into the biological role of YSL in wheat against pathogens."

"15905993","abstracttext","Rye has one of the most efficient groups of genes for aluminum tolerance (Alt) among cultivated species of Triticeae. This tolerance is controlled by, at least, three independent and dominant loci (Alt1, Alt2, and Alt3) located on chromosome arms 6RS, 3RS, and 4RL, respectively. The segregation of Alt genes and several random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), Secale cereale inter-microsatellite (SCIM), and Secale cereale microsatellite (SCM) markers in three F(2) between a tolerant cultivar (AilÃ©s) and a non-tolerant inbred line (Riodeva) were studied. The segregation ratio obtained for aluminum tolerance in the three F(2) populations analyzed was 3:1 (tolerant:non-tolerant), indicating that tolerance is controlled by one dominant locus. SCIM811(1376) was linked to an Alt gene in the three F(2) populations studied, and three different SCIMs and one RAPD (SCIM811(1376), SCIM812(626), SCIM812(1138), and OPQ4(725)) were linked to the Alt gene in two F(2) populations. This result indicated that the same Alt gene was segregating in the three crosses. SCIM819(1434) and OPQ4(578) linked to the tolerance gene in one F(2) population were located using wheat-rye ditelosomic addition lines on the 7RS chromosome arm. The Alt locus is mapped between SCIM819(1434) and the OPQ4(578) markers. Two microsatellite loci (SCM-40 and SCM-86), previously located on chromosome 7R, were also linked to the Alt gene. Therefore, the Alt gene segregating in these F(2) populations is new and probably could be orthologous to the Alt genes located on wheat chromosome arm 4DL, on barley chromosome arm 4HL, on rye chromosome arm 4RL, and rice chromosome 3. This new Alt gene located on rye chromosome arm 7RS was named Alt4. A map of rye chromosome 7R with the Alt4 gene, 16 SCIM and RAPD, markers and two SCM markers was obtained."
"16270226","articletitle","The evolution of the abscisic acid-response in land plants: comparative analysis of group 1 LEA gene expression in moss and cereals."
"16270226","abstracttext","The moss Physcomitrella patens possesses a single copy of a Group 1 LEA gene, designated PpLEA-1. Sequence analysis of the PpLEA-1 gene reveals the gene to contain a single intron in a position conserved in all members of the Group 1 LEA gene family, but also to contain a premature termination codon within the first exon. Nevertheless, a PpLEA-1 transcript accumulates in moss tissues in response both to the imposition of osmotic stress, and to the plant growth regulator abscisic acid (ABA). This response appears to be mediated at the transcriptional level, and observation of the pattern of gene expression, reported by histochemical staining of plants expressing a PpLea-1::GUS transgene suggests that the promoter responds preferentially to ABA in protonemal filaments, whereas osmotic stress induces gene expression primarily in the gametophores. Quantitative analysis of promoter activity by transient expression in Physcomitrella protoplasts shows the PpLEA-1 promoter to be highly active in response to ABA and osmotic stress. ABA-mediated transgene expression from the PpLea-1 promoter occurs at a level similar to that driven by the highly active promoter of the wheat Group 1 LEA gene, E(m). Site-directed mutagenesis of the PpLEA-1 promoter indicates that ABA-inducibility is mediated via an ACGT-core motif similar to that seen in the ABA response elements of higher plant LEA genes. However, whereas the wheat E(m )promoter is active in moss tissues, the moss promoter is not reciprocally active in cereal cells: no activity, ABA-inducible or otherwise was detected in barley aleurone protoplasts transfected with the PpLEA-1::GUS construct. We propose that ABA activation of gene expression in moss cells represents an ancestral state, with only minimal requirements for promoter recognition, whereas cereal cells require the interaction of additional factors with ABA-responsive promoters."

Near-isogenic lines (NILs) with short target gene region are very important in molecular breeding and map-based cloning and can be developed by combining marker-assisted selection and conventional phenotypic identification. However, no Pm gene NILs were reported by using this method in the previous studies. A new broad-spectrum dominant resistance gene Pm2b , derived from the Chinese wheat breeding line KM2939, conferred high resistance to Pm at both the seedling and adult stages. In this study, with the aid of forward and background selection (FS and BS) using molecular markers, the Pm2b gene was introgressed into three elite susceptible commercial cultivars Shimai 15, Shixin 828, and Kenong 199 through the back-crossing procedure. With the appropriate backcrossing generations, selected population sizes and marker number for BS, the homozygous resistant BC 3 F 2:3 NILs of Pm2b gene in the three genetic backgrounds with the highest recipient genome composition of about 99%, confirmed by simple sequence repeat markers and 660K single nucleotide polymorphic array, were developed and evaluated for the powdery mildew resistance and agronomic traits. The different resistance and similar or improved agronomic performance between Pm2b NILs and their corresponding recurrent parents indicated their potential value in the marker-assisted breeding of the Pm2b gene. Moreover, the development of four flanked diagnostic markers (CFD81, BWM25, BWM20, and BWM21) of the Pm2 gene can effectively assist the forward selection and accelerate the transfer and use of this resistance gene."

"31462936","abstracttext_background","Transposable elements (TEs) can be key drivers of evolution, but the mechanisms and scope of how they impact gene and genome function are largely unknown. Previous analyses revealed that TE-mediated gene amplifications can have variable effects on fungal genomes, from inactivation of function to production of multiple active copies. For example, a DNA methyltransferase gene in the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici (synonym Mycosphaerella graminicola ) was amplified to tens of copies, all of which were inactivated by Repeat-Induced Point mutation (RIP) including the original, resulting in loss of cytosine methylation. In another wheat pathogen, Pyrenophora tritici-repentis , a histone H3 gene was amplified to tens of copies with little evidence of RIP, leading to many potentially active copies. To further test the effects of transposon-aided gene amplifications on genome evolution and architecture, the repetitive fraction of the significantly expanded genome of the banana pathogen, Pseudocercospora fijiensis , was analyzed in greater detail."
"31462936","abstracttext_results","These analyses identified a housekeeping gene, histone H3, which was captured and amplified to hundreds of copies by a hAT DNA transposon, all of which were inactivated by RIP, except for the original. In P. fijiensis the original H3 gene probably was not protected from RIP, but most likely was maintained intact due to strong purifying selection. Comparative analyses revealed that a similar event occurred in five additional genomes representing the fungal genera Cercospora , Pseudocercospora and Sphaerulina ."
"31462936","abstracttext_conclusions","These results indicate that the interplay of TEs and RIP can result in different and unpredictable fates of amplified genes, with variable effects on gene and genome evolution."
"15821882","articletitle","Stable expression of a defense-related gene in wheat epidermis under transcriptional control of a novel promoter confers pathogen resistance."
"15821882","abstracttext","Tissue-specific or regulated expression of transgenes is desirable in order to prevent pleiotropic side effects of putatively harmful transgene products as well as loss of energy resources due to unnecessary accumulation of transgene products. Epidermis-specific expression would be useful for many defense-related genes directed against attack by fungal pathogens that enter the plant body by direct penetration through the epidermis. In an approach to enhance resistance of wheat to the powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici, a novel epidermis-specific promoter was developed and used for expression of two defense-related genes. A 2.3 kb fragment of the wheat GstA1 promoter in combination with an intron-containing part of the wheat WIR1a gene was found to drive strong and constitutive transient expression in wheat epidermis. This promoter-intron combination was used for overexpression of oxalate oxidase 9f-2.8 and TaPERO peroxidase, two defense-related wheat genes expressed in inner leaf tissues. Expression studies of several transgenic lines by in situ oxalate-oxidase staining, RNA and protein blot analyses, as well as real-time PCR, demonstrated strong and constitutive transgene expression in the shoot epidermis. Transient as well as stable over-expression of the TaPERO peroxidase gene in wheat epidermis under the control of the GstA1i promoter resulted in enhanced resistance against Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici, whereas oxalate-oxidase overexpression had no effect in either system. The data suggest that the wheat GstA1 promoter in combination with the WIR1a intron is useful for transgenic approaches to fungal disease resistance in cereals."
"14663527","articletitle","Structural organization of the barley D-hordein locus in comparison with its orthologous regions of wheat genomes."
"14663527","abstracttext","D hordein, a prolamin storage protein of barley endosperms, is highly homologous to the high molecular weight (HWM) glutenin subunits, which are the major determinants of bread-making quality in wheat flour. In hexaploid wheat (AABBDD), each genome contains two paralogous copies of HMW-glutenin genes that encode the x- and y-type HMW-glutenin subunits. Previously, we reported the sequence analysis of a 102-kb genomic region that contains the HMW-glutenin locus of the D genome from Aegilops tauschii, the donor of the D genome of hexaploid wheat. Here, we present the sequence analysis of a 120-kb D-hordein region of the barley genome, a more distantly related member of the Triticeae grass tribe. Comparative sequence analysis revealed that gene content and order are generally conserved. Genes included in both of these orthologous regions are arranged in the following order: a Xa21-like receptor kinase, an endosperm globulin, an HMW prolamin, and a serine (threonine) protein kinase. However, in the wheat D genome, a region containing both the globulin and HMW-glutenin gene was duplicated, indicating that this duplication event occurred after the separation of the wheat and barley genomes. The intergenic regions are divergent with regard to the sequence and structural organization. It was found that different types of retroelements are responsible for the intergenic structure divergence in the wheat and barley genomes. In the barley region, we identified 16 long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons in three distinct nested clusters. These retroelements account for 63% of the contig sequence. In addition, barley D hordein was compared with wheat HMW glutenins in terms of cysteine residue conservation and repeat domain organization."

"14617076","abstracttext","Colinearity in gene content and order between rice and closely related grass species has emerged as a powerful tool for gene identification. Using a comparative genetics approach, we have identified the rice genomic region syntenous to the region deleted in the wheat chromosome pairing mutant ph2a, with a view to identifying genes at the Ph2 locus that control meiotic processes. Utilising markers known to reside within the region deleted in ph2a, and data from wheat, barley and rice genetic maps, markers delimiting the region deleted on wheat chromosome 3DS in the ph2a mutant were used to locate the syntenous region on the short arm of rice chromosome 1. A contig of rice genomic sequence was identified from publicly available sequence information and used in blast searches to identify wheat expressed sequence tags (ESTs) exhibiting significant similarity. Southern analysis using a subset of identified wheat ESTs confirmed a syntenous relationship between the rice and wheat genomic regions and defined precisely the extent of the deleted segment in the ph2a mutant. A 6.58-Mb rice contig generated from 60 overlapping rice chromosome 1 P1 artificial chromosome (PAC) clones spanning the syntenous rice region has enabled identification of 218 wheat ESTs putatively located in the region deleted in ph2a. What seems to be a terminal deletion on chromosome 3DS is estimated to be 80 Mb in length. Putative candidate genes that may contribute to the altered meiotic phenotype of ph2a are discussed."

"16333611","abstracttext","When a crop hybridizes with a wild relative, the potential for stable transmission to the wild of any crop gene is directly related to the frequency of crop-wild homoeologous pairing for the chromosomal region where it is located within the crop genome. Pairing pattern at metaphase I (MI) has been examined in durum wheat x Aegilops geniculata interspecific hybrids (2n=4x=ABUgMg) by means of a genomic in-situ hybridization procedure that resulted in simultaneous discrimination of A, B and wild genomes. The level of MI pairing in the hybrids varied greatly depending on the crop genotype. However, their pattern of homoeologous association was very similar, with a frequency of wheat-wild association close to 60% in all genotype combinations. A-wild represented 80-85% of wheat-wild associations which supports that, on average, A genome sequences are much more likely to be transferred to this wild relative following interspecific hybridization and backcrossing. Combination of genomic DNA probes and the ribosomal pTa71 probe has allowed to determine the MI pairing behaviour of the major NOR-bearing chromosomes in these hybrids (1 B, 6B, 1 Ug and 5 Ug), in addition to wheat chromosome 4A which could be identified with the sole use of genomic probes. The MI pairing pattern of the wild chromosome arms individually examined has confirmed a higher chance of gene escape from the wheat A genome. However, a wide variation regarding the amount of wheat-wild MI pairing among the specific wheat chromosome regions under analysis suggests that the study should be extended to other homoeologous groups."

"18943734","abstracttext","Gibberella zeae, a causal agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat and barley, is one of the most economically harmful pathogens of cereals in the United States. In recent years, the known host range of G. zeae has also expanded to noncereal crops. However, there is a lack of information on the population genetic structure of G. zeae associated with noncereal crops and across wheat cultivars. To test the hypothesis that G. zeae populations sampled from barley, wheat, potato, and sugar beet in the Upper Midwest of the United States are not mixtures of species or G. zeae clades, we analyzed sequence data of G. zeae, and confirmed that all populations studied were present in the same clade of G. zeae. Ten variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) markers were used to determine the genetic structure of G. zeae from the four crop populations. To examine the effect of wheat cultivars on the pathogen populations, 227 strains were sampled from 10 subpopulations according to wheat cultivar types. The VNTR markers also were used to analyze the genetic structure of these subpopulations. In all populations, gene (H = 0.453 to 0.612) and genotype diversity (GD = or >0.984) were high. There was little or no indication of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in all G. zeae populations and subpopulations. In addition, high gene flow (Nm) values were observed between cereal and noncereal populations (Nm = 10.69) and between FHB resistant and susceptible wheat cultivar subpopulations (Nm = 16.072), suggesting low population differentiation of G. zeae in this region. Analysis of molecular variance also revealed high genetic variation (>80%) among individuals within populations and subpopulations. However, low genetic variation (<5%) was observed between cereal and noncereal populations and between resistant and susceptible wheat subpopulations. Overall, these results suggest that the populations or subpopulations are likely a single large population of G. zeae affecting crops in the upper Midwest of the United States."

"18705883","abstracttext","Gene technology can offer creative solutions to problems of agronomical relevance, which may not be solved by conventional breeding methods. One of the major problems of wheat cultivation is disease caused by a number of fungal pathogens including the wheat powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici (Bgt). Transgenic wheat plants that constitutively express the coding sequence of the defence-related wheat peroxidase TaPrx103 (previously TaPERO) in shoot epidermis under the control of the wheat GstA1 promoter were generated and found to exhibit enhanced resistance to Bgt (Altpeter et al., Plant. Mol. Biol. 57, 271-283). Here, I report on physiological and molecular analyses of these plants in order to assess the mode of action of the peroxidase encoded by the TaGstA1:TaPrx103 transgene. Epidermal cells of transgenic lines with enhanced resistance were found to respond to Bgt attack more frequently with hypersensitive cell death and the generation of hydrogen peroxide. By contrast, resistance of epidermal cell walls to degradation by fungal enzymes appeared to be similar in transgenic and wild-type plants. Moreover, the analysis of the abundance of approximately 10,000 wheat transcripts revealed no significant effect of the GstA1i:TaPrx103 transgene on host gene expression in non-inoculated leaves and only a marginal effect in Bgt-challenged leaves, compared with wild-type plants treated in the same manner. The results indicate that the TaPrx103 protein is involved in generating reactive oxygen species specifically in pathogen-attacked cells, which may lead to localized cell death and resistance. I therefore suggest that the transgenic plants presented here can be regarded as substantially equivalent to non-transgenic wheat."

"20374525","abstracttext","Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV), vectored by Wheat curl mite, has been of great economic importance in the Great Plains of the United States and Canada. Recently, the virus has been identified in Australia, where it has spread quickly to all major wheat growing areas. The difficulties in finding adequate natural resistance in wheat prompted us to develop transgenic resistance based on RNA interference (RNAi). An RNAi construct was designed to target the nuclear inclusion protein 'a' (NIa) gene of WSMV. Wheat was stably cotransformed with two plasmids: pStargate-NIa expressing hairpin RNA (hpRNA) including WSMV sequence and pCMneoSTLS2 with the nptII selectable marker. When T(1) progeny were assayed against WSMV, ten of sixteen families showed complete resistance in transgenic segregants. The resistance was classified as immunity by four criteria: no disease symptoms were produced; ELISA readings were as in uninoculated plants; viral sequences could not be detected by RT-PCR from leaf extracts; and leaf extracts failed to give infections in susceptible plants when used in test-inoculation experiments. Southern blot hybridization analysis indicated hpRNA transgene integrated into the wheat genome. Moreover, accumulation of small RNAs derived from the hpRNA transgene sequence positively correlated with immunity. We also showed that the selectable marker gene nptII segregated independently of the hpRNA transgene in some transgenics, and therefore demonstrated that it is possible using these techniques, to produce marker-free WSMV immune transgenic plants. This is the first report of immunity in wheat to WSMV using a spliceable intron hpRNA strategy."

"20827456","abstracttext","The MRN complex plays a central role in the DNA repair pathways of eukaryotic cells and takes part in many other processes, including cell cycle checkpoint signalling, meiosis, DNA replication and telomere maintenance. This complex is formed by the interaction of the products of the Mre11, Rad50 and Nbs1 genes. This paper reports the molecular characterization, expression and interactions of the Rad50 gene in several wheat species with different levels of ploidy. The homoeologous Rad50 wheat genes were found to show a high level of conservation. Most of the RAD50 domains and motifs previously described in other species were also present in wheat RAD50; these proteins are therefore likely to have similar functions. Interactions between the RAD50 wheat proteins and their MRE11 counterparts in the MRN complex were observed. The level of expression of Rad50 in each of the species examined was determined and compared with those previously reported for the Mre11 genes. In some cases similar levels of expression were seen, as expected. The expression of the RAD50 homoeologous genes was assessed in two polyploid wheat species using quantitative PCR. In both cases, an overexpression of the Rad50B gene was detected. Although the results indicate the maintenance of function of these species' three homoeologous Rad50 genes, the biased expression of Rad50B might indicate ongoing silencing of one or both other homoeologues in polyploid wheat. To assess the consequences of such silencing on the formation of the MRN complex, the interactions between individual homoeologues of Rad50 and their genomic counterpart Mre11 genes were examined. The results indicate the inexistence of genomic specificity in the interactions between these genes. This would guarantee the formation of an MRN complex in wheat."

"21347655","abstracttext","The emergence of a new highly virulent race of stem rust (Puccinia graminis tritici), Ug99, rapid evolution of new Ug99 derivative races overcoming resistance of widely deployed genes, and spread towards important wheat growing areas now potentially threaten world food security. Exploiting novel genes effective against Ug99 from wild relatives of wheat is one of the most promising strategies for the protection of the wheat crop. A new source of resistance to Ug99 was identified in the short arm of the Aegilops searsii chromosome 3S(s) by screening wheat- Ae. searsii introgression libraries available as individual chromosome and chromosome arm additions to the wheat genome. For transferring this resistance gene into common wheat, we produced three double-monosomic chromosome populations (3A/3S(s), 3B/3S(s) and 3D/3S(s)) and then applied integrated stem rust screening, molecular maker analysis, and cytogenetic analysis to identify resistant wheat-Ae. searsii Robertsonian translocation. Three Robertsonian translocations (T3ALÂ·3S(s)S, T3BLÂ·3S(s)S and T3DLÂ·3S(s)S) and one recombinant (T3DS-3S(s)SÂ·3S(s)L) with stem rust resistance were identified and confirmed to be genetically compensating on the basis of genomic in situ hybridization, analysis of 3A, 3B, 3D and 3S(s)S-specific SSR/STS-PCR markers, and C-banding. In addition, nine SSR/STS-PCR markers of 3S(s)S-specific were developed for marker-assisted selection of the resistant gene. Efforts to reduce potential linkage drag associated with 3S(s)S of Ae. searsii are currently under way."

"23873186","abstracttext","Based on the similarity in gene structure between rice and wheat, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based landmark unique gene (PLUG) system enabled us to design primer sets that amplify wheat genic sequences including introns. From the previously reported wheat PLUG markers, we chose 144 markers that are distributed on different chromosomes and in known chromosomal regions (bins) to obtain rye-specific PCR-based markers. We conducted PCR with the 144 primer sets and the template of the Imperial rye genomic DNA and found that 131 (91.0%) primer sets successfully amplified PCR products. Of the 131 PLUG markers, 110 (76.4%) markers showed rye-specific PCR amplification with or without restriction enzyme digestion. We assigned 79 of the 110 markers to seven rye chromosomes (1R to 7R) using seven wheat-rye (cv. Imperial) chromosome addition and substitution lines: 12 to 1R, 8 to 2R, 11 to 3R, 8 to 4R, 16 to 5R, 12 to 6R, and 12 to 7R. Furthermore, we located their positions on the short or long (L) chromosome arm, using 13 Imperial rye telosomic lines of common wheat (except for 3RL). Referring to the chromosome bin locations of the 79 PLUG markers in wheat, we deduced the syntenic relationships between rye and wheat chromosomes. We also discussed chromosomal rearrangements in the rye genome with reference to the cytologically visible chromosomal gaps."
"23591078","articletitle","Anoxia promotes gravitropic curvature in rice pulvini but inhibits it in wheat and oat pulvini."
"23591078","abstracttext","Gravitropic curvature of pulvini of wheat and oat stem segments gradually declined with decreasing atmospheric Oâ concentration and was almost completely blocked under anoxia, whereas that of rice stem segments was enhanced under hypoxia and anoxia. Anoxia substantially increased the ethanol content in pulvini of gravistimulated stem segments in rice, wheat and oat, but the ethanol content showed no marked difference between rice pulvini and wheat and oat pulvini. The concentrations of exogenous ethanol and acetaldehyde required to inhibit the gravitropic curvature of pulvini were significantly higher in rice segments than in wheat and oat segments. However, in all three species, the concentrations of ethanol and acetaldehyde required to completely inhibit curvature were several-fold higher than the endogenous levels that accumulated in pulvini gravistimulated in Nâ. The pulvini of rice segments gravistimulated in Nâ did not contain much more ATP than those of wheat or oat segments gravistimulated in Nâ. When applied unilaterally to the pulvini of vertically oriented stem segments incubated in Nâ, indole-3-acetic acid induced bending in rice stem segments but not in wheat and oat stem segments. Transference of graviresponsive pulvini of rice, as well as those of wheat and oat, from aerobic conditions to anaerobic conditions led to cessation of gravitropic curvature within several minutes, but subsequently only gravitropic curvature of anoxic rice pulvini was completely recovered within 2 h. A large portion of this recovery was blocked by cordycepin, a transcription inhibitor. These results suggested that anoxia-induced expression of any gene or genes enables rice pulvini to respond to gravistimulation under anaerobic conditions, and that such a gene or genes might be unrelated to ethanol fermentation and ATP production in anaerobic conditions."

"24034075","abstracttext_background","Aluminium (Al) toxicity is considered to be one of the major constraints affecting crop productivity on acid soils. Being a trait governed by multiple genes, the identification and characterization of novel transcription factors (TFs) regulating the expression of entire response networks is a very promising approach. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to clone, localize, and characterize the TaSTOP1 gene, which belongs to the zinc finger family (Cys2His2 type) transcription factor, at molecular level in bread wheat."
"24034075","abstracttext_results","TaSTOP1 loci were cloned and localized on the long arm of homoeologous group 3 chromosomes [3AL (TaSTOP1-A), 3BL (TaSTOP1-B) and 3DL (TaSTOP1-D)] in bread wheat. TaSTOP1 showed four potential zinc finger domains and the homoeologue TaSTOP1-A exhibited transactivation activity in yeast. Expression profiling of TaSTOP1 transcripts identified the predominance of homoeologue TaSTOP1-A followed by TaSTOP1-D over TaSTOP1-B in root and only predominance of TaSTOP1-A in shoot tissues of two diverse bread wheat genotypes. Al and proton (H(+)) stress appeared to slightly modulate the transcript of TaSTOP1 homoeologues expression in both genotypes of bread wheat."
"24034075","abstracttext_conclusions","Physical localization of TaSTOP1 results indicated the presence of a single copy of TaSTOP1 on homoeologous group 3 chromosomes in bread wheat. The three homoeologues of TaSTOP1 have similar genomic structures, but showed biased transcript expression and different response to Al and proton (H(+)) toxicity. These results indicate that TaSTOP1 homoeologues may differentially contribute under Al or proton (H(+)) toxicity in bread wheat. Moreover, it seems that TaSTOP1-A transactivation potential is constitutive and may not depend on the presence/absence of Al at least in yeast. Finally, the localization of TaSTOP1 on long arm of homoeologous group 3 chromosomes and the previously reported major loci associated with Al resistance at chromosome 3BL, through QTL and genome wide association mapping studies suggests that TaSTOP1 could be a potential candidate gene for genomic assisted breeding for Al tolerance in bread wheat."

"25846875","abstracttext","Functional markers (FMs) developed from sequence polymorphisms are present in allelic variants of a functional gene at a locus and are directly associated with phenotypic variations. In this study, FM linked to Rht-B1, Rht-D1, TaCwi-A1, TaSus2-2B, TaGW2-6A and Dreb-B1 genes conferring to yield potential and water-saving were selected to analyse the distribution in 102 wheat varieties, most of which were authorized in the past decade and adapted to grow in Zone II of China. First, the semidwarfing genes Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b (mutant alleles) conferring to grain yield were analysed. The frequencies of favourable alleles Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b were 32.4 and 58.8%, respectively. Comparing with the previous report, the frequency of Rht-B1b among cultivars in this study is similar to the frequency among cultivars released in the 1990s, while the frequency of Rht-D1b is slightly lower than the previous report 63.9%. Twelve (11.8%) cultivars neither contained Rht-B1b nor Rht-D1b, while only Yumai 66 contained both semidwarfing genes. Linyuan8 and Xinong 928 are heterozygous at RhtB1 locus and Zhengmai 9023 is heterozygous at both RhtB1 and Rht-D1 loci. Second, the TaCwi-A1, TaSus2-2B and TaGW2-6A genes considered as candidate genes related to grain weight were detected. We found that the frequencies of the favourable alleles were 76.5, 56.9 and 69.6%, respectively. Among the 102 wheat varieties, 30 contained all the three favourable genes, 45 contained two of the three favourable genes and 27 contained only one. There are eight wheat varieties (7.8%) in hybrid state at the TaCWI-A1 locus. Third, the designed FM linked to water-saving gene Dreb-B1 were validated on 102 wheat varieties. The results showed that the haplotypes of 47 wheat varieties at the Dreb-B1 locus were same as that of Opata 85, and 55 wheat varieties showed the signal expected for W7984 (Opata 85 and W7984 are parents of the ITMI mapping population). This information will be useful for the wheat breeding programmes aiming at improving yield and water use efficiency in Shijiazhuang located in China Zone II."

"25899305","abstracttext_key message","This study cloned two novel TaLox genes on chromosome of 4BS and developed a co-dominant marker, Lox-B23, in bread wheat that showed highly significant association with lipoxygenase activity. Lipoxygenase (Lox), a critical enzyme in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, significantly influences the color and processing quality of wheat-based products. Two novel Lox genes, designated TaLox-B2 and TaLox-B3, were cloned on chromosome 4BS of Chinese bread wheat. The deduced amino acid sequence showed that both TaLox-B2 and TaLox-B3 genes encoded an 861-aa protein and possessed a lipoxygenase superfamily domain at the 170-838 interval. Two different TaLox-B2 alleles, designated TaLox-B2a and TaLox-B2b, were subsequently discovered. A co-dominant marker, Lox-B23, was developed based on sequences of TaLox-B2a, TaLox-B2b, and TaLox-B3 genes to precisely distinguish these three alleles in Chinese bread cultivars. Among five allelic combinations of Lox genes at Lox-B1, Lox-B2, and Lox-B3 loci, wheat cultivars with TaLox-B1a/TaLox-B2a/TaLox-B3a combination exhibited the highest Lox activity, whereas those with TaLox-B1a/TaLox-B2b/TaLox-B3b combination significantly showed the lowest Lox activity. A RIL population was used to evaluate the influence of TaLox-B3a gene on Lox activity. Results showed that TaLox-B3a gene could significantly increase the Lox activity in bread wheat. Physical mapping indicated that both TaLox-B2 and TaLox-B3 genes were located on chromosome 4BS in bread wheat. This study provides useful information to further understand the molecular and genetic bases of Lox activity in bread wheat."

"26883045","abstracttext_key message","Across 13 experiments the gw2 - A1 mutant allele shifts grain size distribution consistently across all grains significantly increasing grain weight (6.6Â %), width (2.8Â %) and length (2.1Â %) in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. There is an urgent need to identify, understand and incorporate alleles that benefit yield in polyploid wheat. The rice OsGW2 gene functions as a negative regulator of grain weight and width and is homologous to the wheat TaGW2 gene. Previously it was shown that transcript levels of the A-genome homoeologue, TaGW2-A1, are negatively associated with grain width in hexaploid wheat. In this study we screened the tetraploid Kronos TILLING population to identify mutants in TaGW2-A1. We identified a G to A transition in the splice acceptor site of exon 5 which leads to mis-splicing in TaGW2-A1. We backcrossed the mutant allele into tetraploid and hexaploid wheat and generated a series of backcross derived isogenic lines which were evaluated in glasshouse and field conditions. Across 13 experiments the GW2-A1 mutant allele significantly increased thousand grain weight (6.6Â %), grain width (2.8Â %) and grain length (2.1Â %) in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat compared to the wild type allele. In hexaploid wheat, this led to an increase in spike yield since no differences were detected for spikelet or grain number between isogenic lines. The increase in grain width and length was consistent across grains of different sizes, suggesting that the effect of the mutation is stable across the ear and within spikelets. Differences in carpel size and weight between alleles were identified as early as 5Â days before anthesis, suggesting that TaGW2-A1 acts on maternal tissue before anthesis to restrict seed size. A single nucleotide polymorphism marker was developed to aid the deployment of the mutant allele into breeding programmes."

"28443114","abstracttext","Very few LTPs have been shown to act through plasma membrane receptors or to be involved in the hypersensitive response (HR). DIR1, a new type of plant LTP interacts with lipids in vitro , moves to distant tissues during systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and therefore is thought to be involved in long-distance signaling during SAR. However, the exact functions of DIR1 orthologs in cereal species under biotic and abiotic stresses have not been thoroughly defined. In this study, a novel wheat ortholog of the DIR1 gene, TaDIR1-2, was isolated from Suwon11, a Chinese cultivar of wheat and functionally characterized. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that TaDIR1-2 is clustered within the nsLTP-Type II group and shows a closer relationship with DIR1 orthologs from monocots than from eudicots. TaDIR1-2 was localized in the cytoplasm and the cell membrane of wheat mesophyll protoplast. Transcription of TaDIR1-2 was detected in wheat roots, stems and leaves. TaDIR1-2 transcript was significantly induced during the compatible interaction of wheat with the stripe rust pathogen, Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). Treatments with salicylic acid (SA) and low temperature significantly up-regulated the expression of TaDIR1-2. Transient overexpression of TaDIR1-2 did not induce cell death or suppress Bax-induced cell death in tobacco leaves. Knocking down the expression of TaDIR1-2 through virus-induced gene silencing increased wheat resistance to Pst accompanied by HR, increased accumulation of H 2 O 2 and SA, increased expression of TaPR1, TaPR2, TaPAL, and TaNOX, and decreased expression of two reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging genes TaCAT and TaSOD. Our results suggest that TaDIR1-2 acts as a negative regulator in wheat resistance to Pst by modulating ROS and/or SA-induced signaling."

"29470621","abstracttext_key message","The fungus Parastagonospora nodorum causes Septoria nodorum blotch (SNB) of wheat. A genetically diverse wheat panel was used to dissect the complexity of SNB and identify novel sources of resistance. The fungus Parastagonospora nodorum is the causal agent of Septoria nodorum blotch (SNB) of wheat. The pathosystem is mediated by multiple fungal necrotrophic effector-host sensitivity gene interactions that include SnToxA-Tsn1, SnTox1-Snn1, and SnTox3-Snn3. A P. nodorum strain lacking SnToxA, SnTox1, and SnTox3 (toxa13) retained wild-type-like ability to infect some modern wheat cultivars, suggesting evidence of other effector-mediated susceptibility gene interactions or the lack of host resistance genes. To identify genomic regions harbouring such loci, we examined a panel of 295 historic wheat accessions from the N. I. Vavilov Institute of Plant Genetic Resources in Russia, which is comprised of genetically diverse landraces and breeding lines registered from 1920 to 1990. The wheat panel was subjected to effector bioassays, infection with P. nodorum wild type (SN15) and toxa13. In general, SN15 was more virulent than toxa13. Insensitivity to all three effectors contributed significantly to resistance against SN15, but not toxa13. Genome-wide association studies using phenotypes from SN15 infection detected quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes 1BS (Snn1), 2DS, 5AS, 5BS (Snn3), 3AL, 4AL, 4BS, and 7AS. For toxa13 infection, a QTL was detected on 5AS (similar to SN15), plus two additional QTL on 2DL and 7DL. Analysis of resistance phenotypes indicated that plant breeders may have inadvertently selected for effector insensitivity from 1940 onwards. We identify accessions that can be used to develop bi-parental mapping populations to characterise resistance-associated alleles for subsequent introgression into modern bread wheat to minimise the impact of SNB."

"28143400","abstracttext_background","In plants carotenoids play an important role in the photosynthetic process and photo-oxidative protection, and are the substrate for the synthesis of abscisic acid and strigolactones. In addition to their protective role as antioxidants and precursors of vitamin A, in wheat carotenoids are important as they influence the colour (whiteness vs. yellowness) of the grain. Understanding the genetic basis of grain yellow pigments, and identifying associated markers provide the basis for improving wheat quality by molecular breeding."
"28143400","abstracttext_results","Twenty-four candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis and catabolism of carotenoid compounds have been identified in wheat by comparative genomics. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found in the coding sequences of 19 candidate genes allowed their chromosomal location and accurate map position on two reference consensus maps to be determined. The genome-wide association study based on genotyping a tetraploid wheat collection with 81,587 gene-associated SNPs validated quantitative trait loci (QTLs) previously detected in biparental populations and discovered new QTLs for grain colour-related traits. Ten carotenoid genes mapped in chromosome regions underlying pigment content QTLs indicating possible functional relationships between candidate genes and the trait."
"28143400","abstracttext_conclusions","The availability of linked, candidate gene-based markers can facilitate breeding wheat cultivars with desirable levels of carotenoids. Identifying QTLs linked to carotenoid pigmentation can contribute to understanding genes underlying carotenoid accumulation in the wheat kernels. Together these outputs can be combined to exploit the genetic variability of colour-related traits for the nutritional and commercial improvement of wheat products."

"29103142","abstracttext_key message","High-throughput genotyping of Swiss bread wheat and spelt accessions revealed differences in their gene pools and identified bread wheat landraces that were not used in breeding. Genebanks play a pivotal role in preserving the genetic diversity present among old landraces and wild progenitors of modern crops and they represent sources of agriculturally important genes that were lost during domestication and in modern breeding. However, undesirable genes that negatively affect crop performance are often co-introduced when landraces and wild crop progenitors are crossed with elite cultivars, which often limit the use of genebank material in modern breeding programs. A detailed genetic characterization is an important prerequisite to solve this problem and to make genebank material more accessible to breeding. Here, we genotyped 502 bread wheat and 293 spelt accessions held in the Swiss National Genebank using a 15K wheat SNP array. The material included both spring and winter wheats and consisted of old landraces and modern cultivars. Genome- and sub-genome-wide analyses revealed that spelt and bread wheat form two distinct gene pools. In addition, we identified bread wheat landraces that were genetically distinct from modern cultivars. Such accessions were possibly missed in the early Swiss wheat breeding program and are promising targets for the identification of novel genes. The genetic information obtained in this study is appropriate to perform genome-wide association studies, which will facilitate the identification and transfer of agriculturally important genes from the genebank into modern cultivars through marker-assisted selection."

"31064324","abstracttext_background","The BBAA subgenomes of hexaploid common wheat are structurally intact, which makes it possible to extract the BBAA subgenomes to constitute a novel plant type, namely, extracted tetraploid wheat (ETW). ETW displays multiple abnormal phenotypes such as massively reduced biomass and abnormal spike development, compared to extant tetraploid wheat with a BBAA genome. The genetic, biochemical and physiological basis underlying the phenotypic abnormality of ETW remains unknown."
"31064324","abstracttext_results","To explore the biochemical basis of these phenotypic abnormalities, we analysed the metabolomic and proteomic profiles and quantified 46 physiological traits of ETW in comparison with its common wheat donor (genome BBAADD), and a durum tetraploid wheat cultivar (genome BBAA). Among these three types of wheat, ETW showed a saliently different pattern of nutrient accumulation and seed quality, markedly lower concentrations of many metabolites involved in carbohydrate metabolism, and higher concentrations of many metabolites related to amino acids. Among the metabolites, changes in shikimate and sucrose were the most conspicuous. Higher levels of shikimate and lower levels of sucrose influence many metabolic processes including carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, which may contribute to the phenotypic abnormalities. Gene expression assay showed downregulation of a shikimate degradation enzyme (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) coding gene and upregulation of several genes coding for the sucrose hydrolysis enzyme, which could explain the higher levels of shikimate and lower levels of sucrose, respectively."

"32344734","abstracttext","Determining the distribution and correspondence of genome-scale homologous genes in wheat are effective ways to uncover chromosome rearrangement that has occurred during crop evolution and domestication, which can contribute to improvements in crop breeding. High-resolution and comprehensive analysis of the wheat genome by the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) revealed a total of 88,733 high-confidence homologous genes of four major types (1:1:1, 1:1:0, 0:1:1 and 1:0:1) among the A, B and D subgenomes of wheat. This data was used to compare homologous gene densities among chromosomes, clarify their distribution and correspondence relationship, and compare their functional enrichment. The average density of 1:1:1 homologous genes was about 10 times more than the density of the other three types of homologous genes, although the homologous gene densities of the various chromosomes were similar within each homologous type. Three regions of exceptional density were detected in 1:1:1 homologous genes, the isolate peak on the tail of chromosome 4A, and the desert regions at the start of chromosome 7A and 7D. The correspondence between homologous genes of the wheat subgenomes demonstrated translocation between the tail segments of chromosome 4A and 5A, and the inversion of the segment of original 5A and 7B into the tail of 4A. The homologous genes on the inserting segments of 5A and 7B to 4A were highly enriched in nitrogen, primary metabolite and small molecular metabolism processes, compared with genes on other regions of the original 4A chromosome. This study provides a refined genome-scale reference of homologous genes for wheat molecular research and breeding, which will help to broaden the application of the wheat genome and can be used as a template for research on other polyploid plants."

"32548810","abstracttext","Group-1 homoelog genes in wheat genomes encode storage proteins and are the major determinants of wheat product properties. Consequently, understanding the genetic diversity of group-1 homoelogs and genes encoding storage proteins, especially the low-molecular-weight glutenins (LMW-GSs), within wheat landrace genomes is necessary to further improve the quality of modern wheat crops. The genetic diversity of group-1 homoelogs in 75 Xinjiang winter wheat landraces was evaluated by Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) markers. These data were used to select 15 landraces for additional LMW-GS gene isolation. The genetic similarity coefficients among landraces were highly similar regardless if considering the diversity markers on 1A, 1B, and 1D chromosomes individually or using all of the markers together. These similarities were evinced by the generation of four similar cluster dendrograms that comprised 11-15 landrace groups, regardless of the dataset used to generate the dendrograms. A total of 105 LMW-GS sequences corresponding to 79 unique genes were identified overall by using primers designed to target Glu-A3 and Glu-B3 loci, and 54 mature proteins were predicted from the unique LMW-GS genes. Nine novel chimeric LMW-GS genes were also identified, of which, one was recombinant for -i/-m, one for -s/-m, and seven for -m/-m parent genes, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis separated all of the LMW-GSs into three clades that were supported by moderate bootstrap values (> 70%). The clades corresponded to LMW-GS genes primarily harboring different N-terminals. These results provide useful information for better understanding the evolutionary genetics of the important Glu-3 locus of wheat, and they also provide new novel gene targets that can potentially be exploited to improve wheat quality."

"30143505","abstracttext","In the present study, we investigated whether reducing the particle size of wheat bran affects the colonizing microbial community using batch fermentations with cecal inocula from seven different chickens. We also investigated the effect of in-feed administration of regular wheat bran (WB; 1,690 Î¼m) and wheat bran with reduced particle size (WB280; 280 Î¼m) on the cecal microbial community composition of broilers. During batch fermentation, WB280 was colonized by a lactic acid-producing community ( Bifidobacteriaceae and Lactobacillaceae ) and by Lachnospiraceae that contain lactic acid-consuming butyric acid-producing species. The relative abundances of the Enterobacteriaceae decreased in the particle-associated communities for both WB and WB280 compared to that of the control. In addition, the community attached to wheat bran was enriched in xylan-degrading bacteria. When administered as a feed additive to broilers, WB280 significantly increased the richness of the cecal microbiota and the abundance of bacteria containing the butyryl-coenzyme A (CoA):acetate CoA-transferase gene, a key gene involved in bacterial butyrate production, while decreasing the abundances of Enterobacteriaceae family members in the ceca. Particle size reduction of wheat bran thus resulted in the colonization of the bran particles by a very specific lactic acid- and butyric acid-producing community and can be used to steer toward beneficial microbial shifts. This can potentially increase the resilience against pathogens and increase animal performance when the reduced-particle-size wheat bran is administered as a feed additive to broilers. IMPORTANCE Prebiotic dietary fibers are known to improve the gastrointestinal health of both humans and animals in many different ways. They can increase the bulking capacity, improve transit times, and, depending on the fiber, even stimulate the growth and activity of resident beneficial bacteria. Wheat bran is a readily available by-product of flour processing and is a highly concentrated source of (in)soluble dietary fiber. The intake of fiber-rich diets has been associated with increased Firmicutes and decreased Proteobacteria numbers. Here, we show that applying only 1% of a relatively simple substrate which was technically modified using relatively simple techniques reduces the concentration of Enterobacteriaceae This could imply that in future intervention studies, one should take the particle size of dietary fibers into account."
"30564262","articletitle","Genome-Wide Transcription During Early Wheat Meiosis Is Independent of Synapsis, Ploidy Level, and the Ph1 Locus."
"30564262","abstracttext","Polyploidization is a fundamental process in plant evolution. One of the biggest challenges faced by a new polyploid is meiosis, particularly discriminating between multiple related chromosomes so that only homologous chromosomes synapse and recombine to ensure regular chromosome segregation and balanced gametes. Despite its large genome size, high DNA repetitive content and similarity between homoeologous chromosomes, hexaploid wheat completes meiosis in a shorter period than diploid species with a much smaller genome. Therefore, during wheat meiosis, mechanisms additional to the classical model based on DNA sequence homology, must facilitate more efficient homologous recognition. One such mechanism could involve exploitation of differences in chromosome structure between homologs and homoeologs at the onset of meiosis. In turn, these chromatin changes, can be expected to be linked to transcriptional gene activity. In this study, we present an extensive analysis of a large RNA-seq data derived from six different genotypes: wheat, wheat-rye hybrids and newly synthesized octoploid triticale, both in the presence and absence of the Ph1 locus. Plant material was collected at early prophase, at the transition leptotene-zygotene, when the telomere bouquet is forming and synapsis between homologs is beginning. The six genotypes exhibit different levels of synapsis and chromatin structure at this stage; therefore, recombination and consequently segregation, are also different. Unexpectedly, our study reveals that neither synapsis, whole genome duplication nor the absence of the Ph1 locus are associated with major changes in gene expression levels during early meiotic prophase. Overall wheat transcription at this meiotic stage is therefore highly resilient to such alterations, even in the presence of major chromatin structural changes. Further studies in wheat and other polyploid species will be required to reveal whether these observations are specific to wheat meiosis."

"32398647","abstracttext","Heat shock proteins (HSPs) have a significant role in protein foldingÂ and are considered as prominent candidates for development of heat-tolerant crops. Understanding of wheat HSPs has great importance since wheat is severely affected by heat stress, particularly during the grain filling stage. In the present study, efforts were made to identify HSPs in wheat and to understand their role during plant development and under different stress conditions. HSPs in wheat genome were first identified by using Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSMs) of known HSP domains and then also confirmed by sequence homology with already known HSPs. Collectively, 753 TaHSPs including 169 TaSHSP, 273 TaHSP40, 95 TaHSP60, 114 TaHSP70, 18 TaHSP90 and 84 TaHSP100 were identified in the wheat genome. Compared with other grass species, number of HSPs in wheat was relatively high probably due to the higher ploidy level. Large number of tandem duplication was identified in TaHSPs, especially TaSHSPs. The TaHSP genes showed random distribution on chromosomes, however, there were more TaHSPs in B and D sub-genomes as compared to the A sub-genome. Extensive computational analysis was performed using the available genomic resources to understand gene structure, gene expression and phylogentic relationship of TaHSPs. Interestingly, apart from high expression under heat stress, high expression of TaSHSP was also observed during seed development. The study provided a list of candidate HSP genes for improving thermo tolerance during developmental stages and also for understanding the seed development process in bread wheat."

"31630318","abstracttext","Genetic diversity is crucial for successful adaptation and sustained improvement in crops. India is bestowed with diverse agro-climatic conditions which makes it rich in wheat germplasm adapted to various niches. Germplasm repository consists of local landraces, trait specific genetic stocks including introgressions from wild relatives, exotic collections, released varieties, and improved germplasm. Characterization of genetic diversity is done using morpho-physiological characters as well as by analyzing variations at DNA level. However, there are not many reports on array based high throughput SNP markers having characteristics of genome wide coverage employed in Indian spring wheat germplasm. Amongst wheat SNP arrays, 35K Axiom Wheat Breeder's Array has the highest SNP polymorphism efficiency suitable for genetic mapping and genetic diversity characterization. Therefore, genotyping was done using 35K in 483 wheat genotypes resulting in 14,650 quality filtered SNPs, that were distributed across the B (~â50%), A (~â39%), and D (~â10%) genomes. The total genetic distance coverage was 4477.85Â cM with 3.27 SNP/cM and 0.49Â cM/SNP as average marker density and average inter-marker distance, respectively. The PIC ranged from 0.09 to 0.38 with an average of 0.29 across genomes. Population structure and Principal Coordinate Analysis resulted in two subpopulations (SP1 and SP2). The analysis of molecular variance revealed the genetic variation of 2% among and 98% within subpopulations indicating high gene flow between SP1 and SP2. The subpopulation SP2 showed high level of genetic diversity based on genetic diversity indices viz.

In this view, two contrasting genotypes, namely, NI5439 41 (drought tolerant) and WL711 (drought susceptible) were used to generate ~78.2 GB data for the responses of wheat roots to drought. A total of 45139 DEGs, 13820 TF, 288 miRNAs, 640 pathways and 435829 putative markers were obtained. Study reveals use of such data in QTL to QTN refinement by analysis on two model drought-responsive QTLs on chromosome 3B in wheat roots possessing 18 differentially regulated genes with 190 sequence variants (173 SNPs and 17 InDels). Gene regulatory networks showed 69 hub-genes integrating ABA dependent and independent pathways controlling sensing of drought, root growth, uptake regulation, purine metabolism, thiamine metabolism and antibiotics pathways, stomatal closure and senescence. Eleven SSR markers were validated in a panel of 18 diverse wheat varieties. For effective future use of findings, web genomic resources were developed.

"31681395","articletitle","A Co-Expression Network in Hexaploid Wheat Reveals Mostly Balanced Expression and Lack of Significant Gene Loss of Homeologous Meiotic Genes Upon Polyploidization."
"31681395","abstracttext","Polyploidization has played an important role in plant evolution. However, upon polyploidization, the process of meiosis must adapt to ensure the proper segregation of increased numbers of chromosomes to produce balanced gametes. It has been suggested that meiotic gene (MG) duplicates return to a single copy following whole genome duplication to stabilize the polyploid genome. Therefore, upon the polyploidization of wheat, a hexaploid species with three related (homeologous) genomes, the stabilization process may have involved rapid changes in content and expression of MGs on homeologous chromosomes (homeologs). To examine this hypothesis, sets of candidate MGs were identified in wheat using co-expression network analysis and orthology informed approaches. In total, 130 RNA-Seq samples from a range of tissues including wheat meiotic anthers were used to define co-expressed modules of genes. Three modules were significantly correlated with meiotic tissue samples but not with other tissue types. These modules were enriched for GO terms related to cell cycle, DNA replication, and chromatin modification and contained orthologs of known MGs. Overall, 74.4% of genes within these meiosis-related modules had three homeologous copies which was similar to other tissue-related modules. Amongst wheat MGs identified by orthology, rather than co-expression, the majority (93.7%) were either retained in hexaploid wheat at the same number of copies (78.4%) or increased in copy number (15.3%) compared to ancestral wheat species. Furthermore, genes within meiosis-related modules showed more balanced expression levels between homeologs than genes in non-meiosis-related modules. Taken together, our results do not support extensive gene loss nor changes in homeolog expression of MGs upon wheat polyploidization. The construction of the MG co-expression network allowed identification of hub genes and provided key targets for future studies."

"32689920","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) and stem rust are among the most devastating diseases of wheat worldwide. Fhb1 is the most widely utilized and the only isolated gene for FHB resistance, while Sr2 is a durable stem rust resistance gene used in rust-prone areas. The two loci are closely linked on the short arm of chromosome 3B and the two genes are in repulsion phase among cultivars. With climate change and the shift in Fusarium populations, it is imperative to develop wheat cultivars resistant to both diseases. The present study was dedicated to developing wheat germplasm combining Fhb1 and Sr2 resistance alleles in the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT)'s elite cultivars' backgrounds. Four recombinant inbred lines (RILs) in Hartog background that have the resistant Fhb1 and Sr2 alleles in coupled phase linkage were crossed with seven CIMMYT bread wheat lines, resulting in 208 lines. Molecular markers for both genes were employed in addition to the use of pseudo-black chaff (PBC) as a phenotypic marker for the selection of Sr2 . At various stages of the selection process, progeny lines were assessed for FHB index, Fusarium damaged kernels (FDK), stem rust, and PBC expression as well as other diseases of interest (stripe rust and leaf spotting diseases). The 25 best lines were selected for CIMMYT's wheat breeding program. In addition to expressing resistance to FHB, most of these 25 lines have an acceptable level of resistance to other tested diseases. These lines will be useful for wheat breeding programs worldwide and potentially speed up the resistance breeding efforts against FHB and stem rust."

They are derived by backcrossing wheat onto hybrids between wheat and either Thinopyrum intermedium (6x) or Th. ponticum (10x). GISH analysis has shown that, with possibly one exception, the alien genomes (chromosome sets) in partial amphiploids are found to be hybrids i.e. composed of chromosomes from more than one alien genome. The individual partial amphiploids are meiotically stable and nearly perfectly fertile, but hybrids between different lines were characterized by varying numbers of unpaired chromosomes and consequently variable degrees of sterility. Translocated chromosomes involving different Thinopyrum genomes or Thinopyrum and wheat genomes were found in partial amphiploids and consequently in the addition lines derived from them. Partial amphiploids have proven to be an excellent tertiary gene pool for wheat improvement, containing resistance to biotic stresses not present in wheat itself. Resistance to Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus (BYDV) and Wheat Streak Mosaic Virus (WSMV) have been found in partial amphiploids and addition lines derived from both Th. intermedium and Th. ponticum. Excellent resistance to Fusarium head blight has been found on a Th. intermedium chromosome that had substituted for chromosome 2D in wheat. Genes for resistance to leaf rust and stem rust have already been incorporated into wheat and tagged with molecular markers."

The current study is to investigate changes of anti-oxidative physiological indices of 10 wheat genotypes at tillering stage. The main results and conclusion of tillering stage in terms of activities of POD, SOD, CAT and MDA content as followed: (1) 10 wheat genotypes can be generally grouped into three kinds (A-C, respectively) according to their changing trend of the measured indices; (2) A group performed better drought resistance under the condition of treatment level 1 (appropriate level), whose activities of anti-oxidative enzymes (POD, SOD, CAT) were higher and MDA lower; (3) B group exhibited stronger anti-drought under treatment level 2 (light-stress level), whose activities of anti-oxidative enzymes were higher and MDA lower; (4) C group expressed anti-drought to some extent under treatment level 3 (serious-stress), whose activities of anti-oxidative enzymes were stronger, MDA lower; (5) these results demonstrated that different wheat genotypes have different physiological mechanisms to adapt themselves to changing drought stress, whose molecular basis is discrete gene expression profiling (transcriptom). The study in this respect is the key to wheat anti-drought and biological-saving water in worldwide arid and semi-arid areas; (6) POD, SOD, and CAT activities and MDA content of different wheat genotypes had quite different changing trend at different stages and under different soil water stress conditions, which was linked with their origin of cultivation and individual soil water threshold, which will provide better reference to selecting proper plant species for eco-environmental construction and crops for sustainable agriculture in arid and semi-arid areas."

To solve this problem, we develop a specialized bioinformatics workflow that optimizes transcriptome assembly and separation of merged homoeologs. To evaluate our strategy, we sequence and assemble the transcriptome of one of the diploid ancestors of pasta wheat, and compare both assemblies with a benchmark set of 13,472 full-length, non-redundant bread wheat cDNAs."
"23800085","abstracttext_results","A total of 489 million 100 bp paired-end reads from tetraploid wheat assemble in 140,118 contigs, including 96% of the benchmark cDNAs. We used a comparative genomics approach to annotate 66,633 open reading frames. The multiple k-mer assembly strategy increases the proportion of cDNAs assembled full-length in a single contig by 22% relative to the best single k-mer size. Homoeologs are separated using a post-assembly pipeline that includes polymorphism identification, phasing of SNPs, read sorting, and re-assembly of phased reads. Using a reference set of genes, we determine that 98.7% of SNPs analyzed are correctly separated by phasing."
"23800085","abstracttext_conclusions","Our study shows that de novo transcriptome assembly of tetraploid wheat benefit from multiple k-mer assembly strategies more than diploid wheat. Our results also demonstrate that phasing approaches originally designed for heterozygous diploid organisms can be used to separate the close homoeologous genomes of tetraploid wheat. The predicted tetraploid wheat proteome and gene models provide a valuable tool for the wheat research community and for those interested in comparative genomic studies."
"24098671","articletitle","Haplotype variation of Glu-D1 locus and the origin of Glu-D1d allele conferring superior end-use qualities in common wheat."
"24098671","abstracttext","In higher plants, seed storage proteins (SSPs) are frequently expressed from complex gene families, and allelic variation of SSP genes often affects the quality traits of crops. In common wheat, the Glu-D1 locus, encoding 1Dx and 1Dy SSPs, has multiple alleles. The Glu-D1d allele frequently confers superior end-use qualities to commercial wheat varieties. Here, we studied the haplotype structure of Glu-D1 genomic region and the origin of Glu-D1d. Using seven diagnostic DNA markers, 12 Glu-D1 haplotypes were detected among common wheat, European spelt wheat (T. spelta, a primitive hexaploid relative of common wheat), and Aegilops tauschii (the D genome donor of hexaploid wheat). By comparatively analyzing Glu-D1 haplotypes and their associated 1Dx and 1Dy genes, we deduce that the haplotype carrying Glu-D1d was likely differentiated in the ancestral hexaploid wheat around 10,000 years ago, and was subsequently transmitted to domesticated common wheat and T. spelta. A group of relatively ancient Glu-D1 haplotypes was discovered in Ae. tauschii, which may serve for the evolution of other haplotypes. Moreover, a number of new Glu-D1d variants were found in T. spelta. The main steps in Glu-D1d differentiation are proposed. The implications of our work for enhancing the utility of Glu-D1d in wheat quality improvement and studying the SSP alleles in other crop species are discussed."

"27695475","abstracttext","Soil salinity is a serious problem worldwide that reduces agricultural productivity. Trichoderma longibrachiatum T6 (T6) has been shown to promote wheat growth and induce plant resistance to parasitic nematodes, but whether the plant-growth-promoting fungi T6 can enhance plant tolerance to salt stress is unknown. Here, we determined the effect of plant-growth-promoting fungi T6 on wheat seedlings' growth and development under salt stress, and investigated the role of T6 in inducing the resistance to NaCl stress at physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels. Wheat seedlings were inoculated with the strain of T6 and then compared with non-inoculated controls. Shoot height, root length, and shoot and root weights were measured on 15 days old wheat seedlings grown either under 150 mM NaCl or in a controlled setting without any NaCl. A number of colonies were re-isolated from the roots of wheat seedlings under salt stress. The relative water content in the leaves and roots, chlorophyll content, and root activity were significantly increased, and the accumulation of proline content in leaves was markedly accelerated with the plant growth parameters, but the content of leaf malondialdehyde under saline condition was significantly decreased. The antioxidant enzymes-superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) in wheat seedlings were increased by 29, 39, and 19%, respectively, with the application of the strain of T6 under salt stress; the relative expression of SOD, POD, and CAT genes in these wheat seedlings were significantly up-regulated. Our results indicated that the strain of T6 ameliorated the adverse effects significantly, protecting the seedlings from salt stress during their growth period. The possible mechanisms by which T6 suppresses the negative effect of NaCl stress on wheat seedling growth may be due to the improvement of the antioxidative defense system and gene expression in the stressed wheat plants."

"29633082","abstracttext","Wheat dwarf disease caused by wheat dwarf virus (WDV) is currently present in wheat growing regions in China and causes serious losses in wheat yield. To develop reliable and effective serological detection methods for WDV, the coat protein (CP) gene of WDV was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant CP protein was immunized to BALB/c mice, and four hybridoma cell lines (i.e. 18G10, 9G4, 23F4 and 22A10) secreting anti-WDV monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were obtained through the hybridoma technique. Using the prepared MAbs, an antigen-coated-plate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ACP-ELISA) and a dot-ELISA were established for detecting WDV in wheat samples. The most sensitive ACP-ELISA based on MAb 23F4 or 22A10 was able to detect WDV in 1:163,840 (w/v, g/mL) diluted WDV-infected wheat plant crude extracts. The dot-ELISA based on MAb 23F4 was the most sensitive and able to detect the virus in 1:5,120 (w/v, g/mL) diluted wheat plant crude extracts. A total of 128 wheat samples were collected from wheat growing regions in the Shaanxi and Qinghai provinces, China, and were screened for the presence of WDV using two developed serological assays. Results from the survey showed that approximately 62% of the samples were infected with WDV. PCR followed by DNA sequencing and sequence alignment validated the results from the two serological assays. Therefore, we consider that these two serological detection methods can be significantly useful for the control of WDV in China."

"31156603","abstracttext","While the wheat-associated microbiome is of major agricultural importance, little is known about the alterations in wheat grain microbial community composition during storage. Characterization of the bacterial and fungal communities in stored wheat grains revealed the impact of phosphine fumigation, one of the most effective methods to eliminate insects in stored commodities, on the composition of the wheat grain microbiome. High-throughput amplicon sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was used to analyze the wheat grain microbiome at different times over as 6 months period of storage. Higher bacterial diversity was found across the samples during the first (immediately after harvest) and second (3 months later) time points, with a predominance of Proteobacteria , Firmicutes , Actinobacteria , Bacteroidetes and Planctomycetes . A two-fold decrease in the number of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was observed in wheat grains at the last time point (6 months later), following phosphine treatment. In contrast to the effect of phosphine on bacteria, it did not affect fungal diversity in stored grains. The majority of fungal sequences were assigned to Ascomycota , followed by Basidiomycota , Glomeromycota , and unidentified fungi, which were evenly distributed throughout the storage period. Alpha and beta diversity analyses were confirmed by examination of the cultured microbial taxa obtained from the stored wheat grains. Mycotoxin analysis of wheat grains collected after phosphine fumigation revealed the presence of Fusarium toxins, primarily deoxynivalenol (DON). Several mycotoxigenic Fusarium spp. were also detected in the same samples. Results of the present study indicate that microbiome of stored, whole wheat grains was strongly affected by phosphine fumigation, which changed the structure of the microbial community leading to shifts in species composition toward mycotoxigenic strains. A better understanding of the complex interactions within the microbial communities of stored grains will assist in the development of novel biocontrol strategies to overcome mycotoxin contamination."

"30109393","abstracttext_key message","We physically dissected and mapped wheat chromosome 2B and its homoeologues in Aegilops speltoides and Thinopyrum elongatum based on meiotic homoeologous recombination, providing a unique physical framework for genome studies. Common wheat has a large and complex genome with narrow genetic diversity and various degrees of recombination between the A, B, and D subgenomes. This has limited the homologous recombination-based genome studies in wheat. Here, we exploited meiotic homoeologous recombination for molecular mapping of wheat chromosome 2B and its homoeologue 2S from Aegilops speltoides and 2E from Thinopyrum elongatum. The 2B-2S and 2B-2E recombination was induced by the ph1b mutant, and recovered using molecular markers and fluorescent genomic in situ hybridization (FGISH). A total of 112 2B-2S and 87 2B-2E recombinants involving different chromosome regions were developed and physically delineated by FGISH. The 2B-2S and 2B-2E recombination hotspots mapped to the subterminal regions on both arms. Recombination hotspots with the highest recombination rates mapped to the short arms. Eighty-three 2B-2S and 67 2B-2E recombinants were genotyped using the wheat 90Â K SNP arrays. Based on the genotyping results and FGISH patterns of the recombinants, chromosomes 2B, 2S, and 2E were partitioned into 93, 66, and 46 bins, respectively. In total, 1037 SNPs physically mapped onto distinct bins of these three homoeologous chromosomes. A homoeologous recombination-based bin map was constructed for chromosome 2B, providing a unique physical framework for genome studies in wheat and its relatives. Meiotic homoeologous recombination also facilitates gene introgression to diversify the wheat genome for germplasm development. Therefore, homoeologous recombination-based studies enhance understanding of the wheat genome and its homoeologous counterparts from wild grasses, and expand the genetic variability of the wheat genome."

Single uredinial isolates (757 in total) were derived from the collections and tested for virulence phenotype on lines of Thatcher wheat that are near-isogenic for leaf rust resistance genes Lr1, Lr2a, Lr2c, Lr3a, Lr9, Lr16, Lr24, Lr26, Lr3ka, Lr11, Lr17a, Lr30, LrB, Lr10, Lr14a, Lr18, Lr21, and Lr28, and winter wheat lines with genes Lr41 and Lr42. In the United States in 2004, 52 virulence phenotypes of P. triticina were found. Virulence phenotype MCDSB, selected by virulence to resistance genes Lr17a and Lr26, was the most common phenotype in the United States and was found in all wheat growing areas. Virulence phenotype TBBGG, with virulence to Lr2a, was the second most common phenotype and was found primarily in the spring wheat region of the north-central states. Virulence phenotype MBDSB, which has virulence to Lr17a, was the third most common phenotype and was found in all wheat growing areas except California. Phenotype TNRJJ, with virulence to genes Lr9, Lr24, and Lr41, was the fourth most common phenotype and occurred in the southeastern states and throughout the Great Plains region. Virulence phenotypes avirulent to a second gene in the Thatcher differential line with Lr1 increased in frequency in the United States in 2004. The highly diverse population of P. triticina in the United States will continue to present a challenge for the development of wheat cultivars with effective durable resistance."

"31824519","abstracttext","The improvement of grain filling is the key issue for promoting wheat thousand grain weight and grain yield. The levels of polyamines (PAs) significantly affect grain filling in cereals, but the mechanism by which PAs affect grain filling in wheat is unclear. In the present study, six wheat cultivars whose grain filling differed were used, and their grain-filling characteristics and endogenous PA contents were measured. In addition, exogenous PAs were supplied during the wheat grain-filling period. The grain-filling characteristics, hormone levels, starch contents, and gene expression [based on RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)] in the grain were analyzed. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of PAs on grain filling in wheat. The results suggested that the direct synthetic pathway from putrescine (Put) to spermidine (Spd) in the grain was a key factor in promoting grain filling and thousand grain weight in wheat. Spd through regulates the grain-filling rate of inferior grain during the early grain-filling period to affecting the grain filling and thousand grain weight of wheat. The promotive effect of Spd on the grain filling of inferior wheat grain was notably related to carbohydrate metabolism in that grain. Spd significantly increased the zeatin (Z) + zeatin riboside (ZR) contents but reduced the ethylene (ETH) evolution rate in the inferior grain. In addition, Spd significantly increased the sucrose synthase (SS) and acid invertase (AI) activities in the inferior grain. These effects of Spd led to increased sucrose content in the inferior grain. These reasons might explain why Spd significantly promoted the filling and weight of inferior wheat grain."

"31183521","abstracttext_key message","We identified, mapped and introduced novel Aegilops speltoides-derived resistance genes for tan spot and SNB diseases into wheat, enhancing understanding and utilization of host resistance to both diseases in wheat. Tan spot and Septoria nodorum blotch (SNB) are two important fungal diseases of wheat. Resistance to these diseases is often observed as the lack of sensitivity to the necrotrophic effectors (NE) produced by the fungal pathogens and thus exhibits a recessive inheritance pattern. In this study, we identified novel genes for resistance to tan spot and SNB on Aegilops speltoides (2nâ=â2xâ=â14, genome SS) chromosome 2S. These genes confer dominant resistance in the wheat background, indicating a distinct NE-independent mechanism of resistance. Ae. speltoides chromosome 2S was engineered for resistance gene introgression and molecular mapping by inducing meiotic homoeologous recombination with wheat chromosome 2B. Twenty representative 2B-2S recombinants were evaluated for reaction to tan spot and SNB and were delineated by genomic in situ hybridization and high-throughput wheat 90Â K SNP assay. The resistance genes physically mapped to the sub-telomeric region (~â8Â Mb) on the short arm of chromosome 2S and designated TsrAes1 for tan spot resistance and SnbAes1 for SNB resistance. In addition, we developed SNP-derived PCR markers closely linked to TsrAes1/SnbAes1 for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding. TsrAes1 and SnbAes1 are the first set of NE-independent tan spot, and SNB resistance genes are identified from Ae. speltoides. The 2SS-2BSÂ·2BL recombinants with minimal amounts of Ae. speltoides chromatin containing TsrAes1/SnbAes1 were produced for germplasm development, making the wild species-derived resistance genes usable in wheat breeding. This will strengthen and diversify resistance of wheat to tan spot and SNB and facilitate understanding of resistance to these two diseases."

The breakthrough of sequencing the bread wheat genome and progenitor genomes lays the foundation to decipher the complexity of wheat origin and evolutionary process as well as the genetic consequences of polyploidization. In this study, we sequenced 3286 BACs from chromosome 7DL of bread wheat cv. Chinese Spring and integrated the unmapped contigs from IWGSC v1 and available PacBio sequences to close gaps present in the 7DL assembly. In total, 8043 out of 12Â 825 gaps, representing 3Â 491Â 264Â bp, were closed. We then used the improved assembly of 7DL to perform comparative genomic analysis of bread wheat (Ta7DL) and its D donor, Aegilops tauschii (At7DL), to identify domestication signatures. Results showed a strong syntenic relationship between Ta7DL and At7DL, although some small rearrangements were detected at the distal regions. A total of 53 genes appear to be lost genes during wheat polyploidization, with 23% (12 genes) as RGA (disease resistance gene analogue). Furthermore, 86 positively selected genes (PSGs) were identified, considered to be domestication-related candidates. Finally, overlapping of QTLs obtained from GWAS analysis and PSGs indicated that TraesCS7D02G321000 may be one of the domestication genes involved in grain morphology. This study provides comparative information on the sequence, structure and organization between bread wheat and Ae.Â tauschii from the perspective of the 7DL chromosome, which contribute to better understanding of the evolution of wheat, and supports wheat crop improvement."

A total of 2885 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were revealed from the sequencing, and they mainly distributed in the phylum of Proteobacteria. Twenty-nine OTUs formed the core microbiota of wheat plants. The differences between above- and below-ground environments could explain most of the dissimilarity of wheat-associated microbial communities.

"31644391","abstracttext","Rye ( Secale cereale L.) is an important gene donor for wheat improvement because of its many valuable traits, especially disease resistance. Development of novel wheat-rye translocations with disease resistance can contribute to transferring resistance into common wheat. In a previous study, a wheat-rye T4BLÂ·4RL and T7ASÂ·4RS translocation line (WR41-1) was developed by distant hybridization, and it was speculated that its resistance to powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici ( Bgt ), was derived from rye based on pedigree analysis. To make accurate use of chromosome 4R in wheat improvement, a set of new 4R translocations involving different arm translocations (e.g., 4RS monosomic, 4RL monosomic, 4RL disomic, 4RS monosomic plus 4RL monosomic, 4RS monosomic plus 4RL disomic, and 4RS disomic plus 4RL disomic translocations) was developed from crosses with common wheat. Those translocations were characterized by genomic in situ hybridization and expressed sequence tag simple sequence repeat marker analysis. To confirm the source of powdery mildew resistance, the translocation plants were tested against Bgt isolate E09. The results indicated that all translocations with 4RL were resistant at all tested growth stages, whereas those with only 4RS translocation or no alien translocation were susceptible. This further indicated that the powdery mildew resistance of WR41-1 was derived from the alien chromosome arm 4RL. To effectively use 4RL resistance in wheat improvement, two competitive allele-specific PCR markers specific for chromosome arm 4RL were developed to detect the alien chromosome in the wheat genome. These new translocation lines with diagnostic markers can efficiently serve as important bridges for wheat improvement."

"19175520","abstracttext","Advances in the genetic transformation of cereals have improved the prospects of using biotechnology for plant improvement, and a toolbox of promoters with defined specificities would be a valuable resource in controlling the expression of transgenes in desired tissues for both plant improvement and molecular farming. A number of promoters have been isolated from the important cereals (wheat, barley, rice and maize), and these promoters have been tested mostly in homologous cereal systems and, to a lesser extent, in heterologous cereal systems. The use of these promoters across the important cereals would add value to the utility of each promoter. In addition, promoters with less sequence homology, but with similar specificities, will be crucial in avoiding homology-based gene silencing when expressing more than one transgene in the same tissue. We have tested wheat and barley promoters in transgenic barley and wheat to determine whether their specificity is shared across these two species. The barley bifunctional alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitor (Isa) promoter, specific to the pericarp in barley, failed to show any activity in wheat, whereas the wheat early-maturing (Em) promoter showed similar activity in wheat and barley. The wheat high-molecular-weight glutenin (HMW-Glu) and barley D-hordein (D-Hor) and B-hordein (B-Hor) storage protein promoters maintained endosperm-specific expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in wheat and barley, respectively. Using gfp, we have demonstrated that the Isa and Em promoters can be used as strong promoters to direct transgenes in specific tissues of barley and wheat grain. Differential promoter activity across cereals expands and adds value to a promoter toolbox for utility in plant biotechnology."

"12647062","abstracttext","Leaf rust is the most common disease in wheat production. There are more than 45 specific resistance genes described and used in wheat breeding to control epidemics of leaf rust, but none of them has been cloned. The leaf rust disease resistance gene 1 ( Lr1) is a good model gene for isolation by map-based cloning because it is a single, dominant gene which is located in the distal region of chromosome 5DL of wheat. As the first step towards the isolation of this gene we constructed a high-resolution genetic map in the region of the Lr1 locus by saturation mapping of two large segregating F(2) populations (Thatcher Lr1 x Thatcher, Thatcher Lr1 x Frisal). The resistance gene Lr1 was delimited in a 0.16-cM region between the RFLP markers ABC718 and PSR567 (0.12 cM from ABC718 and 0.04 cM from PSR567). A genomic BAC library of Aegilops tauschii (D genome) was screened using the RFLP markers ABC718 and PSR567. Five positive BAC clones were identified by ABC718 and four clones by PSR567. Two NBS-LRR type of resistance gene analogs, which encode proteins highly homologous to the bacterial blight disease resistance protein Xa1 of rice, were identified on BAC clones isolated with PSR567. Polymorphic BAC end probes were isolated from both ends of a 105-kb large BAC clone identified by ABC718. The end probes were mapped at the same locus as ABC718, and no recombination event was found within 105 kb around ABC718 in our analysis of more than 4,000 gametes."

"16172531","abstracttext","The cold acclimation process in plants is primarily regulated through the signal transduction pathways that lead to the induction and enhancement of expression of different sets of Cor/Lea genes. Winter wheat 'Mironovskaya 808' (M808) exhibited a much higher level of freezing tolerance than spring wheat 'Chinese Spring' (CS), and the difference became clearer after the long-term cold acclimation. To understand the molecular basis of this cultivar difference, we isolated two CBF/DREB1 homologs, Wcbf2, which are the candidate gene for a transcription factor of the Cor/Lea genes. Expression of the Wcbf2 gene was induced rapidly by low temperature (LT) and drought but not by abscisic acid (ABA). The gene expression was temporal and at least twice up-regulated by LT. The first up-regulation occurred within 1-4 h, which might correspond to the rapid response to LT, while the second up-regulation occurred during 2-3 weeks of cold acclimation. After the second up-regulation, the amount of Wcbf2 transcript greatly decreased in CS, while it increased again in M808 after 4 weeks until 9 weeks (end of the test period). The maintenance of this high level of the Wcbf2 transcript might represent the long-term effect of cold acclimation. The activation of Cor/Lea genes followed the accumulation of Wcbf2 transcript suggested direct involvement of the Wcbf2 gene in the induction and enhancement of the Cor/Lea gene expression. The cultivar difference in freezing tolerance developed during different stages of cold acclimation can be at least partly explained by the differential and coordinated regulation of the predicted Cor/Lea gene signal transduction pathway that is mediated by the CBF/DREB1 transcription factors in common wheat."

"16406750","abstracttext","Although triose phosphate/phosphate translocator is known to play an important role in regulating the distribution of assimilates in wheat chloroplasts, the mechanism of triose phosphate/phosphate translocator gene control has not yet been clearly elucidated. We first showed that glucose inhibited the expression of triose phosphate/phosphate translocator gene in wheat by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. The triose phosphate/phosphate translocator expression was seriously impaired by 5 mmol/L glucose, and it responded slowly, more than 48 h, to level as low as 1 mmol/L glucose. Both glucose and 2-deoxyglucose inhibited the expression of triose phosphate/phosphate translocator gene, but 2-deoxyglucose-6-P, product of phosphorylated 2-deoxyglucose, cannot be further metabolized, therefore the further metabolism of phosphorylated glucose by hexokinase is not a prerequisite for triggering glucose-regulated expression of triose phosphate/phosphate translocator gene. Glucose had little inhibitory effect on the expression of triose phosphate/phosphate translocator gene when hexokinase activity was reduced or eliminated by transforming wheat protoplasts with a hexokinase antisense construct or treating protoplasts with glucosamine, an inhibitor of hexokinase. Therefore, it appears essential for hexokinase to retain phosphorylation activity for glucose to regulate the expression of triose phosphate/phosphate translocator gene. The treatment of protoplasts with glucose-6-phosphate resulting in no inhibition of triose phosphate/phosphate translocator expression demonstrated that phosphorylation via hexokinase is necessary for glucose inhibiting triose phosphate/phosphate translocator expression. All the data suggest that triose phosphate/phosphate translocator is regulated by glucose via a hexokinase-dependent pathway."

"18595724","abstracttext","Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are members of the family of pathogenesis-related proteins (PR-14) that are believed to be involved in plant defense responses. In this study, a novel gene Ltp 3F1 encoding an antifungal protein from wheat (Sumai 3) was subcloned, overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL-21 (DE3) and enriched using ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by gel permeation chromatography. Molecular phylogeny analyses of wheat Ltp 3F1 gene showed a strong identity to other plant LTPs. Predicted three-dimensional structural model showed the presence of 6 alpha-helices and 9 loop turns. The active site catalytic residues Gly30, Pro50, Ala52 and Cys55 may be suggested for catalyzing the reaction involved in lipid binding. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed the production of recombinant fusion protein. The LTP fusion protein exhibited a broad-spectrum antifungal activity against Alternaria sp., Rhizoctonia solani, Curvularia lunata, Bipolaris oryzae, Cylindrocladium scoparium, Botrytis cinerea and Sarocladium oryzae. Gene cassette with cyanamide hydratase (cah) marker and Ltp 3F1 gene was constructed for genetic transformation in tobacco. Efficient regeneration was achieved in selective media amended with cyanamide. Transgenic plants with normal phenotype were obtained. Results of PCR and Southern, Northern and Western hybridization analyses confirmed the integration and expression of genes in transgenic plants. Experiments with detached leaves from transgenic tobacco expressing Ltp 3F1 gene showed fungal resistance. Due to the innate potential of broad-spectrum antifungal activity, wheat Ltp 3F1 gene can be used to enhance resistance against fungi in crop plants."

The race TTKSK (Ug99) of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, the causal pathogen for wheat stem rust, is considered as a major threat to global wheat production. To address this threat, researchers across the world have been devoted to identifying TTKSK-resistant genes. Here, we report the identification and mapping of a stem rust resistance gene in Aegilops tauschii accession CIae 25 that confers resistance to TTKSK and the development of molecular markers for the gene. An F2 population of 710 plants from an Ae. tauschii cross CIae 25 Ã AL8/78 were first evaluated against race TPMKC. A set of 14 resistant and 116 susceptible F2:3 families from the F2 plants were then evaluated for their reactions to TTKSK. Based on the tests, 179 homozygous susceptible F2 plants were selected as the mapping population to identify the simple sequence repeat (SSR) and sequence tagged site (STS) markers linked to the gene by bulk segregant analysis. A dominant stem rust resistance gene was identified and mapped with 16 SSR and five new STS markers to the deletion bin 2DS5-0.47-1.00 of chromosome arm 2DS in which Sr46 was located. Molecular marker and stem rust tests on CIae 25 and two Ae. tauschii accessions carrying Sr46 confirmed that the gene in CIae 25 is Sr46. This study also demonstrated that Sr46 is temperature-sensitive being less effective at low temperatures. The marker validation indicated that two closely linked markers Xgwm210 and Xwmc111 can be used for marker-assisted selection of Sr46 in wheat breeding programs."

"32355504","abstracttext_background","Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is one of the most common and accurate methods of gene expression analysis. However, the biggest challenge for this kind of examinations is normalization of the results, which requires the application of dependable internal controls. The selection of appropriate reference genes (RGs) is one of the most crucial points in qPCR data analysis and for correct assessment of gene expression. Because of the fact that many reports indicate that the expression profiles of typically used RGs can be unstable in certain experimental conditions, species or tissues, reference genes with stable expression levels should be selected individually for each experiment. In this study, we analysed a set of ten candidate RGs for wheat seedlings under short-term drought stress. Our tests included five 'traditional' RGs (GAPDH, ACT, UBI, TUB, and TEF1) and five novel genes developed by the RefGenes tool from the Genevestigator database."
"32355504","abstracttext_results","Expression stability was assessed using five different algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, RefFinder and the delta Ct method. In the final ranking, we identified three genes: CJ705892, ACT, and UBI, as the best candidates for housekeeping genes. However, our data indicated a slight variation between the different algorithms that were used. We revealed that the novel gene CJ705892, obtained by means of in silico analysis, showed the most stable expression in the experimental tissue and condition."
"32355504","abstracttext_conclusions","Our results support the statement, that novel genes selected for certain experimental conditions have a more stable level of expression in comparison to routinely applied RGs, like genes encoding actin, tubulin or GAPDH. Selected CJ705892 gene can be used as a housekeeping gene in the expression analysis in wheat seedlings under short-term drought. The results of our study will be useful for subsequent analyses of gene expression in wheat tissues subjected to drought."
"30723619","articletitle","Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of new cytokinin metabolic genes in bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.)."
"30723619","abstracttext","Cytokinins (CKs) are involved in determining the final grain yield in wheat. Multiple gene families are responsible for the controlled production of CKs in plants, including isopentenyl transferases for de novo synthesis, zeatin O-glucosyltransferases for reversible inactivation, Î²-glucosidases for reactivation, and CK oxidases/dehydrogenases for permanent degradation. Identifying and characterizing the genes of these families is an important step in furthering our understanding of CK metabolism. Using bioinformatics tools, we identified four new TaIPT , four new TaZOG , and 25 new TaGLU genes in common wheat. All of the genes harbored the characteristic conserved domains of their respective gene families. We renamed TaCKX genes on the basis of their true orthologs in rice and maize to remove inconsistencies in the nomenclature. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the early divergence of monocots from dicots, and the gene duplication event after speciation was obvious. Abscisic acid-, auxin-, salicylic acid-, sulfur-, drought- and light-responsive cis -regulatory elements were common to most of the genes under investigation. Expression profiling of CK metabolic gene families was carried out at the seedlings stage in AA genome donor of common wheat. Exogenous application of phytohormones (6-benzylaminopurine, salicylic acid, indole-3-acetic acid, gibberellic acid, and abscisic acid) for 3 h significantly upregulated the transcript levels of all four gene families, suggesting that plants tend to maintain CK stability. A 6-benzylaminopurine-specific maximum fold-change was observed for TuCKX1 and TuCKX3 in root and shoot tissues, respectively; however, the highest expression level was observed in the TuGLU gene family, indicating that the reactivation of the dormant CK isoform is the quickest way to counter external stress. The identification of new CK metabolic genes provides the foundation for their in-depth functional characterization and for elucidating their association with grain yield."

"31710598","abstracttext","Powdery mildew is one of the most widespread diseases of wheat. The development and deployment of resistant varieties are one of the most economical and effective methods to manage this disease. Our previous study showed that the gene(s) at 2Mb in Chinese Spring (CS)-Aegilops biuncialis 2Mb disomic addition line TA7733 conferred a high level of resistance to powdery mildew of wheat. In this study, resistance spectrum of TA7733 was assayed by using 15 Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) isolates prevalent in different regions of China. The result indicated that TA7733 was highly resistant to all tested Bgt isolates and the gene(s) on chromosome 2Mb conferred broad-spectrum resistance to powdery mildew. In order to characterize mechanism of powdery mildew resistance by identifying candidates R-genes derived from Ae. biuncialis chromosome 2Mb and develop 2Mb-specific molecular markers, we performed RNA-seq analysis on TA7733 and CS. In total we identified 7,278 unigenes that showed specific expression in TA7733 pre and post Bgt-infection when compared to CS. Of these 7,278 unigenes, 295 were annotated as putative resistance (R) genes. Comparatively analysis of R-gene sequences from TA7733 and CS and integration CS Ref Seq v1.0 were used to develop R-gene specific primers. Of 295 R-genes we identified 53 R-genes were specific to 2Mb and could be involved in powdery mildew resistance. Functional annotation of majority of the 53 R-genes encoded nucleotide binding leucine rich repeat (NLR) protein. The broad-spectrum resistance to powdery mildew in TA7733 and availability of 2Mb-derived putative candidate R-gene specific molecular markers identified in this study will lay foundations for transferring powdery mildew resistance from 2Mb to common wheat by inducing CS-Ae. biuncialis homoeologous recombination. Our study also provides useful candidates for further isolation and cloning of powdery mildew resistance gene(s) from Ae. biuncialis chromosome 2Mb."

"31280341","abstracttext_key message","The leaf rust resistance gene Lr64 in the Thatcher wheat RL6149 was mapped to chromosome 6AL with SNP and KASP markers and a second leaf rust resistance gene was mapped to chromosome 1DS. RL6149, a near-isogenic line of Thatcher wheat, carries leaf rust resistance gene Lr64 on chromosome arm 6AL. The objective of this study was to develop molecular markers that can be easily used to select wheat lines with Lr64. RL6149 was crossed with Thatcher and F 2 plants derived from a single F 1 plant were advanced to F 6 lines by single seed descent. The 100 F 7 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) were inoculated with two races of P.triticina that differed widely for virulence in order to identify resistant and susceptible RIL. Thirty RIL that differed for resistance and the parental lines were genotyped with the 90Â K Infinium iSelect single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array to find closely linked markers with Lr64. Seven linked SNPs on chromosome arm 6AL were converted into Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) markers that were genotyped on the 100 RIL. A genetic linkage map for the seven KASP markers spanned 19.1Â cM on chromosome arm 6AL. KASP marker K-IWB59855 was tightly linked to Lr64. A second unexpected gene for leaf rust resistance also segregated in the F 7 lines. Four KASP markers that spanned 18.6Â cM located the gene on chromosome 1DS. The KASP marker K-IWB38437 was tightly linked to the second leaf rust resistance gene."
"18289404","articletitle","Mating system and recombination affect molecular evolution in four Triticeae species."
"18289404","abstracttext","Mating systems and recombination are thought to have a deep impact on the organization and evolution of genomes. Because of the decline in effective population size and the interference between linked loci, the efficacy of selection is expected to be reduced in regions with low recombination rates and in the whole genome of self-fertilizing species. At the molecular level, relaxed selection is expected to result in changes in the rate of protein evolution and the pattern of codon bias. It is increasingly recognized that recombination also affects non-selective processes such as the biased gene conversion towards GC alleles (bGC). Like selection, this kind of meiotic drive in favour of GC over AT alleles is expected to be reduced in weakly recombining regions and genomes. Here, we investigated the effect of mating system and recombination on molecular evolution in four Triticeae species: two outcrossers (Secale cereale and Aegilops speltoides) and two selfers (Triticum urartu and Triticum monococcum). We found that GC content, possibly driven by bGC, is affected by mating system and recombination as theoretically predicted. Selection efficacy, however, is only weakly affected by mating system and recombination. We investigated the possible reasons for this discrepancy. A surprising one is that, in outcrossing lineages, selection efficacy could be reduced because of high substitution rates in favour of GC alleles. Outcrossers, but not selfers, would thus suffer from a 'GC-induced' genetic load. This result sheds new light on the evolution of mating systems."
"23456845","articletitle","Cloning, expression, and evolutionary analysis of Î±-gliadin genes from Triticum and Aegilops genomes."
"23456845","abstracttext","Fifteen novel Î±-gliadin genes were cloned and sequenced from Triticum and related Aegilops genomes by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR). Sequence comparison displayed high diversities in the Î±-gliadin gene family. Four toxic epitopes and glutamine residues in the two polyglutamine domains facilitated these Î±-gliadins to be assigned to specific chromosomes. Five representative Î±-gliadin genes were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli, and their amount reached a maximum after 4 h induced by isopropyl-Î²-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG), indicating a high level of expression under the control of T7 promoter. The transcriptional expression of Î±-gliadin genes during grain development detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) showed a similar up-down regulation pattern in different genotypes. A neighbor-joining tree constructed with both full-open reading frame (ORF) Î±-gliadin genes and pseudogenes further revealed the origin and phylogenetic relationships among Triticum and related Aegilops genomes. The evolutionary analysis demonstrated that Î±-gliadin genes evolved mainly by synonymous substitutions under strong purifying selection during the evolutionary process."

"32766735","abstracttext_background and aims","The brittle rachis trait is a feature of many wild grasses, particularly within the Triticeae tribe. Wild Hordeum and Triticum species form a disarticulation layer above the rachis node, resulting in the production of wedge type dispersal units. In Aegilops longissima, only one or two of the nodes in the central portion of its rachis are brittle. In the Triticeae species, the formation of a disarticulation layer above the rachis node requires the co-transcription of the two dominant and complementary genes Btr1 and Btr2. This study aims to establish whether homologs of Btr1 and/or Btr2 underlie the unusual brittle rachis phenotype observed in Ae. longissima."

"19483774","abstracttext","Disease resistance (R) genes are intriguing in their evolution and diversity patterns because of their constant interactions with evolving pathogens. In this study, we demonstrate the use of resistance gene analog (RGA) markers to estimate genetic diversity among 13 populations (118 genotypes) of Triticum dicoccoides collected along a natural aridity gradient in Israel. The diversity patterns of 204 markers derived from two R-gene domains, nucleotide binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR), were compared and contrasted. Diversity patterns of NBS domain markers differed significantly from those of the LRR domain. NBS markers showed higher between-population diversity (Fst=0.58), while LRR markers showed higher within-population diversity (Fst=0.35). Gene diversity (He) values were twofold higher in the LRR domain than in the NBS domain (0.144 vs. 0.067). LRR He values were correlated with precipitation in the spring (r=0.8, p=0.01), while NBS He values showed no correlation with any ecogeographical variable. The evolutionary and applicative inferences of these findings are discussed. The current study demonstrates that RGA profiling is an excellent tool for studying diversity of R genes in natural plant populations."

"24314021","abstracttext_background","Flowering time greatly influences the adaptation of wheat cultivars to diverse environmental conditions and is mainly controlled by vernalization and photoperiod genes. In wheat cultivars from the Yellow and Huai Valleys, which represent 60%-70% of the total wheat production in China, the large-scale genotyping of wheat germplasms has not yet been performed in terms of vernalization and photoperiod response alleles, limiting the use of Chinese wheat germplasms to a certain extent."
"24314021","abstracttext_results","In this study, 173 winter wheat cultivars and 51 spring wheat cultivars from China were used to identify allelic variations of vernalization and photoperiod genes as well as copy number variations of Ppd-B1 and Vrn-A1. Two new co-dominant markers were developed in order to more precisely examine Vrn-A1b, Vrn-B1a, and Vrn-B1b. Two novel alleles at the Vrn-B3 locus were discovered and were designated Vrn-B3b and Vrn-B3c. Vrn-B3b had an 890-bp insertion in the promoter region of the recessive vrn-B3 allele, and Vrn-B3c allele had 2 deletions (a 20-bp deletion and a 4-bp deletion) in the promoter region of the dominant Vrn-B3a allele. Cultivar Hemai 26 lacked the Vrn-A1 gene. RT-PCR indicated that the 890-bp insertion in the Vrn-B3b allele significantly reduced the transcription of the Vrn-B3 gene. Cultivars Chadianhong with the Vrn-B3b allele and Hemai 26 with a Vrn-A1-null allele possessed relatively later heading and flowering times compared to those of Yanzhan 4110, which harbored recessive vrn-B3 and vrn-A1 alleles. Through identification of photoperiod genes, 2 new polymorphism combinations were found in 6 winter wheat cultivars and were designated Hapl-VII and Hapl-VIII, respectively. Distribution of the vernalization and photoperiod genes indicated that all recessive alleles at the 4 vernalization response loci, truncated ""Chinese Spring"" Ppd-B1 allele at Ppd-B1 locus and Hapl-I at the Ppd-D1 locus were predominant in Chinese winter wheat cultivars."

"18944455","articletitle","Molecular Mapping of the Stb4 Gene for Resistance to Septoria tritici Blotch in Wheat."
"18944455","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Breeding wheat for resistance is the most effective means to control Septoria tritici blotch (STB), caused by the ascomycete Mycosphaerella graminicola (anamorph Septoria tritici). At least eight genes that confer resistance to STB in wheat have been identified. Among them, the Stb4 locus from the wheat cv. Tadinia showed resistance to M. graminicola at both seedling and adult-plant stages. However, no attempt has been made to map the Stb4 locus in the wheat genome. A mapping population of 77 F10 recombinant-inbred lines (RILs) derived from a three-way cross between the resistant cv. Tadinia and the susceptible parent (Yecora Rojo x UC554) was evaluated for disease resistance and molecular mapping. The RILs were tested with Argentina isolate I 89 of M. graminicola for one greenhouse season in Brazil during 1999, with an isolate from Brazil (IPBr1) for one field season in Piracicaba (Brazil) during 2000, and with Indiana tester isolate IN95-Lafayette-1196-WW-1-4 in the greenhouse during 2000 and 2001. The ratio of resistant:susceptible RILs was 1:1 in all three tests, confirming the single-gene model for control of resistance to STB in Tadinia. However, the patterns of resistance and susceptibility were different between the Indiana isolate and those from South America. For example, the ratio of RILs resistant to both the Indiana and Argentina isolates, resistant to one but susceptible to the other, and susceptible to both isolates was approximately 1:1:1:1, indicating that Tadinia may contain at least two genes for resistance to STB. A similar pattern was observed between the Indiana and Brazil isolates. The gene identified with the Indiana tester isolate was assumed to be the same as Stb4, whereas that revealed by the South American isolates may be new. Bulked-segregant analysis was used to identify amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and microsatellite markers linked to the presumed Stb4 gene. The AFLP marker EcoRI-ACTG/MseI-CAAA5 and microsatellite Xgwm111 were closely linked to the Stb4 locus in coupling at distances of 2.1 and 0.7 centimorgans (cM), respectively. A flanking marker, AFLP EAGG/ M-CAT10, was 4 cM from Stb4. The Stb4 gene was in a potential supercluster of resistance genes near the centromere on the short arm of wheat chromosome 7D that also contained Stb5 plus five previously identified genes for resistance to Russian wheat aphid. The microsatellite marker Xgwm111 identified in this study may be useful for facilitating the transfer of Stb4 into improved cultivars of wheat."

This makes it difficult to design genome-specific primers to amplify individual genes from different genomes. Development of genome-specific primers for agronomically important genes in allopolypoid crops is very important and useful not only for the study of sequence diversity and association mapping of genes in natural populations, but also for the development of gene-based functional markers for marker-assisted breeding. Here we report on a useful approach for the development of genome-specific primers in allohexaploid wheat."
"20497560","abstracttext_findings","In the present study, three genome-specific primer sets for the waxy (Wx) genes and four genome-specific primer sets for the starch synthase II (SSII) genes were developed mainly from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and/or insertions or deletions (Indels) in introns and intron-exon junctions. The size of a single PCR product ranged from 750 bp to 1657 bp.

Five genome-specific primer sets for the Wx genes (one for Wx-7A, three for Wx-4A and one for Wx-7D) could distinguish the wild type wheat and partial waxy wheat lines. These genome-specific primer sets for the Wx and SSII genes produced amplifications in hexaploid wheat, cultivated durum wheat, and Aegilops tauschii accessions, but failed to generate amplification in the majority of wild diploid and tetraploid accessions."

The strategies used in this paper can be used to develop genome-specific primers for homoeologous genes in any allopolypoid species.

"29082810","abstracttext","Wheat powdery mildew is a disease of global importance that occurs across a wide geographic area in the United States. A virulence survey of Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, the causal agent, was conducted by sampling 36 wheat fields in 15 U.S. states in the years 2013 and 2014. Using a hierarchical sampling protocol, isolates were derived from three separated plants at each of five separated sites within each field in order to assess the spatial distribution of pathotypes. In total, 1,017 isolates from those fields were tested individually on single-gene differential cultivars containing a total of 21 powdery mildew resistance (Pm) genes. Several recently introgressed mildew resistance genes from wild wheat relatives (Pm37, Pm53, MlAG12, NCAG13, and MlUM15) exhibited complete or nearly complete resistance to all local B. graminis f. sp. tritici populations from across the sampled area. One older gene, Pm4b, also retained at least some efficacy across the sampled area. The B. graminis f. sp. tritici population sampled from Arkansas and Missouri, on the western edge of the eastern soft red winter wheat region, had virulence profiles more similar to other soft wheat mildew populations than to the geographically closer population from hard wheat fields in the Plains states of Oklahoma, Nebraska, and Kansas. The Plains population differed in that it was avirulent to several Pm genes long defeated in the soft-wheat-growing areas. Virulence complexity was greatest east of the Mississippi River, and diminished toward the west. Several recently introgressed Pm genes (Pm25, Pm34, Pm35, and NCA6) that are highly effective against mildew in the field in North Carolina were unexpectedly susceptible to eastern-U.S. B. graminis f. sp. tritici populations in detached-leaf tests. Sampled fields displayed a wide range of pathotype diversity and spatial distribution, suggesting that epidemics are caused by varying numbers of pathotypes in all regions. The research confirmed that most long-used Pm genes are defeated in the eastern United States, and the U.S. B. graminis f. sp. tritici population has different virulence profiles in the hard- and soft-wheat regions, which are likely maintained by host selection, isolation by distance, and west-to-east gene flow."

"2251259","abstracttext","Transcription factor IID (TFIID), the ""TATA binding factor,"" is thought to play a key role in the regulation of eukaryotic transcriptional initiation. We have studied the role of TFIID in the transcription of the yeast metallothionein gene, which is regulated by the copper-dependent activator protein ACE1. Both basal and induced transcription of the metallothionein gene require TFIID and a functional TATA binding site. Crude human and mouse TFIID fractions, prepared from mammalian cells, respond to stimulation by ACE1. In contrast, human and yeast TFIID proteins expressed from the cloned genes do not respond to ACE1, except in the presence of wheat germ or yeast total cell extracts. These results indicate that the cloned TFIID gene products lack a component(s) or modification(s) that is required for regulated as compared to basal transcription."

The system is physically flexible and should therefore be adaptable to different tissues and species. Transient expression of the Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase gene in immature wheat embryo scutella was obtained at a frequency of up to 3% of the treated cells in the surface layer. In tobacco SR1, we achieved many transgenic plants, and the efficiency of stable transformation with the neomycin phosphotransferase (NPTII) gene was approximately 10(-3) per exposed cell."

"4059057","abstracttext","The B-hordeins are the major group of prolamin storage proteins in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and they are encoded by a small multigene family that is expressed specifically in the developing endosperm.

Comparison of the 5'-flanking sequences of pBHR184 with those of related S-rich prolamin genes from wheat shows that several short sequences within 600 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon are strongly conserved. A sequence that is conserved at around -300 bp in the S-rich prolamins is also conserved at similar locations in genes encoding the two major classes of maize prolamin (the Z19 and Z21 zeins) and appears to be unique to prolamin genes. We discuss the possible role of this '-300 element' in the control of gene expression in the developing cereal endosperm."

This gene, together with a small family of related genes, was shown to reside on chromosome 3. The BLT4 clone has homology with genes in wheat and oats. Its expression was studied in oats and in barley doubled haploid lines segregating for spring/winter habit and for frost hardiness. These analyses show that elevated steady state levels of BLT4 mRNA are produced in shoot meristematic tissue after 3 days low positive temperature treatment. The low temperature response was found in all barley doubled haploid lines and was therefore not associated specifically with either the spring/winter habit or frost hardiness. Elevated levels of BLT4 mRNA were also seen in drought-stressed barley and it is likely that this is a gene encoding a low molecular weight protein that is responsive to dehydrative stresses, such as cold and drought."

In this report, the gene for a fifth polypeptide, which copurifies with the b6-f complex, is identified through the use of an antibody generated against a synthetic decapeptide predicted from a maize chloroplast DNA sequence. The deduced 37-amino acid sequence of the immunoreactive 4-kDa polypeptide is 100% and 86% conserved in the respective similar open reading frames encoded by Nicotiana tabacum and Marchantia chloroplast DNA. The 4-kDa polypeptide is present in both etioplasts and chloroplasts of maize and is found as well in spinach, tobacco, pea, wheat, and rice thylakoids. Similar to the other subunits of the b6-f complex, it is intrinsic to the membrane, and its hydrophilic COOH terminus is located at the stromal thylakoid surface. We propose to call the 4-kDa polypeptide ""subunit 5"" and the chloroplast gene that encodes it the petE gene."

"7867938","abstracttext","A Dictyostelium discoideum genomic library was screened using a degenerate oligodeoxyribonucleotide derived from the peptide, GPKAPT, obtained from the N terminus of purified histone H1. Two identical H1 clones were isolated. Comparative sequence data reveal a typical H1 three-domain structure with considerable homology to the globular domain of higher eukaryotic H1 histones, especially to plant H1 histones. Southern blot analysis shows that this gene is probably a single-copy gene, and suggests that any other H1 gene(s), if present, must be very different in sequence. Amino acid (aa) sequence comparison of the globular core of D. discoideum H1 to the consensus globular core reveals the absence of a 6-aa motif, GXGXXG, from D. discoideum. This motif matches the consensus for a putative nucleotide-binding loop, which is also absent in plant H1 histones like Arabidopsis thaliana, pea and wheat."

"7559324","abstracttext","Azospirillum brasilense can display a single polar flagellum and several lateral flagella. The A. brasilense Sp7 gene laf1, encoding the flagellin of the lateral flagella, was isolated and sequenced. The derived protein sequence is extensively similar to those of the flagellins of Rhizobium meliloti, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Bartonella bacilliformis, and Caulobacter crescentus. An amino acid alignment shows that the flagellins of these bacteria are clustered and are clearly different from other known flagellins. A laf1 mutant, FAJ0201, was constructed by replacing an internal part of the laf1 gene by a kanamycin resistance-encoding gene cassette. The mutant is devoid of lateral flagella but still forms the polar flagellum.

"10394948","articletitle","The S7 ribosomal protein gene is truncated and overlaps a cytochrome c biogenesis gene in pea mitochondria."
"10394948","abstracttext","The pea mitochondrial genome contains a truncated rps7 gene lacking ca. 40 codons at its 5' terminus. This single-copy sequence is immediately downstream of and slightly overlapping an actively transcribed and edited reading frame of 744 bp (designated ccb248) homologous to the bacterial helC gene which encodes a subunit of the ABC-type heme transporter involved in cytochrome c biogenesis. This region of mitochondrial DNA appears recombinogenic, and the carboxy-termini of helC-type proteins are predicted to vary in sequence and length among plants. Sequences corresponding to the 5' coding region of rps7 were not detected elsewhere in the pea mitochondrial genome using wheat rps7 probes, and only a very short internal rps7 segment was observed in soybean mitochondrial DNA. The presence of rps7-homologous sequences in the nuclear genomes of pea and soybean is consistent with the recent transfer of a functional mitochondrial rps7 gene to the nucleus in certain plant lineages."

"9630507","abstracttext","Protein kinases play important roles in controlling biological functions. We employed PCR-based cloning technique to isolate a protein kinase gene from rice endosperm and obtained a novel protein kinase (REK) cDNA clone from a cDNA library constructed from maturing rice seed. The deduced amino acid sequence from the cDNA exhibited a high similarity to the wheat abscisic acid inducible protein kinase (PKABA1), including 11 conserved regions of the catalytic domain. REK belongs to the SNF1-related family that possesses abundant acidic amino acid resides in the C-terminal region. RT-PCR analysis showed that the REK gene is expressed in leaf and maturing seed, but not in stem and root. Bacterial recombinant REK showed autophosphorylation activity depending upon Ca2+. In addition, we isolated a REK genomic clone and determined its gene structure."
"9669332","articletitle","Cis- and trans-splicing and RNA editing are required for the expression of nad2 in wheat mitochondria."
"9669332","abstracttext","In wheat mitochondria, the gene coding for subunit 2 of the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (nad2) is divided into five exons located in two distant genomic regions. The first two exons of the gene, a and b, lie 22 kb downstream of exons c, d, and e, on the same DNA strand. All introns of nad2 are group II introns. A trans-splicing event is required to join exons b and c. It involves base pairing of the two precursor RNAs in the stem of domain IV of the intron. A gene coding for tRNA(Tyr) is located upstream of exon c. In addition to splicing processes, mRNA editing is also required for the correct expression of nad2. The mature mRNA is edited at 36 positions, distributed over its five exons, resulting in 28 codon modifications. Editing increases protein hydrophobicity and conservation."

"11413224","abstracttext","Ten current European wheat varieties were transformed at efficiencies ranging from 1-17% (mean 4% across varieties) following modifications in particle bombardment and tissue culture procedures. All plants surviving phosphinothricin selection were screened for uidA and bar gene activity, and for the presence of marker gene sequences by PCR analysis. A minimum of 35% plant 'escape' frequency was achieved with selection on 4 mg l(-1) gluphosinate ammonium after shoot initiation. Mean co-transformation frequency with various genes-of-interest was 66%. The estimated number of insertions of the uidA gene in 25 lines were; 1-2 in 32%, 3-5 in 52%, and 6-8 in 16% of lines. In T(1) progenies, marker genes segregated in a Mendelian fashion in 50% of 39 lines analysed, as determined by transgene activity assays. Based on PCR analysis, it appeared that in some lines the occurrence of distorted segregation was due to poor transmission of the transgenes."

"10857256","abstracttext","Common wheat cv. Meri was crossed to a set of 21 Chinese Spring monosomic lines to characterize resistance to powdery mildew and to determine the chromosomal location of the gene(s). Monosomic F1 plants were allowed to self-pollinate and to produce F2 seeds. Seedlings of F2 and F3 plants and their parents were inoculated with isolates Ns 2 and 9 of Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici. Analysis of obtained data revealed that one major dominant gene conferring resistance is located on chromosome 1B of cv. Meri. The new gene is designated by symbol Pm28. On the basis of the trivalent configuration frequency (without univalent) at the 1st metaphase of meiosis it was found that two reciprocal translocations involving chromosomes 2A/5A and 5B/5D differentiate cv. Meri from cv. Chinese Spring. In the F1 monosomic hybrids, genes causing a decrease in pairing are found on chromosomes 4D and 6D, and genes enhancing pairing--on chromosomes 3A and 7B."

"10826696","abstracttext","A beta-1,3-glucanase gene from Hordeum vulgare was isolated by a PCR strategy, cloned and subsequently sequenced. The amplified sequence contained the entire coding region of the isoenzyme II, which is interrupted by a 165 bp intron at 73 bp downstream the starting codon. This intron contains all the elements required for the processing mechanism in monocots: a high A + U content, the appropriate splice sites in the 5' and 3' ends and four typical YUNAN consensus sequences. Transient transformation of wheat protoplasts with the complete beta-1,3-glucanase gene under the control of maize polyubiquitin promoter revealed that the intron sequence was spliced out. The gene was also expressed at high levels, probably due to an enhancer-like sequence found near the 3' end of the intron."
"12369627","articletitle","Plant mitochondrial rps2 genes code for proteins with a C-terminal extension that is processed."
"12369627","abstracttext","A gene (rps2) coding for ribosomal protein S2 (RPS2) is present in the mitochondrial (mt) genome of several monocot plants, but absent from the mtDNA of dicots. Confirming that in dicot plants the corresponding gene has been transferred to the nucleus, a corresponding Arabidopsis thaliana nuclear gene was identified that codes for mitochondrial RPS2. As several yeast and mammalian genes coding for mt ribosomal proteins, the Arabidopsis RPS2 apparently has no N-terminal targeting sequence. In the maize mt genome, two rps2 genes were identified and both are transcribed, although at different levels. As in wheat and rice, the maize genes code for proteins with long C-terminal extensions, as compared to their bacterial counterparts. These extensions are not conserved in sequence. Using specific antibodies against one of the maize proteins we found that a large protein precursor is indeed synthesized, but it is apparently processed to give the mature RPS2 protein which is associated with the mitochondrial ribosome."
"11976683","articletitle","Association of dwarfism and floral induction with a grape 'green revolution' mutation."
"11976683","abstracttext","The transition from vegetative to reproductive growth is an essential process in the life cycle of plants. Plant floral induction pathways respond to both environmental and endogenous cues and much has been learnt about these genetic pathways by studying mutants of Arabidopsis. Gibberellins (GAs) are plant growth regulators important in many aspects of plant growth and in Arabidopsis they promote flowering. Here we provide genetic evidence that GAs inhibit flowering in grapevine. A grapevine dwarf mutant derived from the L1 cell layer of the champagne cultivar Pinot Meunier produces inflorescences along the length of the shoot where tendrils are normally formed. The mutated gene associated with the phenotype is a homologue of the wheat 'green revolution' gene Reduced height-1 (ref. 6) and the Arabidopsis gene GA insensitive (GAI). The conversion of tendrils to inflorescences in the mutant demonstrates that the grapevine tendril is a modified inflorescence inhibited from completing floral development by GAs."

The nagA gene encoded a polypeptide of 600 amino acids with significant similarity to glucosaminidases and hexosaminidases of various eukaryotes. A. oryzae strain carrying the nagA gene under the control of the improved glaA promoter produced large amounts of beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase in a wheat bran solid culture. The beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase was purified from crude extracts of the solid culture by column chromatographies on Q-Sepharose and Sephacryl S-200. This enzyme was used for synthesis of lacto-N-triose II, which is contained in human milk. By reverse hydrolysis reaction, lacto-N-triose II and its positional isomer were synthesized from lactose and D-N-acetylglucosamine in 0.21% and 0.15% yield, respectively."

"12903189","abstracttext","The modifications of N2,N2-dimethylguanine (m2(2)G) are found in tRNAs and rRNAs from eukarya and archaea. In tRNAs, modification at position G26 is generated by tRNA (m2(2)G26) methyltransferase, which is encoded by the corresponding gene, trm1. This enzyme catalyzes the methyl-transfer from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the semi-conserved residue, G26, via the intermediate modified base, m2G26. Recent genome sequencing project has been reported that the putative trm1 is encoded in the genome of Aquifex aeolicus, a hyper-thermophilic eubacterium as only one exception among eubacteria. In order to confirm whether this bacterial trm1 gene product is a real tRNA (m2(2)G26) methyltransferase or not, we expressed this protein by wheat germ in vitro cell-free translation system. Our biochemical analysis clearly showed that this gene product possessed tRNA (m2(2)G26) methyltransferase activity."

"14727053","abstracttext","Fertile transgenic pearl millet plants expressing a phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) transgene under control of the maize ubiquitin constitutive promoter were obtained using the transformation system described here. Proliferating immature zygotic embryos were used as target tissue for bombardment using a particle inflow gun. Different culture and selection strategies were assessed in order to obtain an optimised mannose selection protocol. Stable integration of the manA gene into the genome of pearl millet was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis. Stable integration of the manA transgene into the genome of pearl millet was demonstrated in T1 and T2 progeny of two independent transformation events with no more than four to ten copies of the transgene. Similar to results obtained from previous studies with maize and wheat, the manA gene was shown to be a superior selectable marker gene for improving transformation efficiencies when compared to antibiotic or herbicide selectable marker genes."

"16832356","abstracttext","New diseases of humans, animals and plants emerge regularly. Enhanced virulence on a new host can be facilitated by the acquisition of novel virulence factors. Interspecific gene transfer is known to be a source of such virulence factors in bacterial pathogens (often manifested as pathogenicity islands in the recipient organism) and it has been speculated that interspecific transfer of virulence factors may occur in fungal pathogens. Until now, no direct support has been available for this hypothesis. Here we present evidence that a gene encoding a critical virulence factor was transferred from one species of fungal pathogen to another. This gene transfer probably occurred just before 1941, creating a pathogen population with significantly enhanced virulence and leading to the emergence of a new damaging disease of wheat."

"16874490","abstracttext","Microsatellite markers were used to map the major genes Bg (determining black glume colour), Rg1 and Rg3 (red glume), and a locus determining smokey-grey coloured glume to the distal ends of the short arms of the homoeologous group 1 chromosomes, proximally (or closely linked) to Xgwm1223 and distal to Xgwm0033. On this basis, we propose that these genes represent a set of homoeoloci, designated Rg-A1, Rg-B1, and Rg-D1. Rg3 and Bg appear to be variant alleles of Rg-A1. Both Rg3 and Bg are closely linked with the major glume pubescence gene Hg. Similarly, the hexaploid wheat smokey-grey glume gene and Rg2 represent alleles at Rg-D1. The microsatellite markers linked to the Rg genes were used to analyse a phenotypically and genotypically characterized set of Siberian spring wheats. A coincidence between the presence of the 264-bp allele of Xgwm0136 and Rg-A1b (Rg3) was observed; so Xgwm0136 can probably be used as a diagnostic marker for this gene."

"17177803","abstracttext","Detailed global gene expression profiles have been obtained for a series of transgenic and conventionally bred wheat lines expressing additional genes encoding HMW (high molecular weight) subunits of glutenin, a group of endosperm-specific seed storage proteins known to determine dough strength and therefore bread-making quality. Differences in endosperm and leaf transcriptome profiles between untransformed and derived transgenic lines were consistently extremely small, when analysing plants containing either transgenes only, or also marker genes. Differences observed in gene expression in the endosperm between conventionally bred material were much larger in comparison to differences between transgenic and untransformed lines exhibiting the same complements of gluten subunits. These results suggest that the presence of the transgenes did not significantly alter gene expression and that, at this level of investigation, transgenic plants could be considered substantially equivalent to untransformed parental lines."

"18003669","abstracttext","Tolerance to boron (B) toxicity in cereals is known to be associated with reduced tissue accumulation of B. Genes from roots of B-tolerant cultivars of wheat and barley with high similarities to previously reported B efflux transporters from Arabidopsis and rice were cloned. Expression of these genes was strongly correlated with the ability of tolerant genotypes to lower the concentration of B in roots. The gene from barley located to chromosome 4. Backcross lines containing a B tolerance locus on chromosome 4 showed tolerance in proportion to the level of expression of the transporter gene, whereas those lacking the locus were sensitive to B and had very low levels of gene expression. The results are consistent with a widespread mechanism of tolerance to high B based on efflux of B from root cells."

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that transformant Y2 produced mRNA of the efe gene. Southern blot analysis showed that there was one copy of efe gene which was integrated into the chromosomal DNA of T. viride. Ethylene production by transformant Y2 was efficiently induced by cellulose, while very low level of ethylene was produced when sodium carboxymethyl cellulose or lactose was used as carbon source. Peptone exerted a much greater stimulatory effect on ethylene production. A high level of ethylene was produced when transformant Y2 was cultured in solid fermentation medium containing wheat straw, indicating that plant wastes could be directly converted to ethylene by the recombinant filamentous fungus."

"22522694","abstracttext_background","Fusarium head blight caused by Gibberella zeae is an important disease of wheat and barley because it reduces grain yield and quality and results in the contamination of grain with mycotoxins. Recent studies have shown that carbendazim resistance in field strains of G. zeae is not caused by mutation of the Î²-tubulin gene (Î²â tub), which is the case with other filamentous fungi, but that fungicide resistance is greatly increased by deletion of Î²â tub. The aim of the present study was to clarify the function of Î²â tub and its role in carbendazim resistance in G. zeae by artificial gene operation."

"19347657","abstracttext","In the post-genomic era, it is necessary to adapt methods for gene expression and functional analyses to more high-throughput levels of processing. mRNA in situ hybridization (ISH) remains a powerful tool for obtaining information regarding a gene's temporal and spatial expression pattern and can therefore be used as a starting point to define the function of a gene or a whole set of genes. We have deconstructed 'traditional' ISH techniques described for a range of organisms and developed protocols for ISH that adapt and integrate a degree of automation to standardized and shortened protocols. We have adapted this technique as a high-throughput means of gene expression analysis on wax-embedded plant tissues and also on whole-mount tissues. We have used wax-embedded wheat grains and Arabidopsis floral meristems and whole-mount Arabidopsis roots as test systems and show that it is capable of highly parallel processing."

"19470492","abstracttext","The continuous improvement of crop plants is essential for agriculture in the coming decades and relies on the use of genetic variability through breeding. However, domestication and modern breeding have reduced diversity in the crop germplasm. Global gene banks conserve diversity, but these resources remain underexplored owing to a lack of efficient strategies to isolate important alleles. Here we describe a large-scale allele-mining project at the molecular level. We first selected a set of 1,320 bread wheat landraces from a database of 16,089 accessions, using the focused identification of germplasm strategy. On the basis of a hierarchical selection procedure on this set, we then isolated 7 resistance alleles of the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm3, doubling the known functional allelic diversity at this locus. This targeted approach for molecular utilization of gene bank accessions reveals landraces as a rich resource of new functional alleles. This strategy can be implemented for other studies on the molecular diversity of agriculturally important genes, as well as for molecular breeding."

"22352374","abstracttext","A metagenomic library of China Holstein cow rumen microbes was constructed and screened for novel gene cluster. A novel feruloyl esterase (FAE) gene was identified with a length of 789 bp and encoded a protein displaying 56% identity to known esterase sequences. The gene was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and the total molecular weight of the recombined protein was 32.4 kDa. The purified enzyme showed a broad specificity against the four methyl esters of hydroxycinnamic acids and high activity (259.5 U/mg) to methyl ferulate at optimum conditions (pH 8.0, 40 Â°C). High thermal and pH stability were also observed. Moreover, the enzyme showed broad resistance to proteases. FAE-SH1 can enhance the release of ferulic acid from wheat straw with cellulase, Î²-1,4-endoxylanase, Î²-1,3-glucanase, and pectase. These features suggest FAE-SH1 as a good candidate to enhance biomass degradation and improve the health effects of food and forage."

"24469829","abstracttext","The Arabidopsis cyclin-dependent kinase G (CDKG) gene defines a clade of cyclin-dependent protein kinases related to CDK10 and CDK11, as well as to the enigmatic Ph1-related kinases that are implicated in controlling homeologous chromosome pairing in wheat. Here we demonstrate that the CDKG1/CYCLINL complex is essential for synapsis and recombination during male meiosis. A transfer-DNA insertional mutation in the cdkg1 gene leads to a temperature-sensitive failure of meiosis in late Zygotene/Pachytene that is associated with defective formation of the synaptonemal complex, reduced bivalent formation and crossing over, and aneuploid gametes. An aphenotypic insertion in the cyclin L gene, a cognate cyclin for CDKG, strongly enhances the phenotype of cdkg1-1 mutants, indicating that this cdk-cyclin complex is essential for male meiosis. Since CYCLINL, CDKG, and their mammalian homologs have been previously shown to affect mRNA processing, particularly alternative splicing, our observations also suggest a mechanism to explain the widespread phenomenon of thermal sensitivity in male meiosis."

"24263924","abstracttext","The effects of the 'Tom Thumb' Rht3 dwarfing gene in wheat on plant height, yield components and grain quality in field trials of random inbred lines from two 'Minister Dwarf' (Rht3) x rht3 crosses are described. Limited genetic increases in Rht3 plant height, up to 70 cm, were achieved by incorporating genes from the extremely tall variety 'April Bearded'. Amongst lines from the higher yielding cross, the dwarfing gene did not reduce grain yield but was associated with an increase in grain number of over 25%. Although Rht3 reduced grain protein content by up to 0.8%, breadmaking quality, as measured by SDS sedimentation values and baking tests, was not affected. A controlled environment experiment with near-isogenic Rht3 and rht3 lines indicated that reduced grain size in the dwarfs is a competitive response to the increase in fertility rather than a primary effect of the dwarfing gene."

The latter allele, Î±-Amy-B2b carried by the variety 'Hope', was used to locate the enzyme structural gene within chromosome 7B relative to the centromere and five other gene markers.The nature of the Î±-Amy-B2b phenotype and the rare non-parental isozyme patterns found among the recombinant lines indicates that the locus is large and compound, probably involving some degree of intra-locus gene duplication."

Plants having short stature, early heading, early maturity, and acceptable levels of resistance were identified in the F2 population whenRht 2 was present.

"27110767","abstracttext","The objective of this research was to characterize the high level of resistance to stripe that has been observed in the released wheat cultivar, Chuanmai45. A combination of classic genetic analysis, molecular and cytogenetic methods were used to characterize resistance in an Fâ population derived from Chuanmai45 and the susceptible Chuanmai42. Inheritance of resistance was shown to be conferred by two genes in Chuanmai45. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used along with segregation studies to show that one gene was located on a 1RS.1BL translocation. Molecular markers were employed to show that the other locus was located on chromosome 4B. The defeated gene, Yr24/26, on chromosome 1BL was present in the susceptible parent and lines that recombined this gene with the 1RS.1BL translocation were identified. The germplasm, loci, and associated markers identified in this study will be useful for application in breeding programs utilizing marker-assisted selection."

"31134016","abstracttext","Eukaryotic ribosomes are essential for proliferation, differentiation, and cell growth. RPs26 is a ribosomal subunit structural protein involved in the growth and development process. Little is known about the function of PsRPs26 in pathogenic fungi. In this study, we isolated the RPs26 gene, PsRPs26 , from Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ). PsRPs26 contains a eukaryotic-specific Y62-K70 motif and is more than 90% identical with its ortholog gene in other fungi. PsRPs26 was found to be localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Expression of PsRPs26 increased when wheat seedlings were inoculated with the Pst CYR31 isolate. Moreover, knockdown of PsRPs26 by a host-induced gene silencing system inhibited growth and limited urediospore production in Pst . Our discovery that PsRPs26 may contribute to the pathogenicity of Pst and open a new way in the pathogenic function of PsRPs26 in cereal rust fungi."

"32208137","abstracttext","Understanding the function of genes within staple crops will accelerate crop improvement by allowing targeted breeding approaches. Despite their importance, a lack of genomic information and resources has hindered the functional characterisation of genes in major crops. The recent release of high-quality reference sequences for these crops underpins a suite of genetic and genomic resources that support basic research and breeding. For wheat, these include gene model annotations, expression atlases and gene networks that provide information about putative function. Sequenced mutant populations, improved transformation protocols and structured natural populations provide rapid methods to study gene function directly. We highlight a case study exemplifying how to integrate these resources. This review provides a helpful guide for plant scientists, especially those expanding into crop research, to capitalise on the discoveries made in Arabidopsis and other plants. This will accelerate the improvement of crops of vital importance for food and nutrition security."

"29959543","abstracttext","The last decade has seen significant strides in Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation technology. This has not only expanded the number of crop species that can be transformed by Agrobacterium, but has also made it possible to routinely transform several recalcitrant crop species including cereals (e.g., maize, sorghum, and wheat). However, the technology is limited by the random nature of DNA insertions, genotype dependency, low frequency of quality events, and variation in gene expression arising from genomic insertion sites. A majority of these deficiencies have now been addressed by improving the frequency of quality events, developing genotype-independent transformation capability in maize, developing an Agrobacterium-based site-specific integration technology for precise gene targeting, and adopting Agrobacterium-delivered CRISPR-Cas genes for gene editing. These improved transformation technologies are discussed in detail in this chapter."

We applied the MGE construct built by combining the tandemly arrayed tRNA-gRNA units to generate heritable mutations in the TaGW2 , TaLpx-1 , and TaMLO genes of hexaploid wheat. The knockout mutations generated by this construct in all three homoeologous copies of one of the target genes, TaGW2 , resulted in a substantial increase in seed size and thousand grain weight. We showed that the non-modified gRNA targets in the early generation plants can be edited by CRISPR-Cas9 in the following generations. Our results demonstrate that transgenerational gene editing activity can serve as the source of novel variation in the progeny of CRISPR-Cas9-expressing plants and suggest that the Cas9-inducible trait transfer for crop improvement can be achieved by crossing the plants expressing the gene editing constructs with the lines of interest."

"31575748","abstracttext","Plants are vulnerable to disease through pathogen manipulation of phytohormone levels, which otherwise regulate development, abiotic, and biotic responses. Here, we show that the wheat pathogen Xanthomonas translucens pv. undulosa elevates expression of the host gene encoding 9- cis -epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase ( TaNCED-5BS ), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of the phytohormone abscisic acid and a component of a major abiotic stress-response pathway, to promote disease susceptibility. Gene induction is mediated by a type III transcription activator-like effector. The induction of TaNCED-5BS results in elevated abscisic acid levels, reduced host transpiration and water loss, enhanced spread of bacteria in infected leaves, and decreased expression of the central defense gene TaNPR1 The results represent an appropriation of host physiology by a bacterial virulence effector."

"32949136","abstracttext","The induced dwarf mutant Rht12 was previously shown to have agronomic potential to replace the conventional DELLA mutants Rht-B1b/Rht-D1b in wheat. The Rht12 dwarfing gene is not associated with reduced coleoptile length (unlike the DELLA mutants), and it is dominant, characteristics which are shared with the previously characterised dwarfing genes Rht18 and Rht14. Using the Rht18/Rht14 model, a GA 2-oxidase gene was identified in the Rht12 region on chromosome 5A. A screen for suppressor mutants in the Rht12 background identified tall overgrowth individuals that were shown to contain loss of function mutations in GA2oxidaseA13, demonstrating the role of this gene in the Rht12 dwarf phenotype. It was concluded that Rht12, Rht18 and Rht14 share the same height-reducing mechanism through the increased expression of GA 2-oxidase genes. Some of the overgrowth mutants generated in this study were semi-dwarf and taller than the original Rht12 dwarf, providing breeders with new sources of agronomically useful dwarfism."

This freely available electronic tool facilitates the information-rich design of protein constructs and their engineered synthetic gene sequences, as detailed in the accompanying manuscript."
"19383143","abstracttext_results","In this report, we compare heterologous protein expression levels from native sequences to that of codon engineered synthetic gene constructs designed by Gene Composer. A test set of proteins including a human kinase (P38alpha), viral polymerase (HCV NS5B), and bacterial structural protein (FtsZ) were expressed in both E. coli and a cell-free wheat germ translation system. We also compare the protein expression levels in E. coli for a set of 11 different proteins with greatly varied G:C content and codon bias."
"19383143","abstracttext_conclusion","The results consistently demonstrate that protein yields from codon engineered Gene Composer designs are as good as or better than those achieved from the synonymous native genes. Moreover, structure guided N- and C-terminal deletion constructs designed with the aid of Gene Composer can lead to greater success in gene to structure work as exemplified by the X-ray crystallographic structure determination of FtsZ from Bacillus subtilis. These results validate the Gene Composer algorithms, and suggest that using a combination of synthetic gene and protein construct engineering tools can improve the economics of gene to structure research."

"18794528","abstracttext","Zea mays, commonly known as corn, is perhaps the most greatly produced crop in terms of tonnage and a major food, feed, and biofuel resource. Here we analyzed its prolamin gene family, encoding the major seed storage proteins, as a model for gene evolution by syntenic alignments with sorghum and rice, two genomes that have been sequenced recently. Because a high-density gene map has been constructed for maize inbred B73, all prolamin gene copies can be identified in their chromosomal context. Alignment of respective chromosomal regions of these species via conserved genes allow us to identify the pedigree of prolamin gene copies in space and time. Its youngest and largest gene family, the alpha prolamins, arose about 22-26 million years ago (Mya) after the split of the Panicoideae (including maize, sorghum, and millet) from the Pooideae (including wheat, barley, and oats) and Oryzoideae (rice). The first dispersal of alpha prolamin gene copies occurred before the split of the progenitors of maize and sorghum about 11.9 Mya. One of the two progenitors of maize gained a new alpha zein locus, absent in the other lineage, to form a nonduplicated locus in maize after allotetraplodization about 4.8 Mya. But dispersed copies gave rise to tandem duplications through uneven expansion and gene silencing of this gene family in maize and sorghum, possibly because of maize's greater recombination and mutation rates resulting from its diploidization process. Interestingly, new gene loci in maize represent junctions of ancestral chromosome fragments and sites of new centromeres in sorghum and rice."

"10588758","abstracttext","Biochemically active wheat thioredoxin h has been overexpressed in the endosperm of transgenic barley grain. Two DNA constructs containing the wheat thioredoxin h gene (wtrxh) were used for transformation; each contained wtrxh fused to an endosperm-specific B(1)-hordein promoter either with or without a signal peptide sequence for targeting to the protein body. Twenty-two stable, independently transformed regenerable lines were obtained by selecting with the herbicide bialaphos to test for the presence of the bar herbicide resistance gene on a cotransformed plasmid; all were positive for this gene. The presence of wtrxh was confirmed in 20 lines by PCR analysis, and the identity and level of expression of wheat thioredoxin h was assessed by immunoblots. Although levels varied among the different transgenic events, wheat thioredoxin h was consistently highly expressed (up to 30-fold) in the transgenic grain. Transgenic lines transformed with the B(1)-hordein promoter with a signal peptide sequence produced a higher level of wheat thioredoxin h on average than those without a signal sequence. The overexpression of thioredoxin h in the endosperm of germinated grain effected up to a 4-fold increase in the activity of the starch debranching enzyme, pullulanase (limit dextrinase), the enzyme that specifically cleaves alpha-1,6 linkages in starch. These results raise the question of how thioredoxin h enhances the activity of pullulanase because it was found that the inhibitor had become inactive before the enzyme showed appreciable activity."

"11407891","abstracttext","The objective of this study was to quantify the effect of specific physical and biological factors on the relative likelihood of biomechanical failure in wheat. Wind-related crop damage is a major obstacle to wheat production that costs several billion dollars per year. The four factors varied in this study were breeding line, dwarfing gene dose, soil type, and fertilization. A theoretical model describing the dynamic structural response of living plants was used to define margins of safety against global buckling, anchorage rotation, and tissue rupture. These relative safety factors were defined for each treatment in comparison with a tall wheat variety selected from a breeding line called Seri and grown in sandy soil with low fertilization. Compared to this reference, the relative safety factor against global buckling was increased (+39%, p<0.01), and the relative safety factor against anchorage rotation was decreased (-11%, p<0.025), by one allele of the dwarfing gene. The relative safety factor against tissue rupture was unaffected by the dwarfing gene but was consistently lower (-26%, p<0.01) in a second breeding line called Kauz. Soil type and fertility did not affect the relative safety factors and this negative finding was significant at p<0.05. The key finding was that the strength of wheat was affected more by genetic rather than by environmental factors, which suggests that some varieties are intrinsically more robust than others. Also, the relative safety factor against anchorage rotation was inversely proportional to the relative safety factor against buckling, which suggests that there are competing constraints on the dynamic structural behavior of wheat."
"12582874","articletitle","Microsatellite analysis of wheat chromosome 2D allows the reconstruction of chromosomal inheritance in pedigrees of breeding programmes."
"12582874","abstracttext","The dwarfing gene Rht8 and the photoperiodic insensitivity gene Ppd-D1 are linked on the short arm of chromosome 2D of bread wheat and play an important role in determining the geographic adaptation of modern wheat varieties. The genes are believed to originate from the old Japanese variety 'Akakomugi' and have been distributed throughout the world by diverse breeding programmes. Twelve microsatellite loci previously mapped on wheat chromosome 2D were used for a retrospective analysis of 59 wheat varieties with known pedigree, to trace the transmittance of the chromosomal region around these genes during extended breeding programmes. Within the range of the screened varieties 100 alleles were detected at the 12 microsatellite loci. For each microsatellite locus, a screen over varieties was performed to find the alleles corresponding to the parental variety 'Akakomugi'. A comparison of wheat varieties carrying the 192-bp allele, at locus Xgwm261-2D which is diagnostic for the presence of the gene Rht8, with the varieties without Rht8, showed linkage disequilibrium of 'Akakomugi' alleles for a segment of chromosome 2D which comprised at least 28 cM. Selection was accompanied with a linkage drag of 'Akakomugi' alleles in the neighbouring loci to Rht8. A diminution of the segment of chromosome 2D originating from 'Akakomugi' during several pedigree generations was observed. Varieties of the early generations were found to carry the whole short arm of chromosome 2D of 'Akakomugi', while the varieties of further selections possessed smaller segments including the diagnostic allele at locus Xgwm261-2D. Our results demonstrate that microsatellites can be successfully used for studying the inheritance of chromosomes within pedigrees of breeding programmes."
"15805493","articletitle","Ancient haplotypes resulting from extensive molecular rearrangements in the wheat A genome have been maintained in species of three different ploidy levels."
"15805493","abstracttext","Plant genomes, in particular grass genomes, evolve very rapidly. The closely related A genomes of diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid wheat are derived from a common ancestor that lived <3 million years ago and represent a good model to study molecular mechanisms involved in such rapid evolution. We have sequenced and compared physical contigs at the Lr10 locus on chromosome 1AS from diploid (211 kb), tetraploid (187 kb), and hexaploid wheat (154 kb). A maximum of 33% of the sequences were conserved between two species. The sequences from diploid and tetraploid wheat shared all of the genes, including Lr10 and RGA2 and define a first haplotype (H1). The 130-kb intergenic region between Lr10 and RGA2 was conserved in size despite its activity as a hot spot for transposon insertion, which resulted in >70% of sequence divergence. The hexaploid wheat sequence lacks both Lr10 and RGA2 genes and defines a second haplotype, H2, which originated from ancient and extensive rearrangements. These rearrangements included insertions of retroelements and transposons deletions, as well as unequal recombination within elements. Gene disruption in haplotype H2 was caused by a deletion and subsequent large inversion. Gene conservation between H1 haplotypes, as well as conservation of rearrangements at the origin of the H2 haplotype at three different ploidy levels indicate that the two haplotypes are ancient and had a stable gene content during evolution, whereas the intergenic regions evolved rapidly. Polyploidization during wheat evolution had no detectable consequences on the structure and evolution of the two haplotypes."

"16344983","abstracttext","Kernel hardness that is conditioned by puroindoline genes has a profound effect on milling, baking and end-use quality of bread wheat. In this study, 219 landraces and 166 historical cultivars from China and 12 introduced wheats were investigated for their kernel hardness and puroindoline alleles, using molecular and biochemical markers. The results indicated that frequencies of soft, mixed and hard genotypes were 42.7, 24.3, and 33.0%, respectively, in Chinese landraces and 45.2, 13.9, and 40.9% in historical cultivars. The frequencies of PINA null, Pinb-D1b and Pinb-D1p genotypes were 43.8, 12.3, and 39.7%, respectively, in hard wheat of landraces, while 48.5, 36.8, and 14.7%, respectively, in historical hard wheats. A new Pinb-D1 allele, designated Pinb-D1t, was identified in two landraces, Guangtouxianmai and Hongmai from the Guizhou province, with the characterization of a glycine to arginine substitution at position 47 in the coding region of Pinb gene. Surprisingly, a new Pina-D1 allele, designated Pina-D1m, was detected in the landrace Hongheshang, from the Jiangsu province, with the characterization of a proline to serine substitution at position 35 in the coding region of Pina gene; it was the first novel mutation found in bread wheat, resulting in a hard endosperm with PINA expression. Among the PINA null genotypes, an allele designed as Pina-D1l, was detected in five landraces with a cytosine deletion at position 265 in Pina locus; while another novel Pina-D1 allele, designed as Pina-D1n, was identified in six landraces, with the characterization of an amino acid change from tryptophan-43 to a 'stop' codon in the coding region of Pina gene. The study of puroindoline polymorphism in Chinese wheat germplasm could provide useful information for the further understanding of the molecular basis of kernel hardness in bread wheat."
"19816671","articletitle","Identification and characterization of a novel host-toxin interaction in the wheat-Stagonospora nodorum pathosystem."
"19816671","abstracttext","Stagonospora nodorum, casual agent of Stagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB) of wheat, produces a number of host-selective toxins (HSTs) known to be important in disease. To date, four HSTs and corresponding host sensitivity genes have been reported, and all four host-toxin interactions are significant factors in the development of disease. Here, we describe the identification and partial characterization of a fifth S. nodorum produced HST designated SnTox4. The toxin, estimated to be 10-30 kDa in size, was found to be proteinaceous in nature. Sensitivity to SnTox4 is governed by a single dominant gene, designated Snn4, which mapped to the short arm of wheat chromosome 1A in a recombinant inbred (RI) population. The compatible Snn4-SnTox4 interaction is light dependent and results in a mottled necrotic reaction, which is different from the severe necrosis that results from other host-toxin interactions in the wheat-S. nodorum pathosystem. QTL analysis in a population of 200 RI lines derived from the Swiss winter wheat varieties Arina and Forno revealed a major QTL for SNB susceptibility that coincided with the Snn4 locus. This QTL, designated QSnb.fcu-1A, explained 41.0% of the variation in disease on leaves of seedlings indicating that a compatible Snn4-SnTox4 interaction plays a major role in the development of SNB in this population. Additional minor QTL detected on the short arms of chromosomes 2A and 3A accounted for 5.4 and 6.0% of the variation, respectively. The effects of the three QTL were largely additive, and together they explained 50% of the total phenotypic variation. These results provide further evidence that host-toxin interactions in the wheat-S. nodorum pathosystem follow an inverse gene-for-gene model."

"21811818","abstracttext","The recent emergence of wheat stem rust Ug99 and evolution of new races within the lineage threatens global wheat production because they overcome widely deployed stem rust resistance (Sr) genes that had been effective for many years. To identify loci conferring adult plant resistance to races of Ug99 in wheat, we employed an association mapping approach for 276 current spring wheat breeding lines from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT). Breeding lines were genotyped with Diversity Array Technology (DArT) and microsatellite markers. Phenotypic data was collected on these lines for stem rust race Ug99 resistance at the adult plant stage in the stem rust resistance screening nursery in Njoro, Kenya in seasons 2008, 2009 and 2010. Fifteen marker loci were found to be significantly associated with stem rust resistance. Several markers appeared to be linked to known Sr genes, while other significant markers were located in chromosome regions where no Sr genes have been previously reported. Most of these new loci colocalized with QTLs identified recently in different biparental populations. Using the same data and QÂ +Â K covariate matrices, we investigated the interactions among marker loci using linear regression models to calculate P values for pairwise marker interactions. Resistance marker loci including the Sr2 locus on 3BS and the wPt1859 locus on 7DL had significant interaction effects with other loci in the same chromosome arm and with markers on chromosome 6B. Other resistance marker loci had significant pairwise interactions with markers on different chromosomes. Based on these results, we propose that a complex network of gene-gene interactions is, in part, responsible for resistance to Ug99. Further investigation may provide insight for understanding mechanisms that contribute to this resistance gene network."

Finally, we identify thirty-six different transcripts forms originated by alternative splicing of the 5' UTR and/or exons 1 to 5 of Psy1 gene. Transcripts function is tested in a heterologous complementation assay, revealing that from the sixteen different predicted proteins only four types (those of 432, 370, 364 and 271 amino acids), are functional in the bacterial system."

"23536608","abstracttext","Low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS), encoded by a complex multigene family, play an important role in the processing quality of wheat flour. Although members of this gene family have been identified in several wheat varieties, the allelic variation and composition of LMW-GS genes in common wheat are not well understood. In the present study, using the LMW-GS gene molecular marker system and the full-length gene cloning method, a comprehensive molecular analysis of LMW-GS genes was conducted in a representative population, the micro-core collections (MCC) of Chinese wheat germplasm. Generally, >15 LMW-GS genes were identified from individual MCC accessions, of which 4-6 were located at the Glu-A3 locus, 3-5 at the Glu-B3 locus, and eight at the Glu-D3 locus. LMW-GS genes at the Glu-A3 locus showed the highest allelic diversity, followed by the Glu-B3 genes, while the Glu-D3 genes were extremely conserved among MCC accessions. Expression and sequence analysis showed that 9-13 active LMW-GS genes were present in each accession. Sequence identity analysis showed that all i-type genes present at the Glu-A3 locus formed a single group, the s-type genes located at Glu-B3 and Glu-D3 loci comprised a unique group, while high-diversity m-type genes were classified into four groups and detected in all Glu-3 loci. These results contribute to the functional analysis of LMW-GS genes and facilitate improvement of bread-making quality by wheat molecular breeding programmes."

"24085532","abstracttext","Exploiting and utilizing excellent gene(s) from wild species has become an essential strategy for wheat improvement. In the disomic addition line 24-6-3, the 4Ns chromosomes from Psathyrostachys huashanica Keng (2nÂ =Â 2xÂ =Â 14, NsNs) carried valuable tiller and strip rust resistance gene(s), which was selected from the progeny of common wheat cv. 7182 and P. huashanica via embryo culture. Cytology, genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), and EST-STS analyses were used to detect the 4Ns chromosome in wheat background and its homoeologous relationship. Cytological studies demonstrated that 24-6-3 contained 44 chromosomes and formed 22 bivalents during meiotic metaphase I. GISH using P. huashanica genomic DNA as a probe indicated that a pair of Ns-chromosomes with strong hybridization signals had been introduced into 24-6-3. Ten EST-STS markers, i.e., BE404973, BE442811, BE446061, BE446076, BE497324, BE591356, BF473854, BG274986, BQ161513 and CD373484, which were located on the homoeologous group 4 chromosomes of wheat, amplified bands unique to P. huashanica in 24-6-3. This indicated the presence of an introgressed P. huashanica Ns chromosome pair belonging to homoeologous group 4, which we designated the 4Ns disomic addition line. After it was inoculated using mixed races of stripe rust in the adult stages, 24-6-3 expressed high stripe rust resistance, which was possibly derived from its P. huashanica parent. Moreover, its increased number of tillers was probably controlled by gene(s) located in P. huashanica chromosome 4Ns. These high levels of disease resistance and excellent agronomic traits make the 24-6-3 line a promising germplasm for breeding in wheat."

"23836161","abstracttext","Rye is an important and valuable gene resource for wheat improvement. However, due to extensive growing of cultivars with disease resistance genes from short arm of rye chromosome 1R and coevolution of pathogen virulence and host resistance, these cultivars successively lost resistance to pathogens. Identification and deployment of new resistance gene sources in rye are, therefore, of especial importance and urgency. A new wheat-rye line, designated as WR41-1, was produced through distant hybridization and chromosome engineering protocols between common wheat cultivar Xiaoyan 6 and rye cultivar German White. It was proved to be a new wheat-rye T4BLÂ·4RL and T7ASÂ·4RS translocation line using sequential genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (mc-FISH), and expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) marker analysis. WR41-1 showed high levels of resistance to powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, Bgt) pathogens prevalent in China at the adult growth stage and 13 of 23 Bgt isolates tested at the seedling stage. According to its resistant pattern to 23 different Bgt isolates, WR41-1 may possess new gene(s) for resistance to powdery mildew, which differed from previously identified and known powdery mildew genes from rye (Pm7, Pm8, Pm17, and Pm20). In addition, WR41-1 was cytologically stable, had a desirable fertility, and is expected to be useful in wheat improvement."

Crosses between resistant 'Balbo' rye and susceptible 'Suwon 92' wheat and between the F1 amphidiploids and susceptible 'TAM 106' and 'Amigo' wheats produced resistant BC2F3 lines that were identified by C-banding analysis as being 6RL telocentric addition lines. Comparative chromosomal analyses and resistance tests revealed that the resistance gene is located on the 6RL telocentric chromosome. X-irradiated pollen of 6RL addition plants was used to fertilize plants of susceptible wheats 'TAM 106,' 'TAM 101,' and 'Vona.' After several generations of selection for resistance, new sublines were obtained that were homogeneous for resistance. Thirteen of these lines were analyzed by C-banding, and three different wheat-6RL chromosomal translocations (T) were identified. Wheat chromosomes involved in the translocations were 6B, 4B, and 4A. Almost the complete 6RL arm is present in T6BS Â· 6BL-6RL. Only the distal half of 6RL is present in T4BS Â· 4BL-6RL, which locates the resistance gene in the distal half of 6RL. Only a very small segment (ca 1.0 Î¼m) of the distal region of 6RL is present in an intercalary translocation (Ti) Ti4AS Â· 4AL-6RL-4AL. The 6RL segment is inserted in the intercalary region between the centromere of chromosome 4A and the large proximal C-band of 4AL. The break-points of the translocations are outside the region of the centromere, indicating that they were induced by the X-ray treatment. All three translocations are cytologically stable and can be used directly in wheat breeding programs."

"26176552","abstracttext_results","The genetic variability of AX content was investigated in a set of 104 tetraploid wheat genotypes and regions attributable to AX content were identified through a genome wide association study (GWAS). The amount of arabinoxylan, expressed as percentage (w/w) of the dry weight of the kernel, ranged from 1.8% to 5.5% with a mean value of 4.0%. The GWAS revealed a total of 37 significant marker-trait associations (MTA), identifying 19 quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with AX content. The highest number of MTAs was identified on chromosome 5A (seven), where three QTL regions were associated with AX content, while the lowest number of MTAs was detected on chromosomes 2B and 4B, where only one MTA identified a single locus. Conservation of synteny between SNP marker sequences and the annotated genes and proteins in Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa and Sorghum bicolor allowed the identification of nine QTL coincident with candidate genes. These included a glycosyl hydrolase GH35, which encodes Gal7 and a glucosyltransferase GT31 on chromosome 1A; a cluster of GT1 genes on chromosome 2B that includes TaUGT1 and cisZog1; a glycosyl hydrolase that encodes a CelC gene on chromosome 3A; Ugt12887 and TaUGT1genes on chromosome 5A; a (1,3)-Î²-D-glucan synthase (Gsl12 gene) and a glucosyl hydrolase (Cel8 gene) on chromosome 7A."

"26840746","abstracttext","Pathogens like Puccinia triticina, the causal organism for leaf rust, extensively damages wheat production. The interaction at molecular level between wheat and the pathogen is complex and less explored. The pathogen induced response was characterized using mock- or pathogen inoculated near-isogenic wheat lines (with or without seedling leaf rust resistance gene Lr28). Four Serial Analysis of Gene Expression libraries were prepared from mock- and pathogen inoculated plants and were subjected to Sequencing by Oligonucleotide Ligation and Detection, which generated a total of 165,767,777 reads, each 35 bases long. The reads were processed and multiple k-mers were attempted for de novo transcript assembly; 22 k-mers showed the best results. Altogether 21,345 contigs were generated and functionally characterized by gene ontology annotation, mining for transcription factors and resistance genes. Expression analysis among the four libraries showed extensive alterations in the transcriptome in response to pathogen infection, reflecting reorganizations in major biological processes and metabolic pathways. Role of auxin in determining pathogenesis in susceptible and resistant lines were imperative. The qPCR expression study of four LRR-RLK (Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinases) genes showed higher expression at 24 hrs after inoculation with pathogen. In summary, the conceptual model of induced resistance in wheat contributes insights on defense responses and imparts knowledge of Puccinia triticina-induced defense transcripts in wheat plants."

"27423334","abstracttext_background","The current approach to reducing the tendency for wheat grown under high fertilizer conditions to collapse (lodge) under the weight of its grain is based on reducing stem height via the introduction of Rht genes. However, these reduce the yield of straw (itself an important commodity) and introduce other undesirable characteristics. Identification of alternative height-control loci is therefore of key interest. In addition, the improvement of stem mechanical strength provides a further way through which lodging can be reduced."
"27423334","abstracttext_results","To investigate the prospects for genetic alternatives to Rht, we assessed variation for plant height and stem strength properties in a training genetic diversity panel of 100 wheat accessions fixed for Rht. Using mRNAseq data derived from RNA purified from leaves, functional genotypes were developed for the panel comprising 42,066 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers and 94,060 Gene Expression Markers (GEMs). In the first application in wheat of the recently-developed method of Associative Transcriptomics, we identified associations between trait variation and both SNPs and GEMs. Analysis of marker-trait associations revealed candidates for the causative genes underlying the trait variation, implicating xylan acetylation and the COP9 signalosome as contributing to stem strength and auxin in the control of the observed variation for plant height. Predictive capabilities of key markers for stem strength were validated using a test genetic diversity panel of 30 further wheat accessions."
"27423334","abstracttext_conclusions","This work illustrates the power of Associative Transcriptomics for the exploration of complex traits of high agronomic importance in wheat. The careful selection of genotypes included in the analysis, allowed for high resolution mapping of novel trait-controlling loci in this staple crop. The use of Gene Expression markers coupled with the more traditional sequence-based markers, provides the power required to understand the biological context of the marker-trait associations observed. This not only adds to the wealth of knowledge that we strive to accumulate regarding gene function and plant adaptation, but also provides breeders with the information required to make more informed decisions regarding the potential consequences of incorporating the use of particular markers into future breeding programmes."
"29191011","articletitle","Use of Lentinan To Control Sharp Eyespot of Wheat, and the Mechanism Involved."
"29191011","abstracttext","Lentinan (LNT), a complex polysaccharide with a Î²-(1â3)-linked backbone of d-glucose residues, has been reported to inhibit plant diseases. Our objective was to explore the efficacy and action mechanism of LNT used as a seed dressing to control sharp eyespot of wheat. Seed dressing promoted wheat growth. At control germination rates of 50%, 8 g of LNT/100 kg of seeds of the Jimai 22, Shannong 23, and Luyuan 502 cultivars significantly increased seed germination to 54%, 52%, and 51%, respectively. Seven days after emergence, the heights and root activity of wheat treated with LNT were significantly greater than those of controls. These effects were dose-dependent. At this time, the plant heights of Jimai 22, Shannong 23, and Luyuan 502 cultivars were 9.52, 8.52, and 10.52 cm, respectively, significantly higher than that of the controls. LNT prevented the development of wheat sharp eyespot. In the highly susceptible Jimai 22 cultivar, sharp eyespot development was reduced by 33.7%, 31.9%, and 30.4% at 7, 14, and 21 days after germination. LNT somewhat increased phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase activity; reduced the malondialdehyde content; increased chlorophyll a and b levels; and enhanced the root vigor of wheat. These effects peaked 7 days after germination. LNT increased transcription of the genes encoding alternative oxidase (AOX) and Î²-1,3-glucanase (GLU), the salicylic acid signaling pathway-related gene NbPR1a, and the sharp eyespot resistance-related gene RS33. A significant dose-effect relationship was evident in terms of AOX transcription; we thus speculate that AOX may be the target gene."

"27978816","abstracttext_background","Wild relatives of wheat play a significant role in wheat improvement as a source of genetic diversity. Stem rust disease of wheat causes significant yield losses at the global level and stem rust pathogen race TTKSK (Ug99) is virulent to most previously deployed resistance genes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify loci conferring resistance to stem rust pathogen races including Ug99 in an Aegilops umbelluata bi-parental mapping population using genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) SNP markers."
"27978816","abstracttext_results","A bi-parental F 2:3 population derived from a cross made between stem rust resistant accession PI 298905 and stem rust susceptible accession PI 542369 was used for this study. F 2 individuals were evaluated with stem rust race TTTTF followed by testing F 2:3 families with races TTTTF and TTKSK. The segregation pattern of resistance to both stem rust races suggested the presence of one resistance gene. A genetic linkage map, comprised 1,933 SNP markers, was created for all seven chromosomes of Ae. umbellulata using GBS. A major stem rust resistance QTL that explained 80% and 52% of the phenotypic variations for TTTTF and TTKSK, respectively, was detected on chromosome 2U of Ae. umbellulata."
"27978816","abstracttext_conclusion","The novel resistance gene for stem rust identified in this study can be transferred to commercial wheat varieties assisted by the tightly linked markers identified here.

"29353419","articletitle","Pleiotropic effects of the wheat domestication gene Q on yield and grain morphology."
"29353419","abstracttext_main conclusion","Transformation from q to Q during wheat domestication functioned outside the boundary of threshability to increase yield, grains m -2 , grain weight and roundness, but to reduce grains per spike/spikelet. Mutation of the Q gene, well-known affecting wheat spike structure, represents a key domestication step in the formation of today's free-threshing, economically important wheats. In a previous study, multiple yield components and spike characteristics were associated with the Q gene interval in the bread wheat 'Forno'Â ÃÂ European spelt 'Oberkulmer' recombinant inbred line population. Here, we reported that this interval was also associated with grain yield, grainsÂ m -2 , grain morphology, and spike dry weight at anthesis. To clarify the roles of Q in agronomic trait performance, a functional marker for the Q gene was developed. Analysis of allelic effects showed that the bread wheat Q allele conferred free-threshing habit, soft glumes, and short and compact spikes compared with q. In addition, the Q allele contributed to higher grain yield, more grainsÂ m -2 , and higher thousand grain weight, whereas q contributed to more grains per spike/spikelet likely resulting from increased preanthesis spike growth. For grain morphology, the Q allele was associated with reduced ratio of grain length to height, indicating a rounder grain. These results are supported by analysis of four Q mutant lines in the Chinese Spring background. Therefore, the transition from q to Q during wheat domestication had profound effects on grain yield and grain shape evolution as well, being a consequence of pleiotropy."

"28786221","abstracttext","Abiotic stresses such as salt and drought represent adverse environmental conditions that significantly damage plant growth and agricultural productivity. In this study, the mechanism of the plant growth-promoting rhizo-bacteria (PGPR)-stimulated tolerance against abiotic stresses has been explored. Results suggest that PGPR strains, Arthrobacter protophormiae (SA3) and Dietzia natronolimnaea (STR1), can facilitate salt stress tolerance in wheat crop, while Bacillus subtilis (LDR2) can provide tolerance against drought stress in wheat. These PGPR strains enhance photosynthetic efficiency under salt and drought stress conditions. Moreover, all three PGPR strains increase indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) content of wheat under salt and drought stress conditions. The SA3 and LDR2 inoculations counteracted the increase of abscisic acid (ABA) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) under both salt and drought stress conditions, whereas STR1 had no significant impact on the ABA and ACC content. The impact of PGPR inoculations on these physiological parameters were further confirmed by gene expression analysis as we observed enhanced levels of the TaCTR1 gene in SA3-, STR1- and LDR2-treated wheat seedlings as compared to uninoculated drought and salt stressed plants. PGPR inoculations enhanced expression of TaDREB2 gene encoding for a transcription factor, which has been shown to be important for improving the tolerance of plants to abiotic stress conditions. Our study suggest that PGPR confer abiotic stress tolerance in wheat by enhancing IAA content, reducing ABA/ACC content, modulating expression of a regulatory component (CTR1) of ethylene signaling pathway and DREB2 transcription factor."

"32249292","abstracttext","Rhopalosiphum padi L. is one of the predominant aphids affecting wheat crops worldwide. Therefore, the identification of resistant genotypes and the understanding of molecular response mechanisms involved in wheat resistance to this aphid may contribute to the development of new breeding strategies. In this study, we evaluated the resistance of 15 wheat cultivars to R. padi and performed morpho-histological and gene expression analyses of two wheat cultivars (BRS TimbaÃºva, resistant and Embrapa 16, susceptible) challenged and unchallenged by R. padi. The main findings of our work are as follows: 1) most Brazilian wheat cultivars recently released are resistant to R. padi; 2) Green leaf volatiles are probably involved in the resistance of the BRS TimbaÃºva cultivar to the aphid; 3) trichomes were more abundant and larger in the resistant cultivar; 4) the internal morphology did not show differences between cultivars; 5) the lipoxygenase-encoding gene was downregulated in the susceptible cultivar and basal expression remained level in the resistant cultivar; and 6) the expression of resistance-related proteins was induced in the resistant but not in the susceptible cultivar. Lipoxygenase is the first enzyme in the octadecanoic pathway, a well-known route for the synthesis of signaling molecules involved in the activation of plant defense. The overall analyses suggest that the key steps in BRS TimbaÃºva resistance to R. padi may be presence or absence of green leaf volatiles decreasing the aphid preference and the action of nonglandular trichome as a physical barrier, which allows continuous lipoxygenase-encoding gene expression."

These assemblies form the basis to compare the dynamics of wheat genomes on a megabase scale."
"30115097","abstracttext_results","Here, we provide a comparative sequence analysis of the 700-megabase chromosome 2D between two bread wheat genotypes-the old landrace Chinese Spring and the elite Swiss spring wheat line 'CH Campala Lr22a'. Both chromosomes were assembled into megabase-sized scaffolds. There is a high degree of sequence conservation between the two chromosomes. Analysis of large structural variations reveals four large indels of more than 100Â kb. Based on the molecular signatures at the breakpoints, unequal crossing over and double-strand break repair were identified as the molecular mechanisms that caused these indels. Three of the large indels affect copy number of NLRs, a gene family involved in plant immunity. Analysis of SNP density reveals four haploblocks of 4, 8, 9 and 48Â Mb with a 35-fold increased SNP density compared to the rest of the chromosome. Gene content across the two chromosomes was highly conserved. Ninety-nine percent of the genic sequences were present in both genotypes and the fraction of unique genes ranged from 0.4 to 0.7%."

"30128601","articletitle","Fine mapping of powdery mildew resistance gene Pm4e in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)."
"30128601","abstracttext_main conclusion","Fine mapping of wheat powdery mildew-resistance gene Pm4e to a 0.19Â cM interval with sequence-based markers provides the foundation for map-based cloning and marker-assisted selection with breeder-friendly markers. Powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici is a wheat foliar disease that poses a serious threat to global wheat production. Pm4 is a resistance gene locus that has played a key role in controlling this disease in wheat production and a few resistance alleles of this locus have been identified. We have previously mapped the Pm4e allele to a 6.7Â cM interval on chromosome 2AL. In this study, Pm4e was delimited to a 0.19Â cM interval flanked by Xwgrc763 and Xwgrc865, through employment of a larger segregating population, derived from the cross of resistant parent D29 with susceptible parent Yangmai 158 (Y158), and enrichment of the genetic interval with markers developed on Chinese Spring (C.S.) survey sequence. In this interval, Pm4e co-segregated with a few markers, some of which were either D29-dominant or Y158-dominant, implying great sequence variation in the interval between D29 and Y158. Most of these co-segregation markers could not differentiate the Pm4 alleles from each other. Survey of 55 wheat cultivars with four co-dominant markers showed that the Pm4e-co-segregating loci always co-exist. Annotation of the Pm4e interval-corresponding C.S. sequence revealed more than a dozen resistance gene analogs clustered in a 2.4Â Mb region, although C.S. is susceptible to the Pm4e-avirulent isolate Bgt2. This study has established the foundation for map-based cloning of Pm4e. Moreover, some of the co-dominant markers developed in this study could help in marker-assisted transfer of Pm4e into elite cultivars."

Phylogenetic and syntenic analyses revealed tandem gene duplication and chromosomal rearrangement leading to separation of Amy1 into two distinct loci, Amy1Î¸ and Amy1Î». The divergence of Amy1Î» from Amy1Î¸ was driven by adaptive selection pressures performed on two amino acids, Arg 97 and Asn 233 (Pâ>â0.95*). The predicted protein structural alteration caused by substitution of Asp 233 Asn in the conserved starch binding surface site, and significantly expressional differentiation during seed germination and grain development provided evidence of functional divergence between Amy1Î¸ and Amy1Î» genes. We screened out candidate copies (TaAmy1-A1/A2 and TaAmy1-D1) associated with high residual Î±-amylase activities in ripe grains.

"31494715","abstracttext","The Ph1 gene is the principal regulator of homoeologous chromosome pairing control (HECP) that ensures the diploid-like meiotic chromosome pairing behavior of polyploid wheat. The HECP control was speculated to have evolved after the first event of polyploidization. With the objective to accurately understand the evolution of the HECP control, wild emmer wheat accessions previously known to differ for HECP control were characterized for the structure and expression of the candidateÂ Ph1 gene, C-Ph1. The C-TdPh1-5A and 5B gene copies of emmer wheat showed 98 and 99% DNA sequence similarity respectively with the corresponding hexaploid wheat copies. Further, the C-TdPh1-5B carried the C-Ph1-5B specific structural changes and transcribed three splice variants as observed in the hexaploid wheat. Further, single nucleotide changes differentiating accessions varying for HECP control were identified. Analyzed by quantitative expression analysis, the wild emmer accessions with HECP control showed ~â10,000-fold higher transcript abundance of the C-TdPh1-5B copy during prophase-I compared to accessions lacking the control. Differential transcriptional regulation of C-TdPh1-5B splice variants further revealed that C-Ph1-5B alt1 variant is mainly responsible for differential accumulation of C-Ph1-5B copy in accessions with HECP control. Taken together, these results showed that the HECP control evolved via transcriptional regulation of splice variants during meiosis."

"33214978","abstracttext","Terminal heat stress (HS) is a key barrier for wheat grain yield and quality. Various physiochemical and molecular parameters such as photosynthetic rate, expression analysis and activity of starch synthase (SS), total starch, amylose and amylopectin content, total amylolytic activity, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were analysed in wheat cvs. HD3059 (thermotolerant) and BT-Schomburgk (thermosusceptible) at grain-fillingÂ stage under HS (32Â Â°C and 40Â Â°C, 1Â h). The decrease in photosynthetic rate was observed under HS. Expression analysis of the SS gene at transcript level showed downregulation in both the wheat cvs. HD3059 and BT-Schombugk under HS (32Â Â°C and 40Â ÂºC, 1Â h) as compared to the control. Although the downregulation of SS gene transcript expression was less in HD3059 than BT-Schombugk. Both the cultivars showed decrease in starch synthase activity and starch content under HS and the overall content was higher in HD3059, compared to BT-Schomburgk. Higher total amylolytic activity and amylose content were observed in BT-Schomburgk. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed un-structured starch granules under HS. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was found higher in HD3059 (14.07Â mM FeSO 4 gm -1 FW) compared to BT-Schomburgk (8.89Â mM FeSO 4 gm -1 FW) under HS (40Â ÂºC, 1Â h). Findings suggest that HS during grain filling stage had more severe impact on the overall physiochemical properties of the wheat grain. Thus the starch bisynthesis pathway associated gene(s) could be exploit to enhance the yield and quality of wheat under heat stress."

The brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens, BPH) and the small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus, SBPH) are the most destructive insect pests within the family Delphacidae. These two species differ in their host range (SBPH can well colonize rice and wheat plants, whereas BPH survives on only rice plants), but the underlying mechanism of this difference remains unknown. High-throughput sequencing provides a powerful approach for analyzing the association between changes in gene expression and the physiological responses of insects. Therefore, gut transcriptomes were performed to elucidate the genes associated with host adaptation in planthoppers. The comparative analysis of planthopper responses to different diets will improve our knowledge of host adaptation regarding herbivorous insects."

The results showed that the majority of differentially expressed genes in SBPH showed similar changes in expression for short-term transfer and long-term colonization. Based on a comparative analysis of BPH and SBPH after transfer, the genes associated with sugar transporters and heat-shock proteins showed similar variation. However, most of the genes were differentially regulated between the two species. The detoxification-related genes were upregulated in SBPH after transfer from the rice plants to the wheat plants, but these genes were downregulated in BPH under the same conditions. In contrast, ribosomal-related genes were downregulated in SBPH after transfer, but these genes were upregulated in BPH under the same conditions."

"2557633","articletitle","A ubiquitin carrier protein from wheat germ is structurally and functionally similar to the yeast DNA repair enzyme encoded by RAD6."
"2557633","abstracttext","The RAD6 gene from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a ubiquitin carrier protein (E2) required for a variety of cellular processes including DNA repair, induced mutagenesis, and sporulation. Here we identify an E2 from a higher plant, wheat, that is similar to RAD6 with respect to both structure and in vitro substrate specificity. The protein was purified from wheat germ by a combination of ubiquitin covalent affinity chromatography and anion-exchange HPLC and has an apparent molecular mass of 23 kDa [referred to as E2(23 kDa)]. E2(23 kDa) was capable of binding ubiquitin by means of a thiol ester linkage in an ATP-dependent and ubiquitin-activating enzyme-dependent reaction. In the presence of a variety of target proteins, E2(23 kDa), like the RAD6 gene product, formed covalent ubiquitin-protein conjugates in vitro only with histones in a ubiquitin protein ligase-independent reaction. E2(23 kDa) recognized both core and linker histones with an apparent order of preference of H2A greater than or equal to H1 greater than H2B greater than H3 greater than H4. This E2 protein was approximately 17-fold more effective at conjugating ubiquitin to histones than three other purified wheat germ E2 proteins tested. Mouse anti-E2(23 kDa) antibodies were used to isolate E2(23 kDa) DNA sequences from a wheat cDNA expression library. Antibody-positive clones were confirmed by amino acid identity of the sequence deduced from the cDNA to the peptide sequence of an E2(23 kDa) tryptic fragment. Protein expressed in Escherichia coli by the E2(23 kDa) cDNA was capable of both thiol ester adduct formation and conjugation of ubiquitin to histones. Analysis of the E2(23 kDa) cDNA shows that it encodes a protein with considerable amino acid sequence similarity to the yeast RAD6 gene product. Similarities exist at the amino terminus, the region surrounding the putative ubiquitin binding site, and at the carboxyl terminus, which is unusually acidic. Based on both the structural and enzymatic similarities to the RAD6 gene product, E2(23 kDa) may represent the first DNA repair enzyme identified in higher plants."

"6175930","abstracttext","The specific mRNA of myelin basic protein (MBP) was isolated from active myelinating rat brains. The isolated mRNA was able to direct the synthesis of immunochemically detectable MBP in a wheat-germ cell free protein synthesis system. There was, however, no evidence of neuronal translational control of the in vitro MBP synthesis kinetics found within the experimental parameters. The possibility of neuronal control of MBP gene expression is therefore postulated likely to be at the transcriptional level."

The distribution of the HRP-labeled fibers was similar to that of nerves immunoreactive to substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide, which were partly colocalized. The results show that the thymus is innervated by primary sensory afferents which have their cell bodies in dorsal root ganglia."

"12081374","abstracttext","Expression of granule-bound starch synthase 1 (GBSS1) in wheat is restricted to the grain filling process. In order to identify promoter regions which are involved in transcriptional control of the observed expression pattern, we isolated about 8 kb of a wheat gbss1-upstream region. Within this sequence several putative cis-acting elements were identified. In addition, an untranslated leader region is located in the 5' region of the gbss1 gene. To investigate promoter activity of the isolated region, the proximal 4.0 kb and progressively 5'-deleted fragments were transcriptionally fused to a beta-glucuronidase reporter gene. The function of the promoter constructs was tested by transient expression assays in various wheat tissues and in transgenic wheat plants, which were selected for low number and integrity of transgene copies. Analysis of stable transformants revealed that the -4.0 kb promoter region mediates reporter gene expression that is in accordance with the endogenous gbss1 expression. Promoter deletion to -1.9 kb or to -1.0 kb did not change the expression profile with regard to grain and pollen specificity. However, the profile of beta-glucuronidase expression during the grain filling process is altered in such a way that the level of beta-glucuronidase activity declines due to the decreasing promoter length. It is proposed that enhancer elements and cis-acting elements, which are involved in gbss1 transcription during the grain filling process, are located -1.9 kb upstream of the promoter. In addition, participation of the untranslated leader region in tissue-specific gene expression is discussed."

"14595557","abstracttext","Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are useful markers for gene diagnosis and mapping of genes on chromosomes. However, polyploidy, which is characteristic of the evolution of higher plants, complicates the analysis of SNPs in the duplicated genes. We have developed a new method for SNP analysis in hexaploid wheat. First, we classified a large number of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from wheat in silico. Those grouped into contigs were anticipated to correspond to transcripts from homoeologous loci. We then selected relatively abundant ESTs, and assigned these contigs to each of the homoeologous chromosomes using a nullisomic/tetrasomic series of Chinese Spring wheat strains in combination with pyrosequencing. The ninety genes assigned were almost evenly distributed into seven homologous chromosomes. We then created a virtual display of the relative expression of these genes. Expression patterns of genes from the three genomes in hexaploid wheat were classified into two major groups: (1) genes almost equally expressed from all three genomes; and (2) genes expressed with a significant preference, which changed from tissue to tissue, from certain genomes. In 11 cases, one of the three genes in the allopolyploid was found to be silenced. No preference for gene-silencing in particular genomes or chromosomes was observed, suggesting that gene-silencing occurred after polyploidization, and at the gene level, not at the chromosome or genome level. Thus, the use of this SNP method to distinguish the expression profiles of three homoeologous genes may help to elucidate the molecular basis of heterosis in polyploid plants."

"17388792","articletitle","Identifying regions of the wheat genome controlling seed development by mapping expression quantitative trait loci."
"17388792","abstracttext","Statistical methods established for the genetic analysis of quantitative traits can be applied to gene expression data. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis can associate the expression of genes or groups of genes with particular genomic regions, and thereby identify regions regulating gene expression. A segregating population of 41 doubled haploid (DH) lines from the hard red spring wheat cross RL4452 x 'AC Domain' was used to map expression level polymorphisms. This population had previously been mapped with microsatellites, and includes a full QTL analysis for agronomic and seed quality traits. Expression analysis on mRNA from developing seed grown in two field locations was conducted on 39 of the 41 DH lines using the Affymetrix GeneChip Wheat Genome Array. Analysis of the hybridization intensity identified 1484 Affymetrix probe sets in the first location and 10,280 probe sets in the second location, where the hybridization intensity varied significantly between genotypes of the population. A common set of 1455 probe sets differing in intensity between genotypes in both locations was used for mapping, and 542 QTLs were identified that each mapped to a single chromosome interval, illustrating that major gene expression QTLs could be found in wheat. Genomic regions corresponding to multiple gene expression QTLs were identified. Comparison of expression mapping data with physical mapping of wheat expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences using rice synteny, as well as logarithm of odds (LOD) score analysis, showed that both cis- and trans-acting expression QTLs were present. Chromosomes 1D and 4B may contain significant trans-regulatory regions in this population."

"19922697","articletitle","Efficient mapping of a female sterile gene in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)."
"19922697","abstracttext","Studies on inheritance of fertility are of great importance in wheat breeding. Although substantial progress has been achieved in molecular characterization of male sterility and fertility restoration recently, little effort has been devoted to female sterility. To identify the gene(s) controlling female sterility in wheat efficiently, an investigation was conducted for the seed setting ratio using a set of F2 populations derived from the cross between a female sterile line XND126 and an elite cultivar Gaocheng 8901. Bulked segregation analysis (BSA) method and recessive class approach were adopted to screen for SSR markers potentially linked to female fertility gene loci in 2005. Out of 1080 SSRs in wheat genome, eight markers on chromosome 2D showed a clear difference between two disparate bulks and small recombination frequency values, suggesting a strong linkage signal to the sterility gene. Based on the candidate linked markers, partial linkage maps were constructed with Mapmaker 3.0 (EXP) instead of whole genome maps, and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping was implemented with software QTLNetwork 2.0. A major gene locus designated as taf1, was located on chromosome 2DS. The above result was confirmed by the analysis for 2007 data, and taf1 was identified on the same chromosome 2DS with a confidence interval of 2.4 cM, which could explain 44.99% of phenotypic variation. These results provided fundamental information for fine mapping studies and laid the groundwork for wheat fertility genetic studies."

"19352751","articletitle","RFLP mapping of resistance to chlorosis induction by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis in wheat."
"19352751","abstracttext","Tan spot, caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, is an economically important disease in major wheat production areas. The fungus can produce two genetically distinct symptoms on leaves of susceptible wheat genotypes: tan necrosis (nec) and extensive chlorosis (ch1). Our objectives were to determine the number of genes conditioning resistance to tan spot in a population of wheat recombinant inbred lines, and map the chromosomal location of the resistance genes using RFLPs. Conidia produced by the P. tritici-repentis isolate Pti2 (nee + chl +) were used to inoculate seedlings of 135 recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross of the synthetic hexaploid wheat W-7984 with Opata 85. A subset of the population was inoculated with conidia produced by the isolates D308 (nec - chl +) and 86-124 (nec + chl-). Inoculated seedlings were rated on a scale of 1 to 5 based on lesion type. Necrosis-inducing culture filtrate produced by the isolate 86-124 was also used to screen the entire population. A map consisting of 532 markers was employed to identify significant associations between marker loci and tan spot resistance. The entire population was insensitive to culture filtrate produced by the isolate 86-124, and the entire subset was resistant to conidial inoculation of the same isolate. The population segregated for reaction to isolates D308 and Pti2, indicating that this population segregates for resistance to extensive chlorosis only, and not to tan necrosis. RFLP analysis indicated the presence of a gene with a major effect in 1AS, a gene with a minor effect in 4AL, and an interaction between the 1AS gene and a gene in 2DL. Together, these loci explained 49.0% of the variation in this population for resistance to tan spot produced by the isolate Pti2. Two regions one in 1BL and one in 3BL, were significantly associated with resistance to extensive chlorosis, but were not significant in the multiple regression model. It should be feasible to introgress these resistance loci into adapted genetic backgrounds by using a marker-assisted selection scheme."

"21508323","articletitle","Serine/threonine kinase gene Stpk-V, a key member of powdery mildew resistance gene Pm21, confers powdery mildew resistance in wheat."
"21508323","abstracttext","Powdery mildew resistance gene Pm21, located on the chromosome 6V short arm of Haynaldia villosa and transferred to wheat as a 6VSÂ·6AL translocation (T6VSÂ·6AL), confers durable and broad-spectrum resistance to wheat powdery mildew. Pm21 has become a key gene resource for powdery mildew resistance breeding all over the world. In China, 12 wheat varieties containing Pm21 have been planted on more than 3.4 million hectares since 2002. Pm21 has been intractable to molecular genetic mapping because the 6VS does not pair and recombine with the 6AS. Moreover, all known accessions of H. villosa are immune to powdery mildew fungus. Pm21 is still defined by cytogenetics as a locus. In the present study, a putative serine and threonine protein kinase gene Stpk-V was cloned and characterized with an integrative strategy of molecular and cytogenetic techniques. Stpk-V is located on the Pm21 locus. The results of a single cell transient expression assay showed that Stpk-V could decrease the haustorium index dramatically. After the Stpk-V was transformed into a susceptible wheat variety Yangmai158, the characterized transgenic plants showed high and broad-spectrum powdery mildew resistance similar to T6VSÂ·6AL. Silencing of the Stpk-V by virus-induced gene silencing in both T6VSÂ·6AL and H. villosa resulted in their increased susceptibility. Stpk-V could be induced by Bgt and exogenous H(2)O(2), but it also mediated the increase of endogenous H(2)O(2), leading to cell death and plant resistance when the plant was attacked by Bgt."

Two populations from the crosses TA5599 (T5DL-5M(g)LÂ·5M(g)S)/TA3809 (ph1b mutant in Chinese Spring background) and TA5599/Lakin were developed and used for genetic mapping to identify markers linked to the resistance gene. Further molecular and cytogenetic characterization resulted in the identification of nine spontaneous recombinants with shortened Ae. geniculata segments. Three of the wheat-Ae. geniculata recombinants (U6154-124, U6154-128, and U6200-113) are interstitial translocations (T5DSÂ·5DL-5M(g)L-5DL), with 20-30% proximal segments of 5M(g)L translocated to 5DL; the other six are recombinants (T5DL-5M(g)LÂ·5M(g)S) have shortened segments of 5M(g)L with fraction lengths (FL) of 0.32-0.45 compared with FL 0.55 for the 5M(g)L segment in the original translocation donor, TA5599. Recombinants U6200-64, U6200-117, and U6154-124 carry the stem rust resistance gene Sr53 with the same infection type as TA5599, the resistance gene donor. All recombinants were confirmed to be genetically compensating on the basis of genomic in situ hybridization and molecular marker analysis with chromosome 5D- and 5M(g)-specific SSR/STS-PCR markers. These recombinants between wheat and Ae. geniculata will provide another source for wheat stem rust resistance breeding and for physical mapping of the resistance locus and crossover hot spots between wheat chromosome 5D and chromosome 5M(g)L of Ae. geniculata."

The relative frequency of these SNPs was examined by RNAseq in two bulked samples made up of homozygous recombinant lines differing for their GPC phenotype. SNPs that were enriched at least 3-fold in the corresponding pool (6.5% of all SNPs) were further evaluated.

Additionally, the ability to specifically develop homozygous lines carrying a unique insertion event could be important in avoiding gene silencing due to co-suppression, and if needed assist in the selection of lines suitable for future deregulation. The same primer pairs can be used to quantify many different wheat transgenic events because the construct-specific primer pairs are targeted to standard sequence elements of the cereal gene cassettes, making the method widely applicable in wheat GM research. Moreover, because all procedures described here are standardized, the method may easily be adapted to vectors lacking the target regions used here and/or to other plant models."

"27175509","abstracttext","Lesion mimics (LMs) that exhibit spontaneous disease-like lesions in the absence of pathogen attack might confer enhanced plant disease resistance to a wide range of pathogens. The LM mutant, lm3 was derived from a single naturally mutated individual in the F1 population of a 3-1/Jing411 cross, backcrossed six times with 3-1 as the recurrent parent and subsequently self-pollinated twice. The leaves of young seedlings of the lm3 mutant exhibited small, discrete white lesions under natural field conditions. The lesions first appeared at the leaf tips and subsequently expanded throughout the entire leaf blade to the leaf sheath. The lesions were initiated through light intensity and day length. Histochemical staining revealed that lesion formation might reflect programmed cell death (PCD) and abnormal accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The chlorophyll content in the mutant was significantly lower than that in wildtype, and the ratio of chlorophyll a/b was increased significantly in the mutant compared with wildtype, indicating that lm3 showed impairment of the biosynthesis or degradation of chlorophyll, and that Chlorophyll b was prone to damage during lesion formation. The lm3 mutant exhibited enhanced resistance to wheat powdery mildew fungus (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici; Bgt) infection, which was consistent with the increased expression of seven pathogenesis-related (PR) and two wheat chemically induced (WCI) genes involved in the defense-related reaction. Genetic analysis showed that the mutation was controlled through a single partially dominant gene, which was closely linked to Xbarc203 on chromosome 3BL; this gene was delimited to a 40 Mb region between SSR3B450.37 and SSR3B492.6 using a large derived segregating population and the available Chinese Spring chromosome 3B genome sequence. Taken together, our results provide information regarding the identification of a novel wheat LM gene, which will facilitate the additional fine-mapping and cloning of the gene to understand the mechanism underlying LM initiation and disease resistance in common wheat."

"27943461","abstracttext","The ability to edit plant genomes through gene targeting (GT) requires efficient methods to deliver both sequence-specific nucleases (SSNs) and repair templates to plant cells. This is typically achieved using Agrobacterium T-DNA, biolistics or by stably integrating nuclease-encoding cassettes and repair templates into the plant genome. In dicotyledonous plants, such as Nicotinana tabacum (tobacco) and Solanum lycopersicum (tomato), greater than 10-fold enhancements in GT frequencies have been achieved using DNA virus-based replicons. These replicons transiently amplify to high copy numbers in plant cells to deliver abundant SSNs and repair templates to achieve targeted gene modification. In the present work, we developed a replicon-based system for genome engineering of cereal crops using a deconstructed version of the wheat dwarf virus (WDV). In wheat cells, the replicons achieve a 110-fold increase in expression of a reporter gene relative to non-replicating controls. Furthermore, replicons carrying CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases and repair templates achieved GT at an endogenous ubiquitin locus at frequencies 12-fold greater than non-viral delivery methods. The use of a strong promoter to express Cas9 was critical to attain these high GT frequencies. We also demonstrate gene-targeted integration by homologous recombination (HR) in all three of the homoeoalleles (A, B and D) of the hexaploid wheat genome, and we show that with the WDV replicons, multiplexed GT within the same wheat cell can be achieved at frequencies of ~1%. In conclusion, high frequencies of GT using WDV-based DNA replicons will make it possible to edit complex cereal genomes without the need to integrate GT reagents into the genome."

"29037165","abstracttext_background","Haynaldia villosa (H. villosa) has been recognized as a species potentially useful for wheat improvement. The availability of its genomic sequences will boost its research and application."
"29037165","abstracttext_results","In this work, the short arm of H. villosa chromosome 4V (4VS) was sorted by flow cytometry and sequenced using Illumina platform. About 170.6Â Mb assembled sequences were obtained. Further analysis showed that repetitive elements accounted for about 64.6% of 4VS, while the coding fraction, which is corresponding to 1977 annotated genes, represented 1.5% of the arm. The syntenic regions of the 4VS were searched and identified on wheat group 4 chromosomes 4AL, 4BS, 4DS, Brachypodium chromosomes 1 and 4, rice chromosomes 3 and 11, and sorghum chromosomes 1, 5 and 8. Based on genome-zipper analysis, a virtual gene order comprising 735 gene loci on 4VS genome was built by referring to the Brachypodium genome, which was relatively consistent with the scaffold order determined for Ae. tauschii chromosome 4D. The homologous alleles of several cloned genes on wheat group 4 chromosomes including Rht-1 gene were identified."
"29037165","abstracttext_conclusions","The sequences provided valuable information for mapping and positional-cloning genes located on 4VS, such as the wheat yellow mosaic virus resistance gene Wss1. The work on 4VS provided detailed insights into the genome of H. villosa, and may also serve as a model for sequencing the remaining parts of H. villosa genome."

"28856652","abstracttext","One of the most important tools to identify and validate rust resistance gene function is by producing loss-of-function mutants. Mutants can be produced using irradiation, chemicals, and insertions. Among all the mutagens, ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and sodium azide are most favored because of the ease of use and generation of random point mutations in the genome. The mutants so produced facilitate the isolation, identification and cloning of rust resistance genes. In this chapter we describe a protocol for seed mutagenesis of wheat with EMS and sodium azide."

"30136108","abstracttext_key message","CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing and EMS mutagenesis revealed inter-cultivar differences and additivity in the contribution of TaGW2 homoeologues to grain size and weight in wheat. The TaGW2 gene homoeologues have been reported to be negative regulators of grain size (GS) and thousand grain weight (TGW) in wheat. However, the contribution of each homoeologue to trait variation among different wheat cultivars is not well documented. We used the CRISPR-Cas9 system and TILLING to mutagenize each homoeologous gene copy in cultivars Bobwhite and Paragon, respectively. Plants carrying single-copy nonsense mutations in different genomes showed different levels of GS/TGW increase, with TGW increasing by an average of 5.5% (edited lines) and 5.3% (TILLING mutants). In any combination, the double homoeologue mutants showed higher phenotypic effects than the respective single-genome mutants. The double mutants had on average 12.1% (edited) and 10.5% (TILLING) higher TGW with respect to wild-type lines. The highest increase in GS and TGW was shown for triple mutants of both cultivars, with increases in 16.3% (edited) and 20.7% (TILLING) in TGW. The additive effects of the TaGW2 homoeologues were also demonstrated by the negative correlation between the functional gene copy number and GS/TGW in Bobwhite mutants and an F 2 population. The highest single-genome increases in GS and TGW in Paragon and Bobwhite were obtained by mutations in the B and D genomes, respectively. These inter-cultivar differences in the phenotypic effects between the TaGW2 gene homoeologues coincide with inter-cultivar differences in the homoeologue expression levels. These results indicate that GS/TGW variation in wheat can be modulated by the dosage of homoeologous genes with inter-cultivar differences in the magnitude of the individual homoeologue effects."

"30715311","abstracttext_background","Whole-genome shotgun resequencing of wheat is expensive because of its large, repetitive genome. Moreover, sequence data can fail to map uniquely to the reference genome, making it difficult to unambiguously assign variation. Resequencing using target capture enables sequencing of large numbers of individuals at high coverage to reliably identify variants associated with important agronomic traits. Previous studies have implemented complementary DNA/exon or gene-based probe sets in which the promoter and intron sequence is largely missing alongside newly characterized genes from the recent improved reference sequences."

We applied these prediction models to determine on-target specificity and potential off-target activity for individual gRNAs targeting specific loci in the wheat genome.

"31514396","abstracttext","Puccinia triticina ( Pt ), the causal agent of wheat leaf rust, is one of the most destructive fungal pathogens threatening global wheat cultivations. The rational utilization of leaf rust resistance ( Lr ) genes is still the most efficient method for the control of such diseases. The Lr47 gene introgressed from chromosome 7S of Aegilops speltoides still showed high resistance to the majority of Pt races collected in China. However, the Lr47 gene has not been cloned yet, and the regulatory network of the Lr47 -mediated resistance has not been explored. In the present investigation, transcriptome analysis was applied on RNA samples from three different wheat lines (""Yecora Rojo"", ""UC1037"", and ""White Yecora"") carrying the Lr47 gene three days post-inoculation with the epidemic Pt race THTT. A comparison between Pt -inoculated and water-inoculated "" Lr47 -Yecora Rojo"" lines revealed a total number of 863 upregulated ( q -value < 0.05 and log2foldchange > 1) and 418 downregulated ( q -value < 0.05 and log2foldchange < -1) genes. Specifically, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) located on chromosomes 7AS, 7BS, and 7DS were identified, ten of which encoded receptor-like kinases (RLKs). The expression patterns of these RLK genes were further determined by a time-scale qRT-PCR assay. Moreover, heatmaps for the expression profiles of pathogenesis-related ( PR ) genes and several transcription factor gene families were generated. Using a transcriptomic approach, we initially profiled the transcriptional changes associated with the Lr47 -mediated resistance. The identified DEGs, particularly those genes encoding RLKs, might serve as valuable genetic resources for the improvement of wheat resistance to Pt ."

"33053501","abstracttext","C3H zinc finger transcription factors play important roles in managing various biotic/abiotic stresses in Aarabidopsis, rice, and maize. The functions of these factors in wheat, however, remain largely unclear. We identified 88 TaC3H genes that were divided into four subfamilies in this analysis. Gene structure and conserved domain analyses indicate that most members of the same subfamily have similar structures. A total of 76 paralogous and 48 orthologous pairs were identified and Ka/Ks values were used to analyze replication relationships amongst wheat, rice, and Arabidopsis. Gene ontology (GO) annotation analysis showed that most TaC3H genes possessed molecular functions, while transcriptome results showed that the 88 TaC3H genes responded to water imbibition. Microarray data for 53 TaC3H genes were obtained and heat maps were generated; these results indicate that these genes are expressed in 13 wheat tissues. Subcellular localization prediction analysis indicates that most TaC3H genes are located in the nucleus. Promoter analysis indicates that most TaC3H genes contained cis-elements including ABRE, GARE-motif, and MBS, indicating that these can respond to various biotic/abiotic stresses. Transcriptome data and quantitative real-time PCR analysis of wheat cultivars with contrasting seed dormancy phenotypes show that five genes TaC3H4/-18/-37/-51/-72 were very likely involved in seed dormancy and germination. Exogenous ABA treatment further indicated that these five genes were responsive to ABA, suggesting that there may be a crosstalk between these genes and ABA signaling pathway in controlling seed dormancy and germination. These results provide a theoretical basis for subsequent studies on TaC3H gene function and also contribute to studies on the C3H gene in other species."

"33245431","abstracttext","NAC (NAM, AFAT1/2, and CUC2) transcription factors play important roles in plant growth and in resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. Here, we show that the TaNAC35 gene negatively regulates leaf rust resistance in the wheat line Thatcherâ+âLr14b (TcLr14b) when challenged with a virulent isolate of Puccinia triticina (Pt). The TaNAC35 gene was cloned from this line, and blastp results showed that its open reading frame (ORF) was 96.16% identical to the NAC35-like sequence reported from Aegilops tauschii, and that it encoded a protein with 387 amino acids (aa) including a conserved NAM domain with 145Â aa at the N-terminal alongside the transcriptional activation domain with 220Â aa in the C-terminal. Yeast-one-hybrid analysis proved that the C-terminal of the TaNAC35 protein was responsible for transcriptional activation. A 250-bp fragment from the 3'-end of this target gene was introduced to a BSMV-VIGS vector and used to infect the wheat line Thatcherâ+âLr14b (TcLr14b). The BSMV-VIGS/TaNAC35-infected plant material showed enhanced resistance (infection type ""1"") to Pt pathotype THTT, which was fully virulent (infection type ""4"") on BSMV-VIGS only infected TcLr14b plants. Histological studies showed that inhibition of TaNAC35 reduced the formation of haustorial mother cells (HMC) and mycelial growth, implying that the TaNAC35 gene plays a negative role in the response of TcLr14b to Pt pathotype THTT. These results provide molecular insight into the interaction between Pt and its wheat host, and identify a potential target for engineering resistance in wheat to this damaging pathogen."

Iodoacetamide-inactivated protoplasts of maize were fused with trititrigia protoplasts, which were sensitive to the PEG/DMSO fusion treatment at high pH and high calcium. Based on physiological complementation, approximately 0.002% of the total protoplasts cultured following fusion treatment developed into cell colonies, and 79 lines of them, almost a half, were singled out and subcultured. Among the subcultured lines three were, in comparison with the parents, identified as somatic hybrids by their coupled XbaI restriction patterns of total DNAs probed with the ribosomal DNA of rice. Southern analysis of the digested total DNAs with a mitochondrial gene, atpA., from pea, or a chloroplast gene, trnK, from rice, revealed that all the hybrids carried only the organellar DNAs of trititrigia, which excluded the possibilities of a chimeric callus or any DNA contamination. Cytogenetically, one hybrid was mixoploid with a 2n of 46-67 in which chromosomal endoreduplication, characterized by the appearance of diplochromosomes, was occasionally observed. Its hybridity was reconfirmed by the fact that it bore the satellite chromosomes of both maize and trititrigia, which were distinguishable from each other by size. In contrast, the other two hybrids were aneuploids. The potential of gene transfer between Zea and Triticum species was thus conclusively established."

Post-feeding rhodamine- or TRITC-tagged dietary lectins, the lectins were tracked from gut to dopaminergic neurons (DAergic-N) in transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) [egIs1(Pdat-1:GFP)] where the mutant has the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene fused to a dopamine transport protein gene labeling DAergic-N. The lectins were supplemented along with the food organism Escherichia coli (OP50). Among nine tested rhodamine/TRITC-tagged lectins, four, including Phaseolus vulgaris erythroagglutinin (PHA-E), Bandeiraea simplicifolia (BS-I), Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA), and Arachis hypogaea agglutinin (PNA), appeared to be transported from gut to the GFP-DAergic-N. Griffonia Simplicifolia and PHA-E, reduced the number of GFP-DAergic-N, suggesting a toxic activity. PHA-E, BS-I, Pisum sativum (PSA), and Triticum vulgaris agglutinin (Succinylated) reduced fluorescent intensity of GFP-DAergic-N. PHA-E, PSA, Concanavalin A, and Triticum vulgaris agglutinin decreased the size of GFP-DAergic-N, while BS-I increased neuron size. These observations suggest that dietary plant lectins are transported to and affect DAergic-N in C. elegans, which support Braak and Hawkes' hypothesis, suggesting one alternate potential dietary etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). A recent Danish study showed that vagotomy resulted in 40% lower incidence of PD over 20âyears. Differences in inherited sugar structures of gut and neuronal cell surfaces may make some individuals more susceptible in this conceptual disease etiology model."

"28577236","abstracttext_key message","Triticum durum Glutathione S-transferase Z1 is specifically responsive to glyphosate. Its expression influences the receptor-mediated vacuolar sorting mechanisms involved in tolerance mechanisms. A zeta subfamily glutathione S-transferase gene from Triticum durum (cv Cappelli) (TdGSTZ1) was characterized as part of a complex detoxification mechanism. The effect of different abiotic stresses on TdGSTZ1 revealed that the gene is unexpectedly responsive to glyphosate (GLY) herbicide despite it should not be part of tolerance mechanisms. Its role in the non-target-site mechanism of GLY resistance was then investigated. To analyze the GLY and the TdGSTZ1 overexpression effects on vacuolar sorting mechanisms, we performed transient transformation experiments in Nicotiana tabacum protoplasts using two vacuolar markers, AleuGFPgl133 and GFPgl133Chi, labeling the Sar1 dependent or independent sorting, respectively. We observed that the adaptive reaction of tobacco protoplasts vacuolar system to the treatment with GLY could be partially mimicked by the overexpression of TdGSTZ1 gene. To confirm the influence of GLY on the two vacuolar markers accumulation and the potential involvement of the secretion pathway activity in detoxification events, Arabidopsis thaliana transgenic plants overexpressing the non-glycosylated versions of the two markers were analyzed. The results suggested that GLY treatment specifically altered different vacuolar sorting characteristics, suggesting an involvement of the receptor-mediated AleuGFP sorting mechanism in GLY resistance. Finally, the expression analysis of selected genes confirmed that the non-target-site GLY resistance mechanisms are related to vacuolar sorting."

Sequence similarity analysis, based upon 363 sequenced 5S rDNA clones from 44 accessions plus 15 sequences retrieved from GenBank, depicted two unit classes labeled the long AE1 and short AE1. Several different analytical methods were applied to infer relationships within haplomes, between haplomes and among the species, including maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses of consensus sequences, ""total evidence"" phylogeny analysis and ""matrix representation with parsimony"" analysis. None were able to depict suites of markers or unit classes that could discern among the seven haplomes as is observed among established haplomes in other genera within the tribe Triticeae; however, most species could be separated when displayed on gene trees. These results suggest that the haplomes currently recognized are so refined that they may be relegated as sub-haplomes or haplome variants. Amblyopyrum shares the same 5S rDNA unit classes with the diploid Aegilops species suggesting that it belongs within the latter. Comparisons of the Aegilops sequences with those of Triticum showed that the long AE1 unit class of Ae. tauschii shared the clade with the equivalent long D1 unit class, i.e., the putative D haplome donor, but the short AE1 unit class did not. The long AE1 unit class but not the short, of Ae. speltoides and Ae. searsii both share the clade with the previously identified long {S1 and long G1 unit classes meaning that both Aegilops species can be equally considered putative B haplome donors to tetraploid Triticum species. The semiconserved nature of the nontranscribed spacer in Aegilops and in Triticeae in general is discussed in view that it may have originated by processes of incomplete gene conversion or biased gene conversion or birth-and-death evolution."

"20848270","abstracttext","The common wheat genotype 'RL6077' was believed to carry the gene Lr34/Yr18 that confers slow-rusting adult plant resistance (APR) to leaf rust and stripe rust but located to a different chromosome through inter-chromosomal reciprocal translocation. However, haplotyping using the cloned Lr34/Yr18 diagnostic marker and the complete sequencing of the gene indicated Lr34/Yr18 is absent in RL6077. We crossed RL6077 with the susceptible parent 'Avocet' and developed F(3), F(4) and F(6) populations from photoperiod-insensitive F(3) lines that were segregating for resistance to leaf rust and stripe rust. The populations were characterized for leaf rust resistance at two Mexican sites, Cd. Obregon during the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 crop seasons, and El Batan during 2009, and for stripe rust resistance at Toluca, a third Mexican site, during 2009. The F(3) population was also evaluated for stripe rust resistance at Cobbitty, Australia, during 2009. Most lines had correlated responses to leaf rust and stripe rust, indicating that either the same gene, or closely linked genes, confers resistance to both diseases. Molecular mapping using microsatellites led to the identification of five markers (Xgwm165, Xgwm192, Xcfd71, Xbarc98 and Xcfd23) on chromosome 4DL that are associated with this gene(s), with the closest markers being located at 0.4 cM. In a parallel study in Canada using a Thatcher Ã RL6077 F(3) population, the same leaf rust resistance gene was designated as Lr67 and mapped to the same chromosomal region. The pleiotropic, or closely linked, gene derived from RL6077 that conferred stripe rust resistance in this study was designated as Yr46. The slow-rusting gene(s) Lr67/Yr46 can be utilized in combination with other slow-rusting genes to develop high levels of durable APR to leaf rust and stripe rust in wheat."
"27050567","articletitle","Molecular Mapping of Stripe Rust Resistance Gene Yr76 in Winter Club Wheat Cultivar Tyee."
"27050567","abstracttext","Tyee, one of the wheat cultivars used to differentiate races of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici in the United States, was identified to have a single gene for all-stage resistance, tentatively named YrTye. To map the gene, Tyee was crossed with 'Avocet Susceptible' (AvS). Genetic analysis of the F 1 , F 2 , F 2:3 , and BC 1 progenies confirmed a single dominant gene for resistance to race PSTv-37 that is avirulent to YrTye. A mapping population of 135 F 2 plants was phenotyped with PSTv-37 and the derived F 2:3 lines were tested with races PSTv-37, PSTv-40, and PSTv-79. The F 2 mapping population was genotyped with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. A genetic map comprising 13 SSR markers located YrTye in chromosome 3AS flanked distally by SSR marker wmc11 and proximally by wmc532 at 2.6 and 3.4 cM, respectively. Amplification of Chinese Spring 3A deletion lines placed the gene in the distal bin 3AS4-0.45 to 1.00. Because YrTye is different from all formally named Yr genes in chromosomal location, we permanently name the gene Yr76. A near-isogenic line of spring common wheat was developed and selected by testing F 3 lines derived from a AvS*4/Tyee cross with Tyee-avirulent and virulent races and the flanking markers. The specific SSR alleles flanking Yr76 were validated using cultivars and breeding lines with and without the gene, and showed high polymorphisms. The specificity of Yr76 is useful in differentiating P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races, and its tightly linked markers will be useful in developing resistant cultivars when combining the gene with other genes for resistance to stripe rust."

"27228577","abstracttext","Prolamin and resistance gene families are important in wheat food use and in defense against pathogen attacks, respectively. To better understand the evolution of these multi-gene families, the DNA sequence of a 2.8-Mb genomic region, representing an 8.8Â cM genetic interval and harboring multiple prolamin and resistance-like gene families, was analyzed in the diploid grass Aegilops tauschii, the D-genome donor of bread wheat. Comparison with orthologous regions from rice, Brachypodium, and sorghum showed that the Ae.Â tauschii region has undergone dramatic changes; it has acquired more than 80 non-syntenic genes and only 13 ancestral genes are shared among these grass species. These non-syntenic genes, including prolamin and resistance-like genes, originated from various genomic regions and likely moved to their present locations via sequence evolution processes involving gene duplication and translocation. Local duplication of non-syntenic genes contributed significantly to the expansion of gene families. Our analysis indicates that the insertion of prolamin-related genes occurred prior to the separation of the Brachypodieae and Triticeae lineages. Unlike in Brachypodium, inserted prolamin genes have rapidly evolved and expanded to encode different classes of major seed storage proteins in Triticeae species. Phylogenetic analyses also showed that the multiple insertions of resistance-like genes and subsequent differential expansion of each R gene family. The high frequency of non-syntenic genes and rapid local gene evolution correlate with the high recombination rate in the 2.8-Mb region with nine-fold higher than the genome-wide average. Our results demonstrate complex evolutionary dynamics in this agronomically important region of Triticeae species."

"2026143","abstracttext","Wheat transcription factors HBP-1a and HBP-1b bind to the hexamer motif, ACGTCA, of wheat histone gene promoters. HBP-1b also binds to the hexamer motif in the promoter of the 35S RNA gene of cauliflower mosaic virus, whereas HBP-1a does not. A cDNA clone encoding HBP-1b was isolated on the basis of its binding specificity to the hexamer motif. The deduced amino acid sequence indicates that HBP-1b, like HBP-1a, belongs to a leucine zipper class of transcription factors. Mutational analyses of the HBP-1a and -1b encoded cDNAs revealed that truncated polypeptides containing the leucine zipper and basic regions are sufficient for DNA binding. HBP-1a and -1b form homodimers, as expected from earlier studies on this class of transcription factors, but did not form heterodimers. Although the hexamer motif or its homologs exist in several plant genes, HBP-1a and -1b exhibited the highest binding affinity to the hexamer motif in the histone promoters, suggesting that both DNA binding proteins are involved in transcriptional regulation of wheat histone genes."

"6159921","abstracttext","A UMP-rich RNA fraction was separated from the bulk cellular RNA by affinity chromatography of wheat embryo total RNA. The obtained preparation was heterogeneous and contained polyribonucleotide chain segments which were resistant to RNAase T1 and consisted mainly of UMP residues (87 mol%). The UMP-rich segments were of various sizes, including large oligonucleotides and polynucleotides (up to approx. 150 nucleotides in length). The oligo(U)- and poly(U)-containing RNA fraction occurred in a low amount (approx. 1% of total RNA) both in dry and germinating wheat embryos. However, at the onset of germination, labelled precursors were preferentially incorporated into the UMP-rich RNA species. The early-synthesized RNA appeared and underwent a considerable degradation within the cell nuclei. It is assumed that both delayed maturation of structural gene transcripts and rapid transcription of regulatory gene units during initial germination stages contribute to the transient abundance of newly made UMP-rich RNA in the early wheat embryos."
"6204862","articletitle","Developmentally regulated plant genes: the nucleotide sequence of a wheat gliadin genomic clone."
"6204862","abstracttext","Gliadins, the major wheat seed storage proteins, are encoded by a multigene family. Northern blot analysis shows that gliadin genes are transcribed in endosperm tissue into two classes of poly(A)+ mRNA, 1400 bases (class I) and 1600 bases (class II) in length. Using poly(A)+ RNA from developing wheat endosperm we constructed a cDNA library from which a number of clones coding for alpha/beta and gamma gliadins were identified by hybrid-selected mRNA translation and DNA sequencing. These cDNA clones were used as probes for the isolation of genomic gliadin clones from a wheat genomic library. One such genomic clone was characterized in detail and its DNA sequence determined. It contains a gene for a 33-kd alpha/beta gliadin protein (a 20 amino acid signal peptide and a 266 amino acid mature protein) which is very rich in glutamine (33.8%) and proline (15.4%). The gene sequence does not contain introns. A typical eukaryotic promoter sequence is present at -104 (relative to the translation initiation codon) and there are two normal polyadenylation signals 77 and 134 bases downstream from the translation termination codon. The coding sequence contains some internal sequence repetition, and is highly homologous to several alpha/beta gliadin cDNA clones. Homology to a gamma-gliadin cDNA clone is low, and there is no homology with known glutenin or zein cDNA sequences."
"11459176","articletitle","Characterization of a wheat cDNA encoding mitochondrial ribosomal protein L11: qualitative and quantitative tissue-specific differences in its expression."
"11459176","abstracttext","We have cloned a cDNA for a ribosomal protein of wheat that is similar to the bacterial ribosomal protein L11 (RPL11). To determine the subcellular localization of the gene product, we fused the whole cDNA sequence to the coding sequence for Green Fluorescent Protein, and expressed the fusion product transiently in epidermal cells of pea hypocotyls or dayflower leaves. Localized fluorescence was detectable in mitochondria, indicating that this nuclear cDNA encodes a mitochondrial ribosomal protein L11 (MRPL11). In lower protists, mitochondrial RPL11 is encoded by the mitochondrial genome, but higher organisms, including animals, fungi and plants, do not have genes for RPL11 in their mitochondrial genomes, suggesting that transfer of the genetic information for RPL11 from the mitochondrial genome to the nucleus was a very early event in evolution. Transcripts of this wheat gene (TaMRPL11) for mitochondrial RPL11 were found in all tissues examined, although qualitative and quantitative differences in expression were noted. The transcript sizes were different in different plant tissues: 1.0 kb in flowers and roots, and 1.5 kb in shoots. Cold stress transiently increased the steady-state level of TaMRPL11 mRNA in shoots, but the transcription of TaMRPL11 was completely inhibited by cold treatment for longer periods. However, the transcript level in flowers decreased gradually on exposure to low temperature. On the other hand, the accumulation of TaMRPL11 transcripts in roots was not affected by low temperature. These results suggest that the expression of MRPL11 in wheat is regulated precisely, in a tissue-specific manner."

"10931910","abstracttext","Gibberella zeae causes wheat ear blight and produces trichothecene toxins in infected grain. In previous studies, trichothecene production in this fungus was disabled by specific disruption of the trichodiene synthase gene (Tri5) and was restored by two methods: gene reversion and transformation-mediated mutant complementation. In previous field tests of wheat ear blight, trichothecene-nonproducing mutants were less virulent than the wild-type progenitor strain from which they were derived. Trichothecene-producing revertants also were restored to wild-type levels of virulence. In contrast, in the field test of wheat ear blight reported here, trichothecene-producing strains obtained by Tri5 mutant complementation were not restored to wild-type levels of virulence. The complemented mutants showed a slightly reduced radial growth compared to the wild-type strain, but otherwise appeared normal in morphology, pigmentation and sexual fertility. Genetic analysis indicated that the aberrant virulence of a complemented mutant was likely due to non-target effects that occurred during the process of transforming the trichothecene-nonproducing mutant with Tri5. These results confirm previous findings that trichothecenes contribute to the virulence of G. zeae, but also demonstrate that manipulating this fungus in the laboratory may cause it to undergo subtle changes that reduce its virulence."

"11901130","abstracttext","The Sh2/A1 orthologous region of maize, rice, and sorghum contains five genes in the order Sh2, X1, X2, and two A1 homologs in tandem duplication. The Sh2 and A1 homologs are separated by approximately 20 kb in rice and sorghum and by approximately 140 kb in maize. We analyzed the fate of the Sh2/A1 region in large-genome species of the Triticeae (wheat, barley, and rye). In the Triticeae, synteny in the Sh2/A1 region was interrupted by a break between the X1 and X2 genes. The A1 and X2 genes remained colinear in homeologous chromosomes as in other grasses. The Sh2 and X1 orthologs also remained colinear but were translocated to a nonhomeologous chromosome. Gene X1 was duplicated on two nonhomeologous chromosomes, and surprisingly, a paralog shared homology much higher than that of the orthologous copy to the X1 gene of other grasses. No tandem duplication of A1 homologs was detected but duplication of A1 on a nonhomeologous barley chromosome 6H was observed. Intergenic distances expanded greatly in wheat compared to rice. Wheat and barley diverged from each other 12 million years ago and both show similar changes in the Sh2/A1 region, suggesting that the break in colinearity as well as X1 duplications and genome expansion occurred in a common ancestor of the Triticeae species."

"12504903","abstracttext","Plant high-mobility-group (HMG) chromosomal proteins are the most abundant and ubiquitous nonhistone proteins found in the nuclei of higher eukaryotes. There are only two families of HMG proteins, namely, HMGA and HMGB in plants. The cDNA encoding wheat HMGa protein was isolated and characterized. Wheat HMGA cDNA encodes a protein of 189 amino acid residues. At its N terminus, there is a histone H1-like structure, which is a common feature of plant HMGA proteins, followed by four AT-hook motifs. Polymerase chain reaction results show that the gene contains a single intron of 134 bp. All four AT-hook motifs are encoded by the second exon. Northern blot results show that the expression of HMGA gene is much higher in organs undergoing active cell proliferation. Gel retardation analysis show that wheat HMGa, b, c and histone H1 bind to four-way-junction DNA with high binding affinity, but affinity is dramatically reduced with increasing Mg(2+) and Na(+) ion concentration. Competition binding studies show that proteins share overlapping binding sites on four-way-junction DNA. HMGd does not bind to four-way-junction DNA."

Analyses of nucleotide sequence variations in 106 cereal chloroplast genes with tobacco sequences as the outgroup suggested that (1) most of the genic regions of the chloroplast genomes of maize, rice, and wheat have evolved at similar rates; (2) RNA genes have highly conservative evolutionary rates relative to the other genes; (3) photosynthetic genes have been under strong purifying selection; (4) between the three cereals, 14 genes which account for about 28% of the genic region have evolved with heterogeneous nucleotide substitution rates; and (5) rice genes tend to have evolved more slowly than the others at loci where rate heterogeneity exists. Although the mechanism that underlies chloroplast gene diversification is complex, our analyses identified variation in nonsynonymous substitution rates as a genetic force that generates heterogeneity, which is evidence of selection in chloroplast gene diversification at the intrafamilial level. Phylogenetic trees constructed with the variable nucleotide sites of the chloroplast genes place maize basal to the rice-wheat clade, revealing a close relationship between the Bambusoideae and Pooideae."

"12374300","abstracttext","A cDNA coding for phytocystatin, a protease inhibitor, was isolated from wheat embryos by differential display RT-PCR and the corresponding full-length cDNA (named WC5 for wheat cystatin gene 5) subsequently obtained by RACE. The deduced primary sequence of the protein suggests the presence of a 28 amino acid N-terminal signal sequence and a 100 amino acid mature protein containing the three consensus motifs known to interact with the active site of cysteine peptidases. Northern and western analysis revealed a spatio-temporal pattern of the cystatin gene expression during caryopse development. In the embryo, WC5 was only expressed during early embryogenesis whereas, in seed covering layers, WC5 expression was restricted to the maturation stage of grain development. In addition, immunolocalization experiments showed that cystatin accumulated in the aleurone layer of the maturating seed and in the parenchymal tissues of the embryo scutellum. A recombinant form of the wheat cystatin was shown to be able to inhibit peptidase activities present in whole seed protein extracts. In addition, immunological techniques allowed us to identify two putative target peptidases. The possible roles of the cystatin protein are discussed in relation with tissular localization and putative peptidase targets during seed maturation."

"12582685","abstracttext","Cereal centromeres consist of a complex organization of repetitive DNA sequences. Several repetitive DNA sequences are common amongst members of the Triticeae family, and others are unique to particular species. The organization of these repetitive elements and the abundance of other types of DNA sequences in cereal centromeres are largely unknown. In this study, we have used wheat-rye translocation lines to physically map 1BL.1RS centromeric breakpoints and molecular probes to obtain further information on the nature of other types of centromeric DNA sequences. Our results, using the rye-specific centromeric sequence, pAWRC.1, indicate that 1BL.1RS contains a small portion of the centromere from 1R of rye. Further studies used molecular markers to identify centromeric segments on wheat group-1 chromosomes. Selected RFLP markers, clustered around the centromere of wheat homoeologous group-1S chromosomes, were chosen as probes during Southern hybridization. One marker, PSR161, identified a small 1BS segment in all 1BL.1RS lines. This segment maps proximal to pAWRC.1 in 1BL.1RS and on the centromere of 1B. Sequence analysis of PSR161 showed high homology to HSP70 genes and Northern hybridization showed that this gene is constitutively expressed in leaf tissue and induced by heat shock and light stimuli. The significance of this work with respect to centromere organization and the possible significance of this HSP70 gene homologue are discussed."

"12582873","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight occurs in cereals throughout the world and is especially important in humid growing regions. Fusarium head blight (FHB) has re-emerged as a major disease of wheat and barley in the U.S. and Canada since 1993. The primary causal agents of FHB, Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium culmorum, can produce deoxynivalenol (DON), a trichothecene mycotoxin that enhances disease severity and poses a health hazard to humans and monogastric animals. To reduce the effects of DON on wheat, we have introduced FsTRI101, a Fusarium sporotrichioides gene formerly known as TriR, into the regenerable cultivar Bobwhite. TRI101 encodes an enzyme that transfers an acetyl moiety to the C3 hydroxyl group of trichothecenes. Four different transgenic plants carrying the FsTRI101 gene were identified. Although expression levels varied among the four lines, all of them accumulated FsTRI101 transcripts in endosperm and glume. TRI101-encoded acetyltransferase activity was detected in endosperm extracts of a single plant that accumulated FsTRI101 mRNA. Greenhouse resistance tests indicated that the accumulation of FsTRI101-encoded acetyltransferase in this plant confers partial protection against the spread of F. graminearum in inoculated wheat heads (spikes)."

"12582919","abstracttext","We have produced transgenic maize plants containing a wheat Glu-1Dx5 gene encoding the high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit 1Dx5. Analysis by SDS-PAGE showed that a protein similar in size to the wheat 1Dx5 subunit accumulates in the endosperm of transgenic maize from four independent transformation events. This protein reacts with a monoclonal antibody specific to the wheat 1Dx5 subunit and was not detected in nontransgenic controls or in pollen, anthers, leaves or embryos of plants grown from seeds expressing this protein in endosperm. Genomic Southern-blot analysis is consistent with results from SDS-PAGE and indicates that the transgene integration sites are complex and are different in the four events studied. Using the presence of this protein as a phenotypic marker, we studied the inheritance of this gene through three sexual generations. Reciprocal crosses with nontransgenic plants and self-pollinations were performed, and the resulting kernels were analyzed for the presence of the 1Dx5 subunit. These data, together with PCR analysis for the transgene, suggest that the transgene is inefficiently transmitted through pollen in all four events."

"12807787","abstracttext","From a wild diploid species that is a relative of wheat, Aegilops speltoides, a 301-bp repeat containing 16 copies of a CAA microsatellite was isolated. Southern blot and fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that approximately 250 bp of the sequence is tandemly arrayed at the centromere regions of A- and B-genome chromosomes of common wheat and rye chromosomes. Although the DNA sequence of this 250-bp repeat showed no notable homology in the databases, the flanking or intervening sequences between the repeats showed high homologies (>82%) to two separate sequences of the gag gene and its upstream region in cereba, a Ty3/gypsy-like retroelement of Hordeum vulgare. Since the amino acid sequence deduced from the 250 bp with seven CAAs showed some similarity ( approximately 53%) to that of the gag gene, we concluded that the 250-bp repeats had also originated from the cereba-like retroelements in diploid wheat such as Ae. speltoides and had formed tandem arrays, whereas the 300-bp repeats were dispersed as a part of cereba-like retroelements. This suggests that some tandem repeats localized at the centromeric regions of cereals and other plant species originated from parts of retrotransposons."

"12789432","abstracttext","A novel constitutive promoter from the maize histone H2Bgene was recently identified. In this study, we characterised H2B promoter activity in both wheat and maize tissues using the gusA reporter gene and two synthetic versions of the pat (phosphinothricin acetyl transferase) selectable marker gene, namely mopat and popat. Analyses of transgenic plants showed that the H2B promoter is able to drive the expression of gusA to strong, constitutive levels in wheat and maize tissues. Using an H2B:mopat construct and phosphinothricin selection, we recovered transgenic wheat plants at efficiencies ranging from 0.3% to 7.4% (mean 1.6%), and the efficiency of selection ranged from 40% to 100% (mean 77.7%). In another application, H2B was combined with the maize Ubi-1 or the maize Adh-1 intron to drive the expression of mopat and popat. Transformation efficiencies with the Ubi-1 intron were between 1.4- to 16-fold greater than with the Adh-1 intron. However, the use of either of the introns was necessary for the recovery of transgenic plants. Mopat gave higher transformation efficiencies and induced higher levels of PAT protein in maize tissues than popat."

"12590345","abstracttext","Wheat and barley contain at least four classes of starch synthases in the endosperm, granule bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) and starch synthases I, II and III (SSI, SSII, SSIII). In this work, SSII in barley is shown to be associated with the starch granule by using antibodies. A cDNA from barley encoding SSII and the genes for SSII from barley and Aegilops tauschii ( A. tauschii, the D genome donor to wheat) are characterised. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) and PCR were used to localise the wheat SSII gene to the short arm of chromosome 7, showing synteny with the location of the rice SSII gene to the short arm of chromosome 6. Comparison of the genes encoding SSII of A. tauschii, barley and Arabidopsis showed a conserved exon-intron structure although the size of the introns varied considerably. Extending such comparison between the genes encoding starch synthases (GBSSI, SSI, SSII and SSIII) from A. tauschii and Arabidopsis showed that the exon-intron structures are essentially conserved. Separate and distinct genes for the individual starch synthases therefore existed before the separation of monocotyledons and dicotyledons."

"15754209","abstracttext","The mitochondrial rps2 gene from barley, like that of rice, wheat, and maize, has an extended open reading frame (ORF) at the 3'-region when compared to that from lower plants. However, the extended portions are variable among these cereals. Since barley and wheat belong to the same tribe (Triticeae), it would be interesting to know when and where the two types of rps2 were generated during evolution. To determine this, we utilized the mitochondrial (mt) DNA sequence to examine variations of the rps2 genes in the tribe Triticeae. By means of the variable 3'-region, the distribution of barley (B)-type and wheat (W)-type rps2 sequences was studied in 19 genera of the tribe. The B-type sequence was identified in 10 of the 19 genera, whereas the W-type sequence was present in all 19 genera. Thus, ten of the examined genera have both types of rps2 sequences due to the presence of two copies of the gene. The W-type sequence was also present in the tribe Bromeae and the B-type sequence was also found in Aveneae and Poeae. Phylogenetic trees based on the B-type and W-type sequences were different from those based on other molecular data. This suggests that the mitochondrial genome in Triticeae has a unique evolutionary history."

"15965649","abstracttext","The incorporation of effective and durable disease resistance is an important breeding objective for wheat improvement. The leaf rust resistance gene Lr34 and stripe rust resistance gene Yr18 are effective at the adult plant stage and have provided moderate levels of durable resistance to leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks. and to stripe rust caused by Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici. These genes have not been separated by recombination and map to chromosome 7DS in wheat. In a population of 110 F(7) lines derived from a Thatcher x Thatcher isogenic line with Lr34/Yr18, field resistance to leaf rust conferred by Lr34 and to stripe rust resistance conferred by Yr18 cosegregated with adult plant resistance to powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis (DC) EO Speer f. sp. tritici. Lr34 and Yr18 were previously shown to be associated with enhanced stem rust resistance and tolerance to barley yellow dwarf virus infection. This chromosomal region in wheat has now been linked with resistance to five different pathogens. The Lr34/Yr18 phenotypes and associated powdery mildew resistance were mapped to a single locus flanked by microsatellite loci Xgwm1220 and Xgwm295 on chromosome 7DS."

"14651346","abstracttext","Differential responses in host-nematode pathotype interactions occur in wheat lines carrying different cereal cyst nematode resistance (Cre) genes. Cre1, located on chromosome 2B, confers resistance to most European nematodes and the sole Australian pathotype, while Cre3, present on chromosome 2D, is highly resistant to the Australian pathotype and susceptible to a number of European pathotypes. Genes encoding nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR) proteins that cosegregate with the Cre3 locus cross hybridize to homologues whose restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns distinguish near-isogenic Cre1 nematode-resistant wheat lines. Genetic mapping showed that the NBS-LRR gene members that distinguished the Cre1 near-isogenic lines were located on chromosome 2BL at a locus, designated Xcsl107, that cosegregates with the Cre1 locus. A haplotype of NBS-LRR genes from the Xcsl107 locus provides a diagnostic marker for the presence of Cre1 nematode resistance in a wide collection of wheat lines and segregating families. Genetic analysis of NBS-LRR haplotypes that cosegregate with Cre1 and Cre3 resistance, together with flanking cDNA markers and other markers from homoeologous group 2 chromosomes, revealed a conserved gene order that suggests Cre1 and Cre3 are homeoloci."
"15138688","articletitle","The genetics of non-host disease resistance in wheat to barley yellow rust."
"15138688","abstracttext","Non-host resistance is investigated as a potential source of durable resistance. However, the genetics of non-host resistance between closely related plant species and their corresponding pathogens would indicate that in these interactions, non-host resistance primarily involves major genes that operate on a gene-for-gene principal similar to that seen in host resistance. Wheat is a non-host of the barley-attacking form of the fungus responsible for yellow rust, i.e. Puccinia striiformis f. sp. hordei. While P. striiformis f. sp. hordei is generally unable to infect wheat, a partial susceptibility was exhibited by the wheat variety Chinese 166. Consequently, in the cross Lemhi x Chinese 166 two major QTLs for resistance to P. striiformis f. sp. hordei were identified: one on chromosome 1D and a second on 2B. These two QTLs accounted for 43.5% and 33.2% of the phenotypic variance for resistance to barley yellow rust, respectively. In addition, two QTLs of smaller effect were also identified: one on chromosome 5A, contributing 5.1% of the variance and a second on chromosome 6A, contributing 10.9% to the phenotype. The QTL on 6A was derived from the susceptible variety, Chinese 166. In all cases the resistance towards P. striiformis f. sp. hordei was associated with a visual chlorosis/necrosis response typical of race-specific host resistance."

"15032820","abstracttext","Expression profiles of a set of Cor/Lea genes were assessed during early stages of cold acclimation in seedlings of two wheat cultivars, which showed contrasting levels of freezing tolerance. These Cor/Lea family members consisted of three EST clones and 13 previously identified cDNA clones of wheat and rye. Northern blot analysis using RNA extracted from seedling leaves and roots showed that most of the genes exhibited a quite similar time-course of expression, although with different expression levels: They rapidly responded to low temperature and their transcript levels reached high plateaus within 3-5 days. The overall gene expression profiles were correlated with the time-dependent development and the level of freezing tolerance under low temperature in the two cultivars. Western blot analysis of protein accumulation further verified this observation. Abscissic acid response was proved for at least four genes. Light was stimulatory to most of the genes, and this positive light response associated with low temperature occurred not only in leaf-specific genes but also in leaf/root-expressed genes. Taken together, the present results suggest that the Cor/Lea gene family represents a major group of downstream genes involved in the ABA-dependent and -independent signal pathways and that most of them are co-regulated in determining freezing tolerance in wheat seedlings."

"15067508","abstracttext","The distal segment of the long arm of the Thinopyrum intermedium chromosome 7Ai1 carries the barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) resistance gene Bdv2. This segment was transferred to the distal region of the long arm of wheat chromosome 7D in the Yw series of translocation lines by using the ph1b mutant to induce homoeologous pairing. To transfer Bdv2 to commercial varieties, we developed two resistance gene-analog polymorphism (RGAP) markers, Tgp-1(350) and Tgp-2(210), and one randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) marker, OPD04(1300). The diagnostic fragments of the RGAP marker Tgp-1(350) and the RAPD marker OPD04(1300) were cloned, sequenced and converted into sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers, named SC-gp1 and SC-D04, respectively. SC-gp1 and SC-D04 were validated based on available translocation lines and segregating F(2) individuals. Our results indicated that the SCAR markers co-segregated with the BYDV resistance associated with Bdv2. Therefore, they can be used as a low-cost, high-throughput alternative to conventional phenotypic screening in wheat-breeding programs exploiting Bdv2. The marker-assisted selection for BYDV resistance was successfully performed in a wheat-breeding program."

"16187122","abstracttext","On the basis of sequence analysis, 69 known low-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (LMW-GS) genes were experimentally classified into nine groups by the deduced amino acid sequence of the highly conserved N-terminal domain. To clarify the chromosomal locations of these groups, 11 specific primer sets were designed to carry out polymerase chain reactions (PCR) with the genomic DNA of group 1 ditelosomic lines of Chinese Spring, among which nine primer sets proved to be LMW-GS group-specific. Each group of LMW-GS genes was specifically assigned on a single chromosome arm and hence to a specific locus. Therefore, these results provided the possibility to predict the chromosome location of a new LMW-GS gene based on its deduced N-terminal sequence. The validity of the classification was confirmed by the amplifications in 27 diploid wheat and Aegilops accessions. The length polymorphisms of LMW-GS genes of groups 1 and 2, and groups 3 and 4.1 were detected in diploid A-genome and S-genome accessions, respectively. The diploid wheat and Aegilops species could be used as valuable resources of novel allele variations of LMW-GS gene in the improvement of wheat quality. The nine LMW-GS group-specific primer sets could be utilized to select specific allele variations of LMW-GS genes in the marker-assisted breeding."
"16201238","articletitle","Molecular evidence of barley yellow dwarf virus replication/movement suppressed by the resistance gene Bdv2."
"16201238","abstracttext","A wheat-Thinopyrum intermedium translocation line YW642 possesses the resistance to GAV serotype of barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), in which the resistance gene Bdv2 is derived from the chromosome 7X of Thinopyrum intermedium group 7. It is interesting to analyze BYDV accumulation content in the resistant and susceptible wheat plants for controlling BYDV disease and understanding the resistance mechanism against BYDV. In the paper, semi-quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was used to detect and quantify BYDV-GAV in the resistant and susceptible plants using specific primers for the coat protein (CP) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes of BYDV-GAV serotype. On the inoculation site, the amount of the virus in the resistant wheat line (YW642) was much lower compared to the susceptible sib line (YW641). There was small amount of the virus could be detected in YW642 at 2-5 days post infestation (dpi), afterwards the amount of virus decreased and no virus could be detected at 14 and 16 dpi. In the uninoculated upper leaves, no BYDV was detected in YW642 from 1 to 14 dpi, while the virus could be detected at 3 dpi and then accumulated rapidly in YW641. These results showed at molecular level that the replication and/or movement of BYDV-GAV were strongly suppressed in YW642, presumably owing to the action of the BdV2 gene."

"16391697","abstracttext","Freezing tolerance in plants is a complex trait that occurs in many plant species during growth at low, nonfreezing temperatures, a process known as cold acclimation. This process is regulated by a multigenic system expressing broad variation in the degree of freezing tolerance among wheat cultivars. Microarray analysis is a powerful and rapid approach to gene discovery. In species such as wheat, for which large scale mutant screening and transgenic studies are not currently practical, genotype comparison by this methodology represents an essential approach to identifying key genes in the acquisition of freezing tolerance. A microarray was constructed with PCR amplified cDNA inserts from 1184 wheat expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that represent 947 genes. Gene expression during cold acclimation was compared in 2 cultivars with marked differences in freezing tolerance. Transcript levels of more than 300 genes were altered by cold. Among these, 65 genes were regulated differently between the 2 cultivars for at least 1 time point. These include genes that encode potential regulatory proteins and proteins that act in plant metabolism, including protein kinases, putative transcription factors, Ca2+ binding proteins, a Golgi localized protein, an inorganic pyrophosphatase, a cell wall associated hydrolase, and proteins involved in photosynthesis."
"19233304","articletitle","Trehalose biosynthesis is involved in sporulation of Stagonospora nodorum."
"19233304","abstracttext","Stagonospora nodorum is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen that is the causal agent of leaf and glume blotch on wheat. S. nodorum is a polycyclic pathogen, whereby rain-splashed pycnidiospores attach to and colonise wheat tissue and subsequently sporulate again within 2-3weeks. As several cycles of infection are needed for a damaging infection, asexual sporulation is a critical phase of its infection cycle. A non-targeted metabolomics screen for sporulation-associated metabolites identified that trehalose accumulated significantly in concert with asexual sporulation both in vitro and in planta. A reverse-genetics approach was used to investigate the role of trehalose in asexual sporulation. Trehalose biosynthesis was disrupted by deletion of the gene Tps1, encoding a trehalose 6-phosphate synthase, resulting in almost total loss of trehalose during in vitro growth and in planta. In addition, lesion development and pycnidia formation were also significantly reduced in tps1 mutants. Reintroduction of the Tps1 gene restored trehalose biosynthesis, pathogenicity and sporulation to wild-type levels. Microscopic examination of tps1 infected wheat leaves showed that pycnidial formation often halted at an early stage of development. Further examination of the tps1 phenotype revealed that tps1 pycnidiospores exhibited a reduced germination rate while under heat stress, and tps1 mutants had a reduced growth rate while under oxidative stress. This study confirms a link between trehalose biosynthesis and pathogen fitness in S.nodorum."

"18945009","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Phaeosphaeria nodorum was sampled from nine wheat fields across a 30-km transect representing three geographical regions in Switzerland to determine the scale of genetic differentiation among subpopulations. Three different wheat cultivars were sampled three times to determine whether differences in host genotype correlated with differences among corresponding pathogen populations. Seven restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) loci and one DNA fingerprint were assayed for each of the 432 isolates in the collection. DNA fingerprints differentiated 426 unique genotypes. Though absolute differences were small, five RFLP loci exhibited significant differences in allele frequencies across the nine sub-populations. Gene diversity within all subpopulations was high (H(T) = 0.51), but only 3% of the total genetic variation was distributed among the nine subpopulations. When subpopulations were grouped according to geographical region or host cultivar, less than 1% of the genetic variation was distributed among groups, suggesting widespread gene flow and the absence of pathogen adaptation to specific wheat cultivars. Tests for gametic equilibrium within subpopulations and across the entire Swiss population supported the hypothesis of random mating."

"18937919","abstracttext","A few EST-derived STS markers localized on Qfhs.ndsu-3BS, a major QTL for resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat, have been previously identified in the 'Sumai 3'/'Stoa' population. In this study, we used a 'Wangshuibai' (resistant) /'Seri82' (susceptible) derived population, linkage group, QTL, and quantitative gene expression analysis to assess the genetic background dependence and stability of the EST-derived STS markers for use in marker aided selection to improve FHB resistance in wheat. Based on our results, a QTL in the map interval of Xsts3B-138_1-Xgwm493 on chromosome 3BS was detected for FHB resistance, which accounted for up to 16% of the phenotypic variation. BLASTN analysis indicated that Xsts3B-138_1 sequence had significant similarity with the resistance gene analogue. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that the relative expression of Xsts3B-138_1 in 'Wangshuibai' at 96 h after inoculation was 2.6 times higher than 'Seri82'. Our results underlined that EST-derived STS3B-138 markers could be predominantly used in marker aided selection to improve FHB resistance in wheat."

"16896709","abstracttext","A doubled haploid population constructed from a cross between the South Australian wheat cultivars 'Trident' and 'Molineux' was grown under winter field conditions, under field conditions over summer and under artificial light both with and without vernalisation. The duration from planting to ear-emergence was recorded and QTL associated with heading date were detected using a previously constructed genetic linkage map. Associations were shown with chromosomal regions syntenous to previously identified photoperiod (Ppd-B1) and vernalisation (Vrn-A1) sensitive loci. Additional QTL associated with time to heading were also identified on chromosomes 1A, 2A, 2B, 6D, 7A and 7B. Comparisons between the genetic associations observed under the different growing conditions allowed the majority of these loci to be classified as having either photoperiod-sensitive, vernalisation-sensitive or earliness per se actions. The identification of a photoperiod-sensitive QTL on chromosome 1A provides evidence for a wheat gene possibly homoeologous to Ppd-H2 previously identified on chromosome 1H of barley. The occurrence of a putative major gene for photoperiod sensitivity observed on chromosome 7A is presented. The combined additive effects at these loci accounted for more than half the phenotypic variance in the duration from planting to ear-emergence in this population. The possible role of these loci on the adaptation of wheat in Australia is discussed."

"17453333","abstracttext","Isolation of disease resistance gene analogs (RGAs) using the conserved motifs of the resistance genes has attracted considerable attention since it was first reported more than a decade ago. In this study, RGAs are isolated using homology-based PCR to target the nucleotide binding site (NBS) conserved regions from hexaploid wheat varieties and a few accessions of wild types. Based on sequence similarity analysis, 83 of the sequenced clones were clustered as groups. Of these RGAs, 40 were in the NBS-LLR class, containing kinase-1a (GGVGKTT or GGVGKTA), kinase-2 (KRFLIVLDDXW), kinase-3a (GSXIVVITTR or GCXVLATTR), and the GLPL motif of the NBS-spanning region. Among these, 15 contained possible intron regions, similar to Avena sativa O2 NBS-LLR type disease resistance gene (AF078874), and one to Rpm1 of rice and Yr10 and Lr10 of wheat. To our knowledge, this is the first observation of an intronic site within the P-loop domain of wheat RGAs. We detected an unspecified motif (VMVCVS) between the kinase-1a and kinase-2 domains within our clones. Additionally, one of the clones showed replacement with the kinase-3a motif with an undefined sequence."

"20044743","abstracttext","While canopy temperature (CT) shows a strong and reliable association with yield under drought and heat stress and is used in wheat breeding to select for yield, little is known of its genetic control. The objective of this study was to determine the gene action controlling CT in five wheat populations grown in diverse environments (heat, drought, and well-irrigated conditions). CT showed negative phenotypic correlations with grain yield under drought and well-irrigated environments. Additive x additive effects were most prevalent and significant for all crosses and environments. Dominance and dominance x dominance gene actions were also found, though the significance and direction was specific for each environment and genotypic cross. The use of CT as a selection criterion to improve tolerance to drought was supported by its significant association with grain yield and the genotype differences observed between cultivars. Our results indicated that genetic gains for CT in wheat could be achieved through conventional breeding. However, given some dominance and epistatic effects, it would be necessary to delay the selection process until the frequency of heterozygous loci within families is reduced."

"20573045","abstracttext","Based on the in silico analysis of the representation of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in wheat grain-related cDNA libraries, a specific 15k oligonucleotide microarray has been developed in order to monitor environmental stress-dependent gene expression changes in the wheat caryopses. Using this array, the effect of water withdrawal, with and without additional heat stress, has been investigated during the first five days of kernel development on two wheat cultivars differing in their drought sensitivity. Water shortage affected (more than twofold change) the expression of only 0.5% of the investigated genes. A parallel heat treatment increased the ratio of responding genes to 5-7% because of the temperature stress and/or the increased water deficit because of enhanced evaporation. It could be established that the two cultivars, differing in their long-term adaptation capabilities to drought, responded to the short and direct stress treatments on the same way. In response to the combined drought and heat treatment, the coordinately altered expression of genes coding for storage proteins, enzymes involved in sugar/starch metabolism, histone proteins, heat shock proteins, proteases, tonoplast aquaporins as well as several transcription factors has been observed. These gene expression changes were in agreement with histological data that demonstrated the accelerated development of the embryo as well as the endosperm."

"20367465","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum are the causal agents of Fusarium ear blight (FEB) in wheat. A forward genetics approach was taken to discover novel pathogenicity genes in the genome of F. graminearum. A library of transformants created by random plasmid insertional mutagenesis was screened on wheat ears for virulence defects. Plasmid rescue on one of the reduced-virulence mutants revealed a single-copy plasmid insertion in the gene coding for the DNA interacting enzyme, topoisomerase I. Targeted topoisomerase I gene-deletion mutants were created in strains of both F. graminearum and F. culmorum. The top1 mutants of both species exhibited greatly reduced virulence in wheat ear infection assays (GO:0009405 and GO:0044145). Detailed microscopy analyses revealed that top1 hyphal growth was restricted to palea tissue whereas host responses were discernable 1,000 mum further away in the rachis node. Asexual sporulation was reduced in the F. graminearum mutants and was absent from the F. culmorum mutants. The F. graminearum mutant did not develop sexual spores when subjected to an in vitro perithecia production assay. During in vitro growth, the top1 mutants of both species were still able to produce the trichothecene mycotoxin, deoxynivalenol."

"20409001","abstracttext","Infestation of wheat by Hessian fly larvae causes a variety of physical and biochemical modifications of the host plant. Changes occur in cuticle permeability, lipid composition and gene transcript abundance, and these responses differ substantially between resistant and susceptible wheat lines. Staining assays revealed that susceptible plants exhibited a generalized increase in leaf sheath epidermal permeability during infestation; whereas, epidermal permeability was only minimally affected in resistant plants. Furthermore, temporal profiling using gas chromatographic methods revealed that changes in cuticle lipid (wax and cutin) composition correlated well with differing levels of epidermal permeability in susceptible and resistant plants. Temporal analysis of cuticle-associated gene mRNA levels, by quantitative real-time PCR, indicated a relationship between transcript abundance and changes in cuticle lipid profiles of resistant and susceptible plants. Results suggest that conserving cuticle integrity via induction of specific wax constituents and maintenance of cutin amounts, determined by the accumulation of cuticle-associated transcripts, could be important components of wheat resistance to Hessian fly larvae."
"19756538","articletitle","A reference-gene-based quantitative PCR method as a tool to determine Fusarium resistance in wheat."
"19756538","abstracttext","In recent years, plant breeders made great progress in breeding Fusarium-tolerant wheat lines. However, total resistance to this genus of plant pathogenic fungi has not yet been achieved as the resistance genes are located on several distinct genetic regions. Visual scoring of disease symptoms in combination with the analysis of mycotoxins is commonly applied to assess the tolerance of new lines. Both approaches are indirect methods and do not mandatorily determine the accumulated fungal biomass. Quantitative PCR is a useful tool to assess fungal biomass based on the abundance of organism-specific DNA. The aim of this study was the development of a quantitative PCR assay for trichothecene-producing Fusarium species and to adapt this method for resistance assessment of wheat lines artificially infected with Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium culmorum. Several DNA-extraction methods for wheat samples were evaluated and optimized for downstream real-time PCR analysis and furthermore, a new reference-gene-based approach for more accurate quantification of Fusarium biomass in cereals is presented. The co-determination of a plant gene was used to compensate for unequal DNA-extraction efficiencies."

"21986316","abstracttext","A homology search of wheat chloroplast (ct) and mitochondrial (mt) genomes identified 54 ctDNA segments that have homology with 66 mtDNA segments. The mtDNA segments were classified according to their origin: orthologs (prokaryotic origin), xenologs (interorganellar DNA transfer origin) and paralogs (intraorganellar DNA amplification origin). The 66 mtDNA sequences with homology to ctDNA segments included 14 paralogs, 18 orthologs and 34 xenologs. Analysis of the xenologs indicated that the DNA transfer occurred unidirectionally from the ct genome to the mt genome. The evolutionary timing of each interorganellar DNA transfer that generated a xenolog was estimated. This analysis showed that 2 xenologs originated early in green plant evolution, 4 in angiosperm evolution, 3 in monocotyledon evolution, 9 during cereal diversification and 8 in the evolution of wheat. Six other xenologs showed recurrent transfer from the ct to mt genomes in more than one taxon. The two remaining xenologs were uninformative on the evolutionary timing of their transfer. The wheat mt nad9 gene was found to be chimeric, consisting of the cereal nad9 gene and its 291 bp 5'-flanking region that included a 58 bp xenolog of the ct-ndhC origin."

A type II myosin gene from the Chinese F. graminearum strain 5035, isolated from infected wheat spikes, was identified by screening a mutant library generated by restriction enzyme-mediated integration. Disruption of the Myo2 gene reduced mycelial growth by 50% and conidiation by 76-fold, and abolished sexual reproduction on wheat kernels. The Îmyo2 mutants also had a 97% decrease in their pathogenicity on wheat, and mycotoxin production fell to just 3.4% of the normal level. The distribution of nuclei and septa was abnormal in the mutants, and the septal ultrastructure appeared disorganized. Time-lapse imaging of septation provided direct evidence that Myo2 is required for septum initiation and formation, and revealed the dynamic behavior of GFP-tagged Myo2 during hyphal and macroconidia development, particularly in the delimiting septum of phialides and macroconidial spores. Microarray analysis identified many genes with altered expression profiles in the Îmyo2 mutant, indicating that Myo2 is required for several F. graminearum developmental processes and biological activities."

This investigation has produced a new Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter strain that facilitates the quick and easy assessment of plant infection. The constitutively expressed gpdA:GUS strain of Fusarium graminearum was used to quantify the overall colonisation pattern. Histochemical and biochemical approaches confirmed, in susceptible wheat ear infections, the presence of a substantial phase of symptomless fungal growth. Separate analyses demonstrated that there was a reduction in the quantity of physiologically active hyphae as the wheat ear infection proceeded. A simplified linear system of rachis infection was then utilised to evaluate the expression of several TRI genes by RT-qPCR. Fungal gene expression at the advancing front of symptomless infection was compared with the origin of infection in the rachis. This revealed that TRI gene expression was maximal at the advancing front and supports the hypothesis that the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol plays a role in inhibiting plant defences in advance of the invading intercellular hyphae. This study has also demonstrated that there are transcriptional differences between the various phases of fungal infection and that these differences are maintained as the infection proceeds."

In this study, one copy of TaSnRK2.7, a SnRK2 member of common wheat, was isolated and characterized for nucleotide diversity among 45 wheat accessions with different stress-response features. Most of the accessions were elite wheat cultivars, which had been subject to population bottlenecks and intensive selection during breeding. Nucleotide and haplotype diversity across the entire TaSnRK2.7-A region was 0.00076 and 0.590, respectively, and diversity in non-coding regions was higher than that in coding regions. Sliding-window analysis showed variable levels of nucleotide variation along the entire TaSnRK2.7-A region; the sixth intron and ninth exon represented variation-enriched regions. As predicted, neutrality tests revealed that population bottlenecks or purifying selection had acted on the TaSnRK2.7-A gene, a relatively conserved gene. Furthermore, strong linkage disequilibrium between SNP loci extends across the entire TaSnRK2.7-A region. These findings demonstrate that the TaSnRK2.7-A genomic region has evolved under extensive selection pressure during crop breeding."

Using homologous PCR, we screened a cDNA library of the wheat resistance gene Yr5 from a near-isogenic line in the susceptible common wheat variety Taichung 29, which was inoculated with an incompatible race CYR32 of Puccinia striiformis. We isolated a novel full-length cDNA encoding calreticulin protein, which we named TaCRT1. Sequence analyses indicated that TaCRT1 contains an open reading frame of 1287 bp in length; it was deduced to encode 428 amino acids. Clustering analysis showed that TaCRT1 belongs to group III of the calreticulin protein family. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to analyze expression profiles of the isolated gene under biotic and abiotic stresses. Expression of TaCRT1 was suppressed by exogenous application of phytohormones, such as abscisic acid and methyl jasmonate, and by dehydration; but it was induced by CYR32 infection and cold treatment. Based on the expression patterns, we propose that TaCRT1 participates in regulatory processes involved in defense responses and stress resistance in wheat."

"22215965","abstracttext","In this work, we examined the genetic diversity and evolution of the WAG-2 gene based on new WAG-2 alleles isolated from wheat and its relatives. Only single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and no insertions and deletions (indels) were found in exon sequences of WAG-2 from different species. More SNPs and indels occurred in introns than in exons. For exons, exons+introns and introns, the nucleotide polymorphism Ï decreased from diploid and tetraploid genotypes to hexaploid genotypes. This finding indicated that the diversity of WAG-2 in diploids was greater than in hexaploids because of the strong selection pressure on the latter. All dn/ds ratios were < 1.0, indicating that WAG-2 belongs to a conserved gene affected by negative selection. Thirty-nine of the 57 particular SNPs and eight of the 10 indels were detected in diploid species. The degree of divergence in intron length among WAG-2 clones and phylogenetic tree topology suggested the existence of three homoeologs in the A, B or D genome of common wheat. Wheat AG-like genes were divided into WAG-1 and WAG-2 clades. The latter clade contained WAG-2, OsMADS3 and ZMM2 genes, indicating functional homoeology among them."

In this study, all eight mature isoforms of the ToxA protein were purified and compared. Circular dichroism spectra indicated that all isoforms were structurally intact and had indistinguishable secondary structural features. ToxA isoforms were infiltrated into wheat lines that carry the sensitivity gene Tsn1. It was observed that different wheat lines carrying identical Tsn1 alleles varied in sensitivity to ToxA. All ToxA isoforms induced necrosis when introduced into any Tsn1 wheat line but we observed quantitative variation in effector activity, with the least-active version found in isolates of P. tritici-repentis. Pathogen sporulation increased with higher doses of ToxA. The isoforms that induced the most rapid necrosis also induced the most sporulation, indicating that pathogen fitness is affected by differences in ToxA activity. We show that differences in toxin activity encoded by a single gene can contribute to the quantitative inheritance of necrotrophic virulence. Our findings support the hypothesis that the variation at ToxA results from selection that favors increased toxin activity."

"23246929","abstracttext","The wheat curl mite (WCM) is a major pest in cereal crops around the world and the vector of at least four known pathogens capable of reducing yields in crops such as wheat, corn, barley, oats, millet and rye. Current taxonomy recognizes WCM as a single species, Aceriatosichella; however, recent genetic, physiological and ecological studies have shown that WCM is likely to be a species complex. In this study we assessed genetic variation and phylogenetic relationships among WCM from four continents and a wide range of host plants using DNA sequence data from one mitochondrial gene, one nuclear gene and a single nuclear intergenic spacer region. Phylogenetic analyses revealed 11 unique mite lineages associated with specific plant hosts including wheat and barley. Host associations were consistent across continents, often with a single haplotype dominating a host plant regardless of geographic origin. The genetic and ecological differences identified in this study support the notion that WCM is a species complex in need of major taxonomic revision. These findings have implications for control of WCM globally, particularly within the context of identifying plants that form 'green bridge' refuges, assessing disease transmission risk, and identifying resistance in cereal genotypes to WCM and associated pathogens."

"24427285","abstracttext","Abiotic stresses are major environmental factors that affect agricultural productivity worldwide. NAC transcription factors play pivotal roles in abiotic stress signaling in plants. As a staple crop, wheat production is severely constrained by abiotic stresses whereas only a few NAC transcription factors have been characterized functionally. To promote the application of NAC genes in wheat improvement by biotechnology, a novel NAC gene designated TaNAC67 was characterized in common wheat. To determine its role, transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing TaNAC67-GFP controlled by the CaMV-35S promoter was generated and subjected to various abiotic stresses for morphological and physiological assays. Gene expression showed that TaNAC67 was involved in response to drought, salt, cold and ABA treatments. Localization assays revealed that TaNAC67 localized in the nucleus. Morphological analysis indicated the transgenics had enhanced tolerances to drought, salt and freezing stresses, simultaneously supported by enhanced expression of multiple abiotic stress responsive genes and improved physiological traits, including strengthened cell membrane stability, retention of higher chlorophyll contents and Na(+) efflux rates, improved photosynthetic potential, and enhanced water retention capability. Overexpression of TaNAC67 resulted in pronounced enhanced tolerances to drought, salt and freezing stresses, therefore it has potential for utilization in transgenic breeding to improve abiotic stress tolerance in crops."

The level of RFLP in the segregating population was high, and thus allowed more than half of the RFLP loci to be mapped, despite partial homozygosity in the parental F2 plant. Eight further loci were mapped in an unrelated F2 rye population, and a further two were placed by inference from equivalent genetic maps of related wheat chromosomes, allowing a consensus map of rye chromosome 5R, consisting of 29 points and spanning 129 cM, to be constructed. The location of the ct2 dwarfing gene was shown to be separated from the segment of the primitive 4RL translocated to 5RL, and thus the gene is probably genetically unrelated to the major GA-insensitive Rht genes of wheat located on chromosome arms 4BS and 4DS. The map position of Sp1 is consistent both with those of wheat Vrn1 and Vrn3, present on chromosome arms 5AL and 5DL, respectively, and with barley Sh2 which is distally located on chromosome arm 7L (= 5HL)."

Using Chinese Spring (CS) monosomic 1D, single chromosome substitution lines of chromosome 5B or chromosome arm 5BL from Chinese Spring into six varieties, and F1 hybrids heterozygous for the 1B chromosome structure (1BL-1BS/1BL-1RS), the anther culture response was studied: genes on CS1D chromosome and 5BL chromosome arm increases the embryo frequency; gene(s) involved in regeneration ability are located on the 1RS chromosome arm; a gene increasing albina frequency is located on Chinese Spring 5B chromosome. Our results support the fact that without gametic selection, a differential development occurred from the particular classes of microspores carrying genes for higher regeneration ability. Moreover, in some crosses, a few genes with major effects were involved in determination of anther culture response."

"24601983","abstracttext","Wheat yellow (stripe) rust, caused by the obligate biotrophic fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is a continual threat to wheat fields worldwide. New isolates with increased virulence have recently emerged driving breeding efforts to incorporate disease resistance genes which confer potentially more durable, albeit partial, resistance. Yr36 is one such locus which was recently cloned (WKS1) and described as a high-temperature adult-plant gene being effective only at temperatures above 25Â°C. We examined the potential use of Yr36 at temperatures below 25Â°C. Field experiments in the United Kingdom across 2 years show that lines carrying Yr36 provide slow rusting resistance to the yellow rust pathogen. Juvenile and adult Yr36 isogenic lines showed partial resistance at temperatures below 18Â°C under control environment conditions in tetraploid and hexaploid genetic backgrounds, but not at seedling stage, when inoculated with U.K. P. striiformis isolates. This partial resistance phenotype was similar to that observed previously at temperatures â¥25Â°C. Transgenic complementation tests and ethyl methanesulfonate mutants showed that the low-temperature partial resistance was due to the WKS1 gene. This study indicates that Yr36 has the potential to be an effective source of partial resistance in temperate wheat growing regions."
"25135325","articletitle","A novel wheat bZIP transcription factor, TabZIP60, confers multiple abiotic stress tolerances in transgenic Arabidopsis."
"25135325","abstracttext","The basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors (TFs) play vital roles in the response to abiotic stress. However, little is known about the function of bZIP genes in wheat abiotic stress. In this study, we report the isolation and functional characterization of the TabZIP60 gene. Three homologous genome sequences of TabZIP60 were isolated from hexaploid wheat and mapped to the wheat homoeologous group 6. A subcellular localization analysis indicated that TabZIP60 is a nuclear-localized protein that activates transcription. Furthermore, TabZIP60 gene transcripts were strongly induced by polyethylene glycol, salt, cold and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. Further analysis showed that the overexpression of TabZIP60 in Arabidopsis resulted in significantly improved tolerances to drought, salt, freezing stresses and increased plant sensitivity to ABA in seedling growth. Meanwhile, the TabZIP60 was capable of binding ABA-responsive cis-elements that are present in promoters of many known ABA-responsive genes. A subsequent analysis showed that the overexpression of TabZIP60 led to enhanced expression levels of some stress-responsive genes and changes in several physiological parameters. Taken together, these results suggest that TabZIP60 enhances multiple abiotic stresses through the ABA signaling pathway and that modifications of its expression may improve multiple stress tolerances in crop plants."
"25146486","articletitle","Characterization of a wheat R2R3-MYB transcription factor gene, TaMYB19, involved in enhanced abiotic stresses in Arabidopsis."
"25146486","abstracttext","MYB-type proteins have been shown to participate in multiple stress responses. In the present study, we identified a gene in wheat induced by multiple abiotic stresses, TaMYB19, which encodes a R2R3-type MYB protein. Three highly homologous sequences of TaMYB19 were isolated from hexaploid wheat. Using the nulli-tetrasomic (NT) lines of Chinese Spring wheat, the three sequences were localized to chromosomes 1A, 1B and 1D and designated as TaMYB19-A, TaMYB19-B and TaMYB19-D, respectively. The expression patterns of these three genes were similar under different stress conditions. The TaMYB19-B sequence was selected for further analysis. The TaMYB19-B protein localized to the nucleus. A detailed characterization of Arabidopsis transgenic plants overexpressing the TaMYB19-B gene revealed that the TaMYB19-B protein could improve tolerance to multiple stresses during the seedling stage. We also found that the overexpression of TaMYB19-B resulted in changes in several physiological indices and altered the expression levels of a number of abiotic stress-related genes, allowing the plants to overcome adverse conditions. These results indicate that the TaMYB19 protein plays an important role in plant stress tolerance and that modification of the expression of this protein may improve abiotic stress tolerance in crop plants."

"26296598","abstracttext","The benzoxazolinone class of phytoalexins are released by wheat, maize, rye and other agriculturally important species in the Poaceae family upon pathogen attack. Benzoxazolinones show antimicrobial effects on plant pathogens, but certain fungi have evolved mechanisms to actively detoxify these compounds which may contribute to the virulence of the pathogens. In many Fusarium spp. a cluster of genes is thought to be involved in the detoxification of benzoxazolinones. However, only one enzyme encoded in the cluster has been unequivocally assigned a role in this process. The first step in the detoxification of benzoxazolinones in Fusarium spp. involves the hydrolysis of a cyclic ester bond. This reaction is encoded by the FDB1 locus in F. verticillioides but the underlying gene is yet to be cloned. We previously proposed that FDB1 encodes a Î³-lactamase, and here direct evidence for this is presented. Expression analyses in the important wheat pathogen F. pseudograminearum demonstrated that amongst the three predicted Î³-lactamase genes only the one designated as FDB1, part of the proposed benzoxazolinone cluster in F. pseudograminearum, was strongly responsive to exogenous benzoxazolinone application. Analysis of independent F. pseudograminearum and F. graminearum FDB1 gene deletion mutants, as well as biochemical assays, demonstrated that the Î³-lactamase enzyme, encoded by FDB1, catalyses the first step in detoxification of benzoxazolinones. Overall, our results support the notion that Fusarium pathogens that cause crown rot and head blight on wheat have adopted strategies to overcome host-derived chemical defences."
"25719507","articletitle","An assessment of heavy ion irradiation mutagenesis for reverse genetics in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)."
"25719507","abstracttext","Reverse genetic techniques harnessing mutational approaches are powerful tools that can provide substantial insight into gene function in plants. However, as compared to diploid species, reverse genetic analyses in polyploid plants such as bread wheat can present substantial challenges associated with high levels of sequence and functional similarity amongst homoeologous loci. We previously developed a high-throughput method to identify deletions of genes within a physically mutagenized wheat population. Here we describe our efforts to combine multiple homoeologous deletions of three candidate disease susceptibility genes (TaWRKY11, TaPFT1 and TaPLDÃ1). We were able to produce lines featuring homozygous deletions at two of the three homoeoloci for all genes, but this was dependent on the individual mutants used in crossing. Intriguingly, despite extensive efforts, viable lines possessing homozygous deletions at all three homoeoloci could not be produced for any of the candidate genes. To investigate deletion size as a possible reason for this phenomenon, we developed an amplicon sequencing approach based on synteny to Brachypodium distachyon to assess the size of the deletions removing one candidate gene (TaPFT1) in our mutants. These analyses revealed that genomic deletions removing the locus are relatively large, resulting in the loss of multiple additional genes. The implications of this work for the use of heavy ion mutagenesis for reverse genetic analyses in wheat are discussed."

"26860054","abstracttext","Tubby proteins are highly conserved in a wide range of multicellular organisms. The Tubby gene family was first verified in obese mice. In plants, 11 Tubby genes have been identified in Arabidopsis, 14 in rice, and 11 in poplar. However, there is very little information about Tubby-like proteins in wheat. In this study, we identified four Tubby-like protein genes (TaTULP1-TaTULP4) in wheat. A comparison of the gene structure showed a conserved exon number pattern in TaTULPs, although the length of the introns differed. With the exception of TaTULP2, TaTULPs had four exons. To identify the chromosome localization of TaTULPs, BLASTn analyses were performed using the URGI database to predict the chromosomal location of TaTULP genes. TaTULP1, 2, 3 and 4 genes were localized on chromosomes 4, 5, 7 and 2. All TaTULPs harbor a Tubby domain in their C-terminal region and an F-box domain in the N terminus. We investigated protein-protein interactions between the F-box domain of TaTULPs and various wheat SKP1-like proteins (TaSKPs) using the yeast two-hybrid system. TaTULP1, TaTULP3 and TaTULP4 were found to interact with TaSKP1, TaSKP3 and TaSKP6, whereas TaTULP2 showed no interaction with TaSKP proteins. TaTULP proteins tagged with green fluorescent protein were targeted to the Golgi apparatus in plant cells. Our analysis of TaTULPs will aid in understanding the functions of TaTULPs in plants."

"26909990","abstracttext","Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are highly informative, polymorphic, and co-dominant Mendelian markers that provide an important genomic resource for genetic research. Recently, the use of large-scale transcriptome sequence has become a reliable and efficient approach for the identification and development of new EST-SSR markers. In this study, 8389 potential SSRs with a minimum of five repetitions for all motifs were identified from 121,210 unigenes. Gene ontology analysis indicated that the unigenes containing SSR loci participate in various biological processes of regulation, growth, development, metabolism, and apoptosis in wheat. As in many other plants, trinucleotide repeats were found to be the most abundant repeat units with a frequency of 62.33%. A subset of 300 EST-SSRs was randomly selected for the applicability of EST-SSRs to be evaluated. Of the 300 primer pairs tested, 177 (59%) yielded unambiguous PCR products among five wheat cultivars. Using the Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic line, 131 of the 177 EST-SSR primer pairs yielded products and 178 loci were found to be located on all the 21 wheat chromosomes. These findings suggest that the novel EST-SSR markers, as a basis for future genetic linkage and gene tagging analysis, are a valuable tool for genetic mapping, marker assisted selection, and comparative genome analysis."

"26539199","abstracttext","Plants are frequently exposed to microorganisms like fungi, bacteria, and viruses that cause biotic stresses. Fusarium head blight (FHB) is an economically risky wheat disease, which occurs upon Fusarium graminearum (Fg) infection. Moderately susceptible (cv. ""Mizrak 98"") and susceptible (cv. ""Gun 91"") winter type bread wheat cultivars were subjected to transcriptional profiling after exposure to Fg infection. To examine the early response to the pathogen in wheat, we measured gene expression alterations in mock and pathogen inoculated root crown of moderately susceptible (MS) and susceptible cultivars at 12 hours after inoculation (hai) using 12X135K microarray chip. The transcriptome analyses revealed that out of 39,179 transcripts, 3668 genes in microarray were significantly regulated at least in one time comparison. The majority of differentially regulated transcripts were associated with disease response and the gene expression mechanism. When the cultivars were compared, a number of transcripts and expression alterations varied within the cultivars. Especially membrane related transcripts were detected as differentially expressed. Moreover, diverse transcription factors showed significant fold change values among the cultivars. This study presented new insights to understand the early response of selected cultivars to the Fg at 12 hai. Through the KEGG analysis, we observed that the most altered transcripts were associated with starch and sucrose metabolism and gluconeogenesis pathways."

"26693688","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is a broad host pathogen threatening cereal crops in temperate regions around the world. To better understand how F. graminearum adapts to different hosts, we have performed a comparison of the transcriptome of a single strain of F. graminearum during early infection (up to 4 d post-inoculation) of barley, maize, and wheat using custom oligomer microarrays. Our results showed high similarity between F. graminearum transcriptomes in infected wheat and barley spike tissues. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to validate the gene expression profiles of 24 genes. Host-specific expression of genes was observed in each of the three hosts. This included expression of distinct sets of genes associated with transport and secondary metabolism in each of the three crops, as well as host-specific patterns for particular gene categories such as sugar transporters, integral membrane protein PTH11-like proteins, and chitinases. This study identified 69 F. graminearum genes as preferentially expressed in developing maize kernels relative to wheat and barley spikes. These host-specific differences showcase the genomic flexibility of F. graminearum to adapt to a range of hosts."

"27135677","abstracttext","Although the roles of salicylate (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) have been well-characterized in Fusarium head blight (FHB)-infected cereals, the roles of other phytohormones remain more ambiguous. Here, the association between an array of phytohormones and FHB pathogenesis in wheat is investigated. Comprehensive profiling of endogenous hormones demonstrated altered cytokinin, gibberellic acid (GA), and JA metabolism in a FHB-resistant cultivar, whereas challenge by Fusarium graminearum increased abscisic acid (ABA), JA, and SA in both FHB-susceptible and -resistant cultivars. Subsequent investigation of ABA or GA coapplication with fungal challenge increased and decreased FHB spread, respectively. These phytohormones-induced effects may be attributed to alteration of the F. graminearum transcriptome because ABA promoted expression of early-infection genes, including hydrolases and cytoskeletal reorganization genes, while GA suppressed nitrogen metabolic gene expression. Neither ABA nor GA elicited significant effects on F. graminearum fungal growth or sporulation in axenic conditions, nor do these phytohormones affect trichothecene gene expression, deoxynivalenol mycotoxin accumulation, or SA/JA biosynthesis in F. graminearum-challenged wheat spikes. Finally, the combined application of GA and paclobutrazol, a Fusarium fungicide, provided additive effects on reducing FHB severity, highlighting the potential for combining fungicidal agents with select phytohormone-related treatments for management of FHB infection in wheat."

"26834757","abstracttext","NAC transcription factors play diverse roles in plant development and responses to abiotic stresses. However, the biological roles of NAC family members in wheat are not well understood. Here, we reported the isolation and functional characterization of a novel wheat TaNAC47 gene. TaNAC47 encoded protein, localizing in the nucleus, is able to bind to the ABRE cis-element and transactivate transcription in yeast, suggesting that it likely functions as a transcriptional activator. We also showed that TaNAC47 is differentially expressed in different tissues, and its expression was induced by the stress treatments of salt, cold, polyethylene glycol and exogenous abscisic acid. Furthermore, overexpression of TaNAC47 in Arabidopsis resulted in ABA hypersensitivity and enhancing tolerance of transgenic plants to drought, salt, and freezing stresses. Strikingly, overexpression of TaNAC47 was found to activate the expression of downstream genes and change several physiological indices that may enable transgenic plants to overcome unfavorable environments. Taken together, these results uncovered an important role of wheat TaNAC47 gene in response to ABA and abiotic stresses."

"29158546","abstracttext","Wheat is an important global crop with an extremely large and complex genome that contains more transposable elements (TEs) than any other known crop species. Here, we generated a chromosome-scale, high-quality reference genome of Aegilops tauschii, the donor of the wheat D genome, in which 92.5% sequences have been anchored to chromosomes. Using this assembly, we accurately characterized genic loci, gene expression, pseudogenes, methylation, recombination ratios, microRNAs and especially TEs on chromosomes. In addition to the discovery of a wave of very recent gene duplications, we detected that TEs occurred in about half of the genes, and found that such genes are expressed at lower levels than those without TEs, presumably because of their elevated methylation levels. We mapped all wheat molecular markers and constructed a high-resolution integrated genetic map corresponding to genome sequences, thereby placing previously detected agronomically important genes/quantitative trait lociÂ (QTLs) on the Ae. tauschii genome for the first time."

The accessions were also genotyped with 23Â ISSR, nine IRAP and 20Â REMAP markers, generating a total of 658Â clear and scorable bands, 86% of which were polymorphic. Both neighbor-joining dendrogram and Bayesian analysis of clustering of individuals revealed that the accessions could be divided into four genetically distinct groups, indicating the presence of a population structure in current wheat germplasm. Associations between molecular markers and 18Â agronomic traits were analyzed using the mixed linear model (MLM) approach. A total of 94Â loci were found to be significantly associated with agronomic traits (Pâ¤0.01). The highest number of bands significantly associated with the 18Â traits varied from 11 for number of spikelets spike -1 (NSS) to two for grain yield in row (GRY). Loci ISSR16-9 and REMAP13-10 were associated with three different traits. The results of the current study provide useful information about the performance of retrotransposon-based and ISSR molecular markers that could be helpful in selecting potentially elite gene bank samples for wheat-breeding programs."

"28455374","abstracttext","The advantages of free threshing in wheat led to the selection of the domesticated Q allele, which is now present in almost all modern wheat varieties. Q and the pre-domestication allele, q , encode an AP2 transcription factor, with the domesticated allele conferring a free-threshing character and a subcompact (i.e. partially compact) inflorescence (spike). We demonstrate that mutations in the miR172 binding site of the Q gene are sufficient to increase transcript levels via a reduction in miRNA-dependent degradation, consistent with the conclusion that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the miRNA binding site of Q relative to q was essential in defining the modern Q allele. We describe novel gain- and loss-of-function alleles of Q and use these to define new roles for this gene in spike development. Q is required for the suppression of 'sham ramification', and increased Q expression can lead to the formation of ectopic florets and spikelets (specialized inflorescence branches that bear florets and grains), resulting in a deviation from the canonical spike and spikelet structures of domesticated wheat."

"28485207","abstracttext","The binding sites of transcription factors (TFs) in upstream DNA regions are called transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). TFBSs are important elements for regulating gene expression. To date, there have been few studies on the profiles of TFBSs in plants. In total, 4,873 sequences with 5' upstream regions from 8530 wheat fl-cDNA sequences were used to predict TFBSs. We found 4572 TFBSs for the MADS TF family, which was twice as many as for bHLH (1951), B3 (1951), HB superfamily (1914), ERF (1820), and AP2/ERF (1725) TFs, and was approximately four times higher than the remaining TFBS types. The percentage of TFBSs and TF members showed a distinct distribution in different tissues. Overall, the distribution of TFBSs in the upstream regions of wheat fl-cDNA sequences had significant difference. Meanwhile, high frequencies of some types of TFBSs were found in specific regions in the upstream sequences. Both TFs and fl-cDNA with TFBSs predicted in the same tissues exhibited specific distribution preferences for regulating gene expression. The tissue-specific analysis of TFs and fl-cDNA with TFBSs provides useful information for functional research, and can be used to identify relationships between tissue-specific TFs and fl-cDNA with TFBSs. Moreover, the positional distribution of TFBSs indicates that some types of wheat TFBS have different positional distribution preferences in the upstream regions of genes."

"28446328","abstracttext","Introduction of durable resistance genes in crops is an important strategy to prevent yield loss caused by pathogens. The durable multi-pathogen resistance gene Lr34 originating from wheat is widely used in breeding, and is functionally transferable to barley and rice. The molecular resistance mechanism of Lr34, encoding for an adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter, is not known yet. To understand the molecular function and the defense response of durable disease resistance in cereals, the metabolic response of Lr34 was investigated in, except for the Lr34 gene, genetically identical lines of barley, rice and wheat. A broad range of compounds including primary, secondary and lipophilic metabolites were analyzed by a combination of gas (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC) mass spectrometry (MS) based methods. Data from metabolomics correlated well with transcriptomics data for plant defense responses such as the formation of anti-fungal hordatines or the components of the glyoxylate cycle. Induction of the glyoxylate cycle found in transgenic Lr34 rice grown in the greenhouse was confirmed in field-grown natural Lr34 wheat. Constitutively active plant defense responses were observed in the different cereals."

"28536588","abstracttext","The group C-bZIP transcription factors (TFs) are involved in diverse biological processes, such as the regulation of seed storage protein (SSP) production and the responses to pathogen challenge and abiotic stress. However, our knowledge of the abiotic functions of group C-bZIP genes in wheat remains limited. Here, we present the function of a novel TabZIP14-B gene in wheat. This gene belongs to the group C-bZIP TFs and contains six exons and five introns; three haplotypes were identified among accessions of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. A subcellular localization analysis indicated that TabZIP14-B was targeted to the nucleus of tobacco epidermal cells. A transactivation assay demonstrated that TabZIP14-B showed transcriptional activation ability and was capable of binding the abscisic acid (ABA) responsive element (ABRE) in yeast. RT-qPCR revealed that TabZIP14-B was expressed in the roots, stems, leaves, and young spikes and was up-regulated by exogenous ABA, salt, low-temperature, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) stress treatments. Furthermore, Arabidopsis plants overexpressing TabZIP14-B exhibited enhanced tolerance to salt, freezing stresses and ABA sensitivity. Overexpression of TabZIP14-B resulted in increased expression of the AtRD29A , AtCOR47 , AtRD20 , AtGSTF6 , and AtRAB18 genes and changes in several physiological characteristics. These results suggest that TabZIP14-B could function as a positive regulator in mediating the abiotic stress response."

"27726498","abstracttext","Sharp eyespot on wheat is caused by Rhizoctonia cerealis anastomosis group D subgroup I (AG-DI) and is an economically important stem-base disease of wheat in temperate regions worldwide. However, the understanding about the field population structure of R. cerealis is limited. In this study, the genetic structure of four wheat-infecting populations in China was investigated using six microsatellite markers characterized from the transcriptome data of R. cerealis AG-DI. A total of 173 unique genotypes were identified among 235 fungal isolates. Departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, a significant degree of inbreeding, and a significant deficit in heterozygotes indicated a nonrandom mating pattern. Combining the low to intermediate degrees of gametic disequilibrium, although with high genotypic diversity and low to moderate clonal fractions, sexual reproduction probably existed, but the asexual reproduction should be the predominant reproductive mode. Structural analysis showed three gene pools among the four populations, which indicated the existence of three evolutionary origins of R. cerealis AG-DI. The long-distance movement of contaminated material, especially the infected seed, might have caused the moderate gene flow among these populations, which was consistent with the high differentiation among these populations. Overall, the genetic characteristics of the populations suggested a moderate evolutionary potential for R. cerealis AG-DI in China."

Here, we demonstrate a carotenoid producing halotolerant PGPR Dietzia natronolimnaea STR1 protecting wheat plants from salt stress by modulating the transcriptional machinery responsible for salinity tolerance in plants. The expression studies confirmed the involvement of ABA-signalling cascade, as TaABARE and TaOPR1 were upregulated in PGPR inoculated plants leading to induction of TaMYB and TaWRKY expression followed by stimulation of expression of a plethora of stress related genes. Enhanced expression of TaST, a salt stress-induced gene, associated with promoting salinity tolerance was observed in PGPR inoculated plants in comparison to uninoculated control plants. Expression of SOS pathway related genes (SOS1 and SOS4) was modulated in PGPR-applied wheat shoots and root systems. Tissue-specific responses of ion transporters TaNHX1, TaHAK, and TaHKT1, were observed in PGPR-inoculated plants. The enhanced gene expression of various antioxidant enzymes such as APX, MnSOD, CAT, POD, GPX and GR and higher proline content in PGPR-inoculated wheat plants contributed to increased tolerance to salinity stress. Overall, these results indicate that halotolerant PGPR-mediated salinity tolerance is a complex phenomenon that involves modulation of ABA-signalling, SOS pathway, ion transporters and antioxidant machinery."

"27871149","abstracttext","During the infection of host plants, pathogens can deliver virulence-associated 'effector' proteins to promote plant susceptibility. However, little is known about effector function in the obligate biotrophic pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) that is an important fungal pathogen in wheat production worldwide. Here, they report their findings on an in planta highly induced candidate effector from Pst, PSTha5a23. The PSTha5a23 gene is unique to Pst and shows a low level of intra-species polymorphism. It has a functional N-terminal signal peptide and is translocated to the host cytoplasm after infection. Overexpression of PSTha5a23 in Nicotiana benthamiana was found to suppress the programmed cell death triggered by BAX, PAMP-INF1 and two resistance-related mitogen-activated protein kinases (MKK1 and NPK1). Overexpression of PSTha5a23 in wheat also suppressed pattern-triggered immunity (PTI)-associated callose deposition. In addition, silencing of PSTha5a23 did not change Pst virulence phenotypes; however, overexpression of PSTha5a23 significantly enhanced Pst virulence in wheat. These results indicate that the Pst candidate effector PSTha5a23 plays an important role in plant defense suppression and rust pathogenicity, and also highlight the utility of gene overexpression in plants as a tool for studying effectors from obligate biotrophic pathogens."

"28093843","abstracttext","Bipolaris sorokiniana is the causal agent of multiple diseases on wheat and barley and is the primary constraint to cereal production throughout South Asia. Despite its significance, the molecular basis of disease is poorly understood. To address this, the genomes of three Australian isolates of B. sorokiniana were sequenced and screened for known pathogenicity genes. Sequence analysis revealed that the isolate BRIP10943 harboured the ToxA gene, which has been associated previously with disease in the wheat pathogens Parastagonospora nodorum and Pyrenophora tritici-repentis. Analysis of the regions flanking ToxA within B. sorokiniana revealed that it was embedded within a 12-kb genomic element nearly identical to the corresponding regions in P. nodorum and P. tritici-repentis. A screen of 35 Australian B. sorokiniana isolates confirmed that ToxA was present in 12 isolates. Sequencing of the ToxA genes within these isolates revealed two haplotypes, which differed by a single non-synonymous nucleotide substitution. Pathogenicity assays showed that a B. sorokiniana isolate harbouring ToxA was more virulent on wheat lines that contained the sensitivity gene when compared with a non-ToxA isolate. This work demonstrates that proteins that confer host-specific virulence can be horizontally acquired across multiple species. This acquisition can dramatically increase the virulence of pathogenic strains on susceptible cultivars, which, in an agricultural setting, can have devastating economic and social impacts."

"28004741","abstracttext","Understanding of plant adaptation to abiotic stresses has implications in plant breeding, especially in the context of climate change. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs play a crucial role in gene regulation. Here, wheat plants were exposed to one of the following stresses: continuous light, heat or ultraviolet radiations over five consecutive days and leaf tissues from three biological replicates were harvested at 0, 1, 2, 3, 7 and 10 days after treatment (DAT). A total of 72 small RNA libraries were sequenced on the Illumina platform generating ~524 million reads corresponding to ~129 million distinct tags from which 232 conserved miRNAs were identified. The expression levels of 1, 2 and 79 miRNAs were affected by ultraviolet radiation, continuous light and heat, respectively. Approximately 55% of the differentially expressed miRNAs were downregulated at 0 and 1 DAT including miR398, miR528 and miR156 that control mRNAs involved in activation of signal transduction pathways and flowering. Other putative targets included histone variants and methyltransferases. These results suggest a temporal miRNA-guided post-transcriptional regulation that enables wheat to respond to abiotic stresses, particularly heat. Designing novel wheat breeding strategies such as regulatory gene-based marker assisted selection depends on accurate identification of stress induced miRNAs."

"29323166","abstracttext","Wheat powdery mildew is a severe disease affecting yield and quality. Host resistance was proved to be effective and environment-friendly. Wheat line Subtil is an elite germplasm resource resistant to 28 of 30 tested Bgt isolates. Genetic analysis showed that the powdery mildew resistance in Subtil was conferred by a single dominant gene, temporarily designated PmSub. Using bulked segregant analysis, PmSub was mapped to chromosome arm 5DS, and flanked by the markers Bwm16 and Cfd81/Bwm21 at 5.0 and 0.9âcM, respectively. Allelism tests further confirmed PmSub was allelic with documented Pm2 alleles. Then, homologous sequences of Pm2a related sequence was cloned from Subtil and Chinese Spring. It was completely identical to the reported Pm2a sequence, but significantly different from that of Chinese Spring. A marker SWGI067 was developed based on the sequence divergence of homologous sequence in Subtil and Chinese Spring. SWGI067 was closely linked to PmSub, indicating that the gene PmSub itself was different from the cloned Pm2a related sequence. Meanwhile, Subtil produced significantly different reaction pattern compared with other genotypes with Pm genes at or near Pm2 locus. Therefore, PmSub was most likely a new allele of Pm2. PmSub has opportunities for marker-assisted selecting for high-efficiency wheat improvement."

It hydrolysed xylooligosaccharides and beechwood xylan yielding mainly xylobiose (X 2 ) with a small amount of xylose (X 1 ), indicating that XynBT21 was probably an endo-acting xylanase. Enzymatic hydrolysis using wheat bran as a substrate revealed that xylanase reported here has the potential to produce xylobiose from wheat bran. Xylooligosaccharides, especially xylobiose, have strong bifidogenic properties and are increasingly used as a prebiotic. This is the ï¬rst report that describes this novel xylanase enzyme from marine B. tequilensis BT21 used for the release of xylobiose from wheat bran."

"32289637","abstracttext","Acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS, E.C. 2.2.1.6) is the target site of several herbicide classes including imidazolinones. Imidazolinone resistance in wheat is conferred by two major genes AhasL-D1 and AhasL-B1. The objective of this work was to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo AHAS activity and plant growth in response to imazamox of nine wheat cultivars. Dose-response curves for two-gene resistant cultivars were significantly different from the single-gene resistant and susceptible cultivars in the in vitro AHAS assay. Resistance levels at the in vivo AHAS and whole-plant assays for resistant cultivars were >10-fold higher than susceptible cultivars. Moreover, in vivo dose-response curves showed differences among cultivars with the same number of resistance genes. It was concluded that in the in vitro AHAS assay cultivar variability was due to differences in target-site sensitivity while the in vivo AHAS assay reflected the resistance at whole-plant level. Both in vitro and in vivo AHAS dose-response curves could be useful tools when exploring mechanisms involved in imidazolinone resistance in different wheat genetic backgrounds and for the selection of higher resistant genotypes."

"32451599","abstracttext_key message","A new spot blotch (Bipolaris sorokiniana) resistance gene Sb4 was mapped in a genomic interval of 1.34Â Mb on wheat chromosome 4BL. Spot blotch, caused by Bipolaris sorokiniana, has emerged as a serious concern for cultivation of wheat in warmer and humid regions of the world, which results in substantial yield losses and descends with quality. In this study, we identified and mapped a spot blotch resistance gene, designated as Sb4, against B. sorokiniana in wheat. Bulked segregant RNA-Seq (BSR-Seq) analysis and single-nucleotide polymorphism mapping showed that Sb4 is located on the long arm of chromosome 4B. A genetic linkage map of Sb4 was constructed using an F 4 mapping population developed from the cross between 'GY17' and 'Zhongyu1211,' and Sb4 was delimited in a 7.14-cM genetic region on 4BL between markers B6811 and B6901. Using the Chinese Spring reference sequences of chromosome arm 4BL, 13 new polymorphic markers were developed. Finally, Sb4 was mapped in a 1.19-cM genetic interval corresponding to a 1.34-Mb physical genomic region of Chinese Spring chromosome 4BL containing 21 predicted genes. This study provides a foundational step for further cloning of Sb4 using a map-based approach."

"30572265","abstracttext","Alternaria spp. are major contaminants of wheat crops, causing both economic losses for producers and health risk for consumers due to the accumulation of toxic metabolites. The application of synthetic fungicides in the field may trigger mycotoxin accumulation, since fungistatic levels of those compounds might cause fungal responses to stress. Hence, new alternatives are needed for its control. The aim of this work was to compare the effects of a natural antifungal compound, the antifungal protein PgAFP, and a synthetic commercial one, on Alternaria tenuissima sp.-grp. growth, mycotoxin biosynthesis (tenuazonic acid and alternariols) and the expression of a stress-related gene associated with cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway, in a wheat-based medium at two water activities (a w ; 0.95 and 0.98 a w ) conditions associated with the ripening of this grain. The application of both antifungals produced comparable fungistatic effects on Alternaria spp. growth. However, the presence of PgAFP produced a significant reduction in mycotoxins accumulation, whereas this effect was not observed with the commercial antifungal. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the influence of fungicides on the expression of a key gene involved in CWI stress-related pathway in relation to Alternaria mycotoxins accumulation. This information is useful when developing new antifungal methods for foods. The application of PgAFP would be a promising natural strategy for its application in wheat for the control of Alternaria spp."

"30384458","abstracttext","Nitrogen fertilizer is a critical determinant of grain yield and seed quality in wheat. However, the mechanism of nitrogen level during seed production affecting wheat seed vigor and seedling establishment at the transcriptome level remains unknown. Here, we report that wheat seeds produced under different nitrogen levels (N0, N168, N240, and N300) showed significant differences in seed vigor and seedling establishment. In grain yield and seed vigor, N0 and N240 treatments showed the minimum and maximum, respectively. Subsequently, we used RNA-seq to analyze the transcriptomes of seeds and seedlings under N0 and N240 at the early stage of seedling establishment. Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis revealed that dioxygenase-activity-related genes were dramatically upregulated in faster growing seedlings. Among these genes, the top three involved linoleate 9S-lipoxygenase ( Traes_2DL_D4BCDAA76 , Traes_2DL_CE85DC5C0 , and Traes_2DL_B5B62EE11 ). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed that pathways involved in nutrient mobilization and the antioxidant system showed enhanced expression under N240. Moreover, seeds with faster growing seedlings had a higher gene expression level of Î±-amylase, which was consistent with Î±-amylase activity. Taken together, we propose a model for seedling establishment and seed vigor in response to nitrogen level during seed production."

"30387683","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat worldwide. The disease is most preferably managed by developing and growing cultivars with high-level, durable resistance. To achieve high-level and long-lasting resistance, we developed a wheat line, RIL-Yr64/Yr15, by pyramiding Yr64 and Yr15, both on the chromosome 1BS and providing high resistance to all tested Pst races. To validate RIL-Yr64/Yr15 possessing both genes, we crossed it to Avocet S (AvS). The F 4 RILs from this cross were phenotyped with Pst races under controlled greenhouse conditions and also under natural Pst infection in the field. The population was genotyped with SSR markers previously reported to be linked to the resistance gene loci and with additional SSR and SNP-KASP markers along chromosome 1B. Both phenotype and genotype data confirmed the copresence of Yr64 and Yr15 in RIL-Yr64/Yr15, and the high-resolution linkage map dissected the chromosomal regions and traced their origins. New lines possessing these genes were selected from the F 5 population of cross AvS Ã RIL-Yr64/Yr15 by marker-assisted selection. These lines with the two highly effective genes should be more useful than individual gene lines for developing high-level, durable resistant wheat cultivars."

"30456222","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is a major global pathogen of cereals and is considered the main causal agent of Fusarium head blight disease in wheat. Infection with Fusarium graminearum causes a significant reduction in crop yield and quality; therefore, it is very important to improve wheat pathogen resistance. In the present study, the plasmid pAHCht-2 harboring the rice chitinase ( Cht-2 ) gene for pathogen resistance and the plasmid pAB6 containing the gus reporter and bar selectable marker genes were used for genetic transformation of immature embryo-derived calli of the Egyptian wheat cultivar Giza 164 using particle bombardment. Associated changes in defense mechanisms in the transgenic plants were investigated. The transgenic plants had significantly decreased total protein content, phenolic compounds and antioxidant enzyme activities (peroxidase and catalase), and significantly increased phenylalanine ammonia lyase and chitinase activities compared with non-transgenic plants under biotic stress conditions caused by F. graminearum infection. Our results show that activating a specific program of gene expression related to environmental stress conditions can reduce the cost of the stress on plant metabolism."

"31017568","abstracttext","Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV; genus Tritimovirus; family Potyviridae) is an economically important wheat virus that is transmitted by the wheat curl mite (WCM; Aceria tosichella Keifer) in a persistent manner. Virus-vector coevolution may potentially influence vector gene expression to prolong viral association and thus increase virus transmission efficiency and spread. To understand the transcriptomic responses of WCM to WSMV, RNA sequencing was performed to assemble and analyse transcriptomes of WSMV viruliferous and aviruliferous mites. Among 7291 de novo-assembled unigenes, 1020 were differentially expressed between viruliferous and aviruliferous WCMs using edgeR at a false discovery rate â¤0.05. Differentially expressed unigenes were enriched for 108 gene ontology terms, with the majority of the unigenes showing downregulation in viruliferous mites in comparison to only a few unigenes that were upregulated. Protein family and metabolic pathway enrichment analyses revealed that most downregulated unigenes encoded enzymes and proteins linked to stress response, immunity and development. Mechanistically, these predicted changes in mite physiology induced by viral association could be suggestive of pathways needed for promoting virus-vector interactions. Overall, our data suggest that transcriptional changes in viruliferous mites facilitate prolonged viral association and alter WCM development to expedite population expansion, both of which could enhance viral transmission."

"31480315","abstracttext","The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been successfully used in hexaploid wheat. Although it has been reported that the induced mutations can be passed to the next generation, gene editing and transmission patterns in later generations still need to be studied. In this study, we demonstrated that the CRISPR/Cas9 system could achieve efficient mutagenesis in five wheat genes via Agrobacterium -mediated transformation of an sgRNA targeting the D genome, an sgRNA targeting both the A and B homologues and three tri-genome guides targeting the editing of all three homologues. High mutation rates and putative homozygous or biallelic mutations were observed in the T0 plants. The targeted mutations could be stably inherited by the next generation, and the editing efficiency of each mutant line increased significantly across generations. The editing types and inheritance of targeted mutagenesis were similar, which were not related to the targeted subgenome number. The presence of Cas9/sgRNA could cause new mutations in subsequent generations, while mutated lines without Cas9/sgRNA could retain the mutation type. Additionally, off-target mutations were not found in sequences that were highly homologous to the selected sgRNA sequences. Overall, the results suggested that CRISPR/Cas9-induced gene editing via Agrobacterium -mediated transformation plays important roles in wheat genome engineering."

"31616457","abstracttext","Increased thousand-grain weight (TGW) is an important breeding target for indirectly improving grain yield (GY). Fourteen reported candidate genes known to enhance TGW were evaluated in two independent and existing datasets of wheat at CIMMYT, the Elite Yield Trial (EYT) from 2015 to 2016 (EYT2015-16) and the Wheat Association Mapping Initiative (WAMI) panel, to study their allele effects on TGW and to verify their suitability for marker-assisted selection. Of these, significant associations were detected for only one gene ( TaGs3-D1 ) in the EYT2015-16 and two genes ( TaTGW6 and TaSus1 ) in WAMI. The reported favorable alleles of TaGs3-D1 and TaTGW6 genes decreased TGW in the datasets. A haplotype-based genome wide association study was implemented to identify the genetic determinants of TGW on a large set of CIMMYT germplasm (4,302 lines comprising five EYTs), which identified 15 haplotype blocks to be significantly associated with TGW. Four of them, identified on chromosomes 4A, 6A, and 7A, were associated with TGW in at least three EYTs. The locus on chromosome 6A (Hap-6A-13) had the largest effect on TGW and additionally GY with increases of up to 2.60 g and 258 kg/ha, respectively. Discovery of novel TGW loci described in our study expands the opportunities for developing diagnostic markers and for multi-gene pyramiding to derive new allele combinations for enhanced TGW and GY in CIMMYT wheat."

"33180704","abstracttext","The MYB transcription factor family is important for plant responses to abiotic stresses. In this study, we identified three wheat TaMYB86 genes encoding R2R3-type MYB transcription factors. Analyses of the phylogenetic relationships and gene structures of TaMYB86A, TaMYB86B, and TaMYB86D revealed considerable similarities in gene structures and the encoded amino acid sequences. Additionally, TaMYB86B was highly expressed in the roots, stems, and leaves, suggesting it is critical for regulating salt stress responses in wheat. Moreover, TaMYB86B expression was induced by NaCl, abscisic acid (ABA), methyl jasmonate (MeJA), gibberellin (GA), auxin and low temperature treatments. The TaMYB86B protein localized in the nucleus and exhibited transcriptional activation activity. Under salt stress, TaMYB86B-overexpressing plants had a higher biomass and potassium ion (K + ) content, but lower MDA, H 2 O 2 , O 2 -. , and sodium ion (Na + ) contents, when compared with the wild-type plants. Quantitative real-time PCR results indicated that the overexpression of TaMYB86B improved the expression of many stress-related genes. These findings suggest that TaMYB86B influences the salt tolerance of wheat by regulating the ion homeostasis to maintain an appropriate osmotic balance and decrease ROS levels."

"18040656","abstracttext","The transition from vegetative to floral meristems in higher plants is determined by the coincidence of internal and environmental signals. Contrary to the photoperiod pathway, convergent evolution of the cold-dependent pathway has implicated different genes between dicots and monocots. Whereas no association between natural variation in vernalization requirement and Flowering time locus T (FT) gene polymorphism has been described in Arabidopsis, recent studies in Triticeae suggest implication of orthologous copies of FT in the cold response. In our study, we show that nucleotide polymorphisms on A and D copies of the wheat FT gene were associated with variations for heading date in a collection of 239 lines representing diverse geographical origins and status (landraces, old or recent cultivars). Interestingly, polymorphisms in the non-coding intronic region were strongly associated to flowering variation observed on plants grown without vernalization. But differently from VRN1, no epistatic interaction between FT homeologous copies was revealed. In agreement with the results of association study, the A and D copies of FT were mapped in regions including major QTLs for earliness traits in hexaploid wheat. This work, by identifying additional homeoalleles involved in wheat vernalization pathway, will contribute to a better understanding of the control of flowering, hence providing tools for the breeding of varieties with enhanced adaptation to changing environments."

"25496594","abstracttext","Chloroplasts have a critical role in plant defense as sites for the biosynthesis of the signaling compounds salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), and nitric oxide (NO) and as major sites of reactive oxygen species production. Chloroplasts, therefore, regarded as important players in the induction and regulation of programmed cell death (PCD) in response to abiotic stresses and pathogen attack. The predominantly foliar pathogen of wheat Zymoseptoria tritici is proposed to exploit the plant PCD, which is associated with the transition in the fungus to the necrotrophic phase of infection. In this study virus-induced gene silencing was used to silence two key genes in carotenoid and chlorophyll biosynthesis, phytoene desaturase (PDS) and Mg-chelatase H subunit (ChlH). The chlorophyll-deficient, PDS- and ChlH-silenced leaves of susceptible plants underwent more rapid pathogen-induced PCD but were significantly less able to support the subsequent asexual sporulation of Z. tritici. Conversely, major gene (Stb6)-mediated resistance to Z. tritici was partially compromised in PDS- and ChlH-silenced leaves. Chlorophyll-deficient wheat ears also displayed increased Z. tritici disease lesion formation accompanied by increased asexual sporulation. These data highlight the importance of chloroplast functionality and its interaction with regulated plant cell death in mediating different genotype and tissue-specific interactions between Z. tritici and wheat."

All positive isolates were tested for their ability to biosynthesize BEA and ENs in vitro. In addition, all wheat samples were investigated for the natural presence of BEA and ENs (ENA, ENA1, ENB, ENB1). All FA and FP strains resulted to be positive for the presence of the esyn1 gene. All FA strains showed the ability to biosynthesize ENs in vitro but not BEA. Conversely, all FP strains resulted to be BEA producers and some of them co-biosynthesized ENs. A remarkable presence of ""emerging"" mycotoxins was found in the grains, particularly ENs. Co-contamination by BEA and ENs also occurred. This study gives an important contribution to assess the risk posed by mycotoxigenic fungi and their mycotoxins in food."

"25707852","abstracttext","Vernalization requirement is an important characteristic in crop breeding. Wheat is a widely grown crop in the world that possesses enormous economic significance. To better understand the gene networks in vernalization process, we performed a high-throughput RNA sequencing analysis comparing the transcriptomes of spring and winter wheat cultivars, with and without vernalization (unpublished data). In this study, we selected six unigenes (CL14010, CL12788, CL176, Unigene 16777, CL8746 and Unigene10196) from our transcriptome analysis based on their expression differences to further characterize their function. Transient silencing of the six unigenes individually were achieved through virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) using BSMV vector. The period from germination to spike differentiation were recorded and compared between plants underwent VIGS silencing and the control. Our result showed that VIGS of the six unigenes significantly shortened the period from seedling to double ridge (DR) stage. Resulting in SD period ranging from 59.8 Â± 0.60 to 65.8 Â± 0.48 days, compared to 85.0 Â± 0.73 days in the control. The results indicated that these six unigenes function as suppressors in vernalization process and silence or down-regulation of these genes promoted flower development in wheat. Further characterization of these six unigenes and their function in vernalization and flowering control is needed."

Here we show that four putative WAKs (TaWAK1, TaWAKL2, TaWAKL3, and TaWAK4) and two WAKLs (TaWAKL1 and TaWAKL2) were isolated from wheat based on the DNA sequence similarity and the protein structure conservation of Arabidopsis WAKs genes. TaWAK1, TaWAK2, TaWAK3 and TaWAKL1 each encode a putative intact protein with the characteristic of the WAKâ/âWAKL gene family members, except for the abbreviated TaWAK4 and TaWAKL2 which were caused by nucleotide mutation and alternative splicing, respectively. Southern analysis revealed that TaWAKL1, TaWAK1, TaWAK2 and TaWAK3 are all multiple-copy members. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the TaWAK1 and TaWAK3 displayed similar expression patterns, while expressions of TaWAKL1, TaWAKL2, and TaWAK2 were organ specific.

"33255795","abstracttext","Polyploidization has played a prominent role in the evolutionary history of plants. Two recent and sequential allopolyploidization events have resulted in the formation of wheat species with different ploidies, and which provide a model to study the effects of polyploidization on the evolution of gene expression. In this study, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between four BBAA tetraploid wheats of three different ploidy backgrounds. DEGs were found to be unevenly distributed among functional categories and duplication modes. We observed more DEGs in the extracted tetraploid wheat (ETW) than in natural tetraploid wheats (TD and TTR13) as compared to a synthetic tetraploid (AT2). Furthermore, DEGs showed higher Ka/Ks ratios than those that did not show expression changes (non-DEGs) between genotypes, indicating DEGs and non-DEGs experienced different selection pressures. For A-B homeolog pairs with DEGs, most of them had only one differentially expressed copy, however, when both copies of a homeolog pair were DEGs, the A and B copies were more likely to be regulated to the same direction. Our results suggest that both cis - and inter-subgenome trans -regulatory changes are important drivers in the evolution of homeologous gene expression in polyploid wheat, with ploidy playing a significant role in the process."

The objective of this study was to localize the scs(ti) gene on a linkage map of chromosome 1A, which could eventually be used to clone the gene. The mapping population consisted of 110 F2 individuals derived from crossing a Langdon-T. dicoccoides chromosome 1A substitution line with a euplasmic (normal cytoplasm) line homozygous for the scs(ti) gene. Through a series of testcrosses the genotypes of the 110 individuals were determined: 22 had two copies, 59 had one copy, and 29 had no copy of the scs(ti) gene. Data from RFLP, AFLP, and microsatellite analysis were used to create a linkage map. The flanking marker loci found for the scs(ti) gene were Xbcd12 and Xbcd1449-1A.2 with distances of 2.3 and 0.6 cM, respectively. Nearly 10% of individuals in this population were double recombinant for a genetic interval of <3 cM. A blistering phenotype reminiscent of the phenotype observed in maize brittle-1 mutable was also evident in these individuals. The higher frequency of double recombination within this region and seed-blistering phenotype could be an indication of a transposable element(s) in this locus."

The collection of seed material was made using a spatial hierarchical sampling design in which four collection sites were 5-7 m apart, four were 15-17 m apart, and four were 100-120 m apart. Between 25 and 30 plants were scored from each site (mean sample size = 28.7). Two procedures for indirect estimation of gene flow were used on gene-frequency data from 13 polymorphic loci. The estimates of Nm using Wright's (1943a, 1943b) estimation procedure were 1.265, 0.212, and 0.357, for the closest, intermediate, and most distant distance classes, respectively. The estimates of Nm using Slatkin's (1985) private-allele procedure were 4.675 (subsample ranges: 1.544-4.675), 0.110 (subsample ranges: 0.069-0.153), and 0.670 (subsample ranges: 0.129-0.256). The results indicate a general agreement between the two procedures. Both indicate a sharp decrease in gene flow beyond the first distance class (5-7 m). The large gene-flow values and the large variation within the 5-7-m distance class are taken as evidence that a genetic neighborhood for this species may cover an area defined by a 5-m radius. The results also indicate that gene flow between populations separated by only 10 or more meters may be quite limited."

We also detected the positive selection of PRX domain in 13 PRXs involving our evolutionary model, and found 2 or 6 positively selected sites during TaPRX-2A evolution. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) results showed that TaPRX-2A exhibited relatively higher expression levels in root tissue than those exhibited in leaf and stem tissues. TaPRX-2A expression was also induced by abiotic stresses and hormone treatments such as polyethylene glycol 6000, NaCl, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), salicylic acid (SA), methyljasmonic acid (MeJA) and abscisic acid (ABA). Transgenic wheat plants with overexpression of TaPRX-2A showed higher tolerance to salt stress than wild-type (WT) plants. Confocal microscopy revealed that TaPRX-2A-eGFP was mainly localized in cell nuclei. Survival rate, relative water content, and shoot length were higher in TaPRX-2A-overexpressing wheat than in the WT wheat, whereas root length was not significantly different. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) were enhanced in TaPRX-2A-overexpressing wheat compared with those in the WT wheat, resulting in the reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and malondialdehyde (MDA) content.

In monosomic lines, wheat chromosomes 1A, 2A, 5A, 6A, 7A and 5B paired with rye homoeologues most often in rod bivalents and in chain quadrivalents (also including 3B). The 47% pairing of 5B-5R chromosomes indicate that the rye genomes block the suppressor Ph1 gene activity. In monosomic plants with chromosomes 5A, 2A, 6A, 7A and 5B, a low frequency of rye univalents was observed. It was also found that the wheat chromosomes influenced the pairing of rye genome chromosomes, as well as the frequency of ring and rod bivalents and tri- and quadrivalents. However, the highest number of terminal chiasmata per chromosome occurred in the presence of chromosomes 5A and 2A, and the lowest - in the presence of chromosomes 3B and 7B. In the presence of chromosome 5B, the highest frequency of bivalents was observed. The results of the present study show that the rye genome is closer related to the wheat genome A of than to genome B. The high pairing of wheat-rye chromosomes, which occurs in tetraploid rye with substitution wheat chromosomes, indicates that there is a high probability of incorporating wheat chromosome segments into rye chromosomes."

"18392559","abstracttext","Genetic diversity of a set of 71 wheat accessions, including 53 biotype 2 Russian wheat aphid (RWA2)-resistant landraces and 18 RWA2 susceptible accessions, was assessed by examining molecular variation at multiple microsatellite (SSR) loci. Fifty-one wheat SSR primer pairs were used, 81 SSR loci were determined, and 545 SSR alleles were detected. These SSR loci covered all the three genomes, 21 chromosomes, and at least 41 of the 42 chromosome arms. Diversity values averaged over SSR loci were high with mean number of SSR alleles/locus = 6.7, mean Shannon's index (H) = 1.291, and mean Nei's gene diversity (He) = 0.609. The three wheat genomes ranked as A > D > B and the homoeologous groups ranked as 7 > 3 > 1 > 2 > 6 > 5 > 4 based on the number of alleles per locus. Xgwm136 on chromosome arm 1AS is the most polymorphic SSR locus with the largest number of observed and effective alleles and the highest H and He. Among all 2485 pairs of wheat accessions, genetic distance (GD) ranged from 0.054 to 1.933 and averaged 0.9832. A dendrogram based on GD matrix showed that all the wheat accessions could be grouped into distinct clusters. Most of the susceptible cultivars (13/18) were clustered into groups that contains all or mostly susceptible accessions. Most of the U.S. cultivars belong to a group that is distinguishable from all the different RWA2 resistant groups. Diversity analysis was also conducted separately for subgroups containing 53 RWA2-resistant accessions and 18 RWA2-susceptible accessions. Association mapping revealed 28 SSR loci significantly associated with leaf chlorosis, and 8 with leaf rolling. New chromosome regions associated with RWA2 resistance were detected, and indicated existence of new RWA resistance genes located on chromosomes of all other homoeologous groups in addition to the groups 1 and 7 in bread wheat. This information is helpful for development of mapping populations for RWA2 resistance genes from different phylogenetic groups, and for wise utilization of the RWA-resistant germplasm in wheat breeding programs."
"17216545","articletitle","A wheat genomic DNA fragment reduces pollen transmission of maize transgenes by reducing pollen viability."
"17216545","abstracttext","A genomic DNA fragment from wheat carrying the Glu-1Dx5 gene has been shown to exhibit reduced pollen transmission in transgenic maize. To localize the region of the DNA fragment responsible for this reduced pollen transmission, we produced transgenic maize plants in which the wheat genomic DNA proximal to the 1Dx5 coding sequence was replaced with the maize 27 kDa gamma-zein promoter. Like the wheat promoter-driven Glu-1Dx5 transgene, this zein promoter-driven transgene functioned to produce 1Dx5 in maize endosperm. However, with the zein promoter-driven transgene, pollen transmission of the transgene loci was normal in most self- and cross-pollinations. We concluded that the wheat genomic DNA proximal to the wheat 1Dx5 coding sequence was required for reduced pollen transmission of the transgene in maize. In two of four transformation events of the wheat promoter-driven construct examined, pollen exhibited two morphological classes. In one class, pollen was normal in morphology and displayed average viability, and in the second, pollen was reduced in size and did not germinate on artificial media. DNA from the transgene was detectable in mature pollen from plants with reduced pollen transmission of transgene loci. To explain these observations, we hypothesize that elements within the transgene construct interfere with pollen development. We demonstrated that the wheat genomic DNA fragment can be used to control pollen transmission of an herbicide resistance transgene genetically linked to it. The wheat genomic DNA fragment may contain elements that are useful for controlling pollen transmission of transgene loci in commercial maize grain and seed production."

My8443, a wheat cultivars infecting seriously powdery mildew disease, was used as the female parent and Weiling rye was used as the donor of powdery mildew resistance in the study. A new wheat-rye translocation line,named No.147,was developed from BC2F6 progenies of wheat cultivars My8443 and Weiling rye to transfer the resistance from Weiling rye to common wheat. The powdery mildew resistance of No.147 and its parents were investigated in seedling and adult stages by artificially inoculating the mixture of advanced pathogenic races in room and field and the single pathogenic race in room. Improved Giemsa C-banding technique and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH,Genomic in situ hybridization) were used to identify wheat and rye chromosomes. Acid polyacylamide gel electrophoresis(APAGE) separation of endosperm gliadin and simple sequence repeat(SSR) PCR amplification of 11 SCM-Secale cereale markers also were employed for 1RS confirmation in the study. The results showed that No.147 was a new 1BL/1RS wheat-rye chromosome translocation with high powdery mildew resistance derived from Weiling rye. The reason on the formation of the new wheat-rye chromosome translocation was analyzed. The utilizations of resistance gene resource derived from Chinese Weiling rye and the new 1BL/1RS translocation line in wheat genetics and breeding improvement were discussed in the paper."

"22850788","abstracttext","Grain protein content in wheat has been shown to be affected by the NAM-B1 gene where the wildtype allele confers high levels of protein and micronutrients but can reduce yield. Two known non-functional alleles instead increase yield but lead to lower levels of protein and micronutrients. The wildtype allele in hexaploid bread wheat is so far mainly known from historical specimens and a few lines with an emmer wheat introgression. Here we report a screening for the wildtype allele in wheats of different origin. First, a worldwide core collection of 367 bread wheats with worldwide origin was screened and five accessions carrying the wildtype NAM-B1 allele were found. Several of these could be traced to a Fennoscandian origin and the wildtype allele was more frequent in spring wheat. These findings, together with the late maturation of spring wheat, suggested that the faster maturation caused by the wildtype allele might have preserved it in areas with a short growing season. Thus a second set consisting of 138 spring wheats of a northern origin was screened and as many as 33 % of the accessions had the wildtype allele, all of a Fennoscandian origin. The presence of the wildtype allele in landraces and cultivars is in agreement with the use of landraces in Fennoscandian wheat breeding. Last, 22 spelt wheats, a wheat type previously suggested to carry the wildtype allele, were screened and five wildtype accessions found. The wildtype NAM-B1 accessions found could be a suitable material for plant breeding efforts directed towards increasing the nutrient content of bread wheat."

In Middle Europe, wheat straw is one of the most abundant low-cost sources of lignocellulosic biomass. For its efficient use, an efficient mix of cellulases and hemicellulases is required. In this paper, we investigated how cellulase production by T. reesei on wheat straw compares to that on lactose, the only soluble and also cheap inducing carbon source for enzyme production."
"24016404","abstracttext_results","We have examined and compared the transcriptome of T. reesei growing on wheat straw and lactose as carbon sources under otherwise similar conditions. Gene expression on wheat straw exceeded that on lactose, and 1619 genes were found to be only induced on wheat straw but not on lactose. They comprised 30% of the CAZome, but were also enriched in genes associated with phospholipid metabolism, DNA synthesis and repair, iron homeostatis and autophagy. Two thirds of the CAZome was expressed both on wheat straw as well as on lactose, but 60% of it at least >2-fold higher on the former. Major wheat straw specific genes comprised xylanases, chitinases and mannosidases. Interestingly, the latter two CAZyme families were significantly higher expressed in a strain in which xyr1 encoding the major regulator of cellulase and hemicellulase biosynthesis is non-functional."

"24257829","abstracttext","The spontaneous occurrence of chromosome breaks, deletions, and translocations in plant tissue cultures is well documented. This study investigated the usefulness of tissue culture as a method of introgressing alien genes into wheat. Wheat X rye hybrids were regenerated from embryo scutellar calli maintained in culture for 222 days. The regenerated seedlings then were treated with colchicine to produce amphidiploids (AABBDDRR). The karyotypes of ten amphidiploids were analyzed by C-banding to determine chromosome structural changes that occurred during tissue culture. Three wheat/rye and one wheat/wheat chromosome translocations, seven deletions, and five amplifications of heterochromatin bands of rye chromosomes were identified. One amphidiploid contained a reciprocal translocation between wheat chromosome 4D and rye chromosome 1R. Non-reciprocal translocations between 2B and 3R, and between an unidentified wheat chromosome and 2R, were found independently in two amphidiploids. An additional plant had a translocation between wheat chromosomes 6B and 5A. All deletions involving rye chromosomes were noted in all 10 amphidiploids. Twelve of the 13 breakpoints in chromosomes involved in translocations and deletions occurred in heterochromatin. Amplification of heterochromatin bands on 2RL and 7RL chromosome arms also was observed in five plants. These results indicate a high degree of chromosome structural change induced by tissue culture. Therefore, tissue culture may be a useful tool in alien gene introgression and manipulation of heterochromatin in triticale improvement."

"26175740","abstracttext","Wheat stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat worldwide. miRNAs are important regulators, they play very central roles in plant organ development, vegetable phase change and defense responses. In this study, two miRNA libraries from wheat cultivar Xingzi 9104 (XZ) challenged with the avirulent Pst race CYR32 and sterile water were constructed, respectively. A total of 596 miRNA candidates were obtained. 420 wheat-specific candidate miRNAs were screened in adult plants challenged with Pst using microarray-based analyses. We analyzed the abundance of candidate miRNAs, and the levels of a subset of candidate miRNAs were determined by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). The qRT-PCR results indicated that some miRNAs were involved in the incompatible interaction between wheat and Pst. In addition, we identified some miRNAs differentially expressed in different leaves. Additionally, the target genes of wheat miRNAs were confirmed by using degradome sequencing technology. Most of the annotated target genes are related to signal transduction, energy metabolism, and other functions. We selected some target genes for relative expression analysis using qRT-PCR, and found that RabGAP/TBC domain-containing protein, zinc finger protein and Cysteine-rich receptor-like protein kinase 41 may play important role in the incompatible interaction between XZ and CYR32. Intriguingly, miRNAs and target gene seem to form a complicated regulation network that regulates the wheat-Pst interaction. Our data provide the foundation for evaluating the important regulatory roles of miRNAs in the wheat-Pst interaction."

"25806790","abstracttext","Hybrid chlorosis, a type of hybrid incompatibility, has frequently been reported in inter- and intraspecific crosses of allopolyploid wheat. In a previous study, we reported some types of growth abnormalities such as hybrid necrosis and observed hybrid chlorosis with mild or severe abnormalities in wheat triploids obtained in crosses between tetraploid wheat cultivar Langdon and four Ae. tauschii accessions and in their derived synthetic hexaploids. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying hybrid chlorosis are not well understood. Here, we compared cytology and gene expression in leaves to characterize the abnormal growth in wheat synthetics showing mild and severe chlorosis. In addition, we compared disease resistance to wheat blast fungus. In total 55 and 105 genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and 53 and 89 genes for defense responses were markedly up-regulated in the mild and severe chlorosis lines, respectively. Abnormal chloroplasts formed in the mesophyll cells before the leaves yellowed in the hybrid chlorosis lines. The plants with mild chlorosis showed increased resistance to wheat blast and powdery mildew fungi, although significant differences only in two, third internode length and maturation time, out of the examined agricultural traits were found between the wild type and plants showing mild chlorosis. These observations suggest that senescence might be accelerated in hybrid chlorosis lines of wheat synthetics. Moreover, in wheat synthetics showing mild chlorosis, the negative effects on biomass can be minimized, and they may show substantial fitness under pathogen-polluted conditions."

"26875072","abstracttext_key message","Barley resistance to wheat stripe rust has remained effective for a long time and, therefore, the genes underlying this resistance can be a valuable tool to engineer durable resistance in wheat. Wheat stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a major disease of wheat that is causing large economic losses in many wheat-growing regions of the world. Deployment of Pst resistance genes has been an effective strategy for controlling this pathogen, but many of these genes have been defeated by new Pst races. In contrast, genes providing resistance to this wheat pathogen in other grass species (nonhost resistance) have been more durable. Barley varieties (Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare) are predominately immune to wheat Pst, but we identified three accessions of wild barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum) that are susceptible to Pst. Using these accessions, we mapped a barley locus conferring resistance to Pst on the distal region of chromosome arm 7HL and designated it as Rps6. The detection of the same locus in the cultivated barley 'Tamalpais' and in the Chinese barley 'Y12' by an allelism test suggests that Rps6 may be a frequent component of barley intermediate host resistance to Pst. Using a high-density mapping population (>10,000 gametes) we precisely mapped Rps6 within a 0.14Â cM region (~500Â kb contig) that is colinear to regions in Brachypodium (<94Â kb) and rice (<9Â kb). Since no strong candidate gene was identified in these colinear regions, a dedicated positional cloning effort in barley will be required to identify Rps6. The identification of this and other barley genes conferring resistance to Pst can contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms for durable resistance against this devastating wheat pathogen."

Cytological observations suggested that M11003-3-1-15-8 contained 42 chromosomes and formed 21 bivalents at meiotic metaphase I. The GISH investigations showed that line contained 40 wheat chromosomes and a pair of L. mollis chromosomes. EST-STS multiple loci markers and PLUG (PCR-based Landmark Unique Gene) markers confirmed that the introduced L. mollis chromosomes belonged to homoeologous group 7, it was designated as Lm#7Ns. While nulli-tetrasomic and sequential FISH-GISH analysis using the oligonucleotide Oligo-pSc119.2 and Oligo-pTa535 as probes revealed that the wheat 7D chromosomes were absent in M11003-3-1-15-8. Therefore, it was deduced that M11003-3-1-15-8 was a wheat-L. mollis Lm#7Ns (7D) disomic substitution line. Field disease resistance demonstrated that the introduced L. mollis chromosomes Lm#7Ns were responsible for the stripe rust resistance at the adult stage. Moreover, M11003-3-1-15-8 had a superior numbers of florets. The novel disomic substitution line M11003-3-1-15-8, could be exploited as an important genetic material in wheat resistance breeding programs and genetic resources."

"28484474","abstracttext","Drought is a major abiotic stress that limits wheat production worldwide. To ensure food security for the rapidly increasing world population, improving wheat yield under drought stress is urgent and relevant. In this study, an RNA-seq analysis was conducted to study the effect of drought on wheat transcriptome changes during reproductive stages under field conditions. Our results indicated that drought stress during early reproductive periods had a more severe impact on wheat development, gene expression and yield than drought stress during flowering. In total, 115,656 wheat genes were detected, including 309 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) which responded to drought at various developmental stages. These DEGs were involved in many critical processes including floral development, photosynthetic activity and stomatal movement. At early developmental stages, the proteins of drought-responsive DEGs were mainly located in the nucleus, peroxisome, mitochondria, plasma membrane and chloroplast, indicating that these organelles play critical roles in drought tolerance in wheat. Furthermore, the validation of five DEGs confirmed their responsiveness to drought under different genetic backgrounds. Functional verification of DEGs of interest will occur in our subsequent research. Collectively, the results of this study not only advanced our understanding of wheat transcriptome changes under drought stress during early reproductive stages but also provided useful targets to manipulate drought tolerance in wheat at different development stages."

"27582300","abstracttext","Rust fungi of the order Pucciniales are destructive pathogens of wheat worldwide. Leaf rust caused by the obligate, biotrophic basidiomycete fungus Puccinia triticina (Pt) is an economically important disease capable of causing up to 50Â % yield losses. Historically, resistant wheat cultivars have been used to control leaf rust, but genetic resistance is ephemeral and breaks down with the emergence of new virulent Pt races. There is a need to develop alternative measures for control of leaf rust in wheat. Development of transgenic wheat expressing an antifungal defensin offers a promising approach to complement the endogenous resistance genes within the wheat germplasm for durable resistance to Pt. To that end, two different wheat genotypes, Bobwhite and Xin Chun 9 were transformed with a chimeric gene encoding an apoplast-targeted antifungal plant defensin MtDEF4.2 from Medicago truncatula. Transgenic lines from four independent events were further characterized. Homozygous transgenic wheat lines expressing MtDEF4.2 displayed resistance to Pt race MCPSS relative to the non-transgenic controls in growth chamber bioassays. Histopathological analysis suggested the presence of both pre- and posthaustorial resistance to leaf rust in these transgenic lines. MtDEF4.2 did not, however, affect the root colonization of a beneficial arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. This study demonstrates that the expression of apoplast-targeted plant defensin MtDEF4.2 can provide substantial resistance to an economically important leaf rust disease in transgenic wheat without negatively impacting its symbiotic relationship with the beneficial mycorrhizal fungus."

"28258493","abstracttext_main conclusion","Fluorescence in situ hybridization and molecular markers have confirmed that several chromosomes from Thinopyrum intermedium ssp. trichophorum have been added to a wheat background, which originated from a cross between a wheat- Thinopyrum partial amphiploid and triticale. The lines displayed blue grains and resistance to wheat stripe rust. Thinopyrum intermedium has been used as a valuable resource for improving the disease resistance and yield potential of wheat. With the aim to transfer novel genetic variation from Th. intermedium species for sustainable wheat breeding, a new trigeneric hybrid was produced by crossing an octoploid wheat-Th. intermedium ssp. trichophorum partial amphiploid with hexaploid triticale. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed that Thinopyrum chromosomes were transmitted preferably and the number of rye chromosomes tended to decrease gradually in the selfed derivatives of the trigeneric hybrids. Four stable wheat-Th. intermedium chromosome substitution, addition and translocation lines were selected, and a 2J S addition line, two substitution lines of 4J S (4B) and 4J(4B), and a small 4J.4B translocation line were identified by FISH and molecular markers. It was revealed that the gene(s) responsible for blue grains may located on the FL0.60-1.00 of long arm of Th. intermedium-derived 4J chromosome. Disease resistance screenings indicated that chromosomes 4J S and 2J S appear to enhance the resistance to stripe rust in the adult plant stage. The new germplasm with Th. intermedium introgression shows promise for utilization of Thinopyrum chromosome segments in future wheat improvement."

"29051768","abstracttext","Barley is an important crop for the production of malt and beer. However, crops such as rice and wheat are rarely used for malting. Î±-amylase is the key enzyme that degrades starch during malting. In this study, we compared the genomic properties, gene copies, and conserved promoter motifs of Î±-amylase genes in barley, rice, and wheat. In all three crops, Î±-amylase consists of four subfamilies designated amy1, amy2 , amy3 , and amy4 . In wheat and barley, members of amy1 and amy2 genes are localized on chromosomes 6 and 7, respectively. In rice, members of amy1 genes are found on chromosomes 1 and 2, and amy2 genes on chromosome 6. The barley genome has six amy1 members and three amy2 members. The wheat B genome contains four amy1 members and three amy2 members, while the rice genome has three amy1 members and one amy2 member. The B genome has mostly amy1 and amy2 members among the three wheat genomes. Amy1 promoters from all three crop genomes contain a GA-responsive complex consisting of a GA-responsive element (CAATAAA), pyrimidine box (CCTTTT) and TATCCAT/C box. This study has shown that amy1 and amy2 from both wheat and barley have similar genomic properties, including exon/intron structures and GA-responsive elements on promoters, but these differ in rice. Like barley, wheat should have sufficient amy activity to degrade starch completely during malting. Other factors, such as high protein with haze issues and the lack of husk causing Lauting difficulty, may limit the use of wheat for brewing."

"32356579","abstracttext","Wheat contains abundant xylan in cell walls of all tissues, but in endosperm, there is an unusual form of xylan substituted only by arabinose (arabinoxylan; AX) that has long chains and low levels of feruloylation, a fraction of which is extractable in water (WE-AX). WE-AX acts as soluble dietary fibre but also gives rise to viscous extracts from grain, a detrimental trait for some non-food uses of wheat. Here, we show that a glycosyl transferase family 43 wheat gene abundantly expressed in endosperm complements the Arabidopsis irx9 mutant and so name the three homoeologous genes TaIRX9b. We generated wheat lines with a constitutive knockout of TaIRX9b by stacking loss-of-function alleles for these homeologues from a mutagenized hexaploid wheat population resulting in decreases in grain extract viscosity of 50%-80%. The amount and chain length of WE-AX molecules from grain of these triple-stack lines was decreased accounting for the changes in extract viscosity. Imaging of immature wheat grain sections of triple-stacks showed abolition of immunolabelling in endosperm with LM11 antibody that recognizes epitopes in AX, but also showed apparently normal cell size and shape in all cell types, including endosperm. We identified differentially expressed genes from endosperm of triple-stacks suggesting that compensatory changes occur to maintain this endosperm cell wall integrity. Consistent with this, we observed increased ferulate dimerization and increased cross-linking of WE-AX molecules in triple-stacks. These novel wheat lines lacking functional TaIRX9b therefore provide insight into control of wheat endosperm cell walls."

Collections of Puccinia triticina were obtained from rust-infected leaves provided by cooperators throughout the United States and from surveys of wheat fields and nurseries in the Great Plains, Ohio River Valley, southeast, California, and Washington State in order to determine the virulence of the wheat leaf rust population in 2007. Single uredinial isolates (868 in total) were derived from the collections and tested for virulence phenotype on lines of Thatcher wheat that are near-isogenic for leaf rust resistance genes Lr1, Lr2a, Lr2c, Lr3a, Lr9, Lr16, Lr24, Lr26, Lr3ka, Lr11, Lr17a, Lr30, LrB, Lr10, Lr14a, Lr18, Lr21, and Lr28, and on winter wheat lines with genes Lr41 and Lr42. Fifty-two virulence phenotypes were found. Virulence phenotypes TDBJG, MFPSC, and TDBJH were among the four most common phenotypes and were all virulent to resistance gene Lr24. These phenotypes were found throughout the Great Plains region. Phenotype MLDSD, with virulence to Lr9, Lr17, and Lr41, was also widely distributed in the Great Plains.

"30677322","abstracttext","The cereal cyst nematode (CCN, Heterodera avenae), a major limiting factor for wheat production worldwide, is widespread in most wheat-growing regions in China. Accordingly, screening and characterization of resistant (R) wheat sources against H. avenae are very important. In this study, we screened 51 wheat lines, collected from the International Wheat and Maize Improvement Center (CIMMYT), carrying various Cre genes (Cre1, Cre2, Cre3, Cre5, Cre7, Cre8, CreR, and Pt). From that screen, we identified one immune (M) cultivar (with no adult females produced) and five resistant cultivars (with fewer than five females) to H. avenae pathotype Ha91. The Cre3 gene conferred the most effective resistance against H. avenae pathotype Ha91 in both field and greenhouse assays. Conversely, the Cre1 and CreR genes conferred the poorest effective resistance. Using Pluronic F-127 gel and a staining assay, juvenile nematodes invading wheat roots were observed, and nematode development was analyzed. Compared with R and M roots, those of the susceptible (S) wheat cultivar Wenmai19 were more attractive to H. avenae second-stage juveniles (J2s). We observed the retardation of nematode development in R cultivars and tiny white female cysts protruding from the R cultivar VP1620. Nematodes in M roots either disintegrated or remained J2s or third-stage juveniles (J3s) and failed to complete their life cycle. Molting was also suppressed or delayed in R and M genotypes. For both S and R cultivars, syncytia were characterized by cell wall perforations and dense cytoplasm in hypertrophied syncytium component cells. Syncytial size increased gradually with nematode development in S cultivars. Moreover, an incompatibility reaction occurred in M wheat roots: the syncytium was disorganized, exhibiting disintegration and condensed nuclei. These sources of genetic resistance against CCN can potentially be planted in severely infested fields to reduce economic loss or can be used for introgression in breeding."

Out of 35 Yr genes, 25 genes amplified the loci associated with Yr genes. Of the 35, 18 were all-stage resistance ASR (All-stage resistance) genes and 7 (Yr16, Yr18, Yr29, Yr30, Yr36, Yr46 &Yr59) were APR (Adult-plant resistance) genes.

Fifty-three wheat genotypes were found resistant to yellow rust (ITs 0), accounting for 77.94% of total entries. Coefficients of infection ranged from 0 to 60 among all wheat genotypes. Two genotypes (VL 1099 & VL 3002) were identified with maximum 15 Yr genes followed by 14 genes in VL 3010 and HI8759, respectively. Maximum number of all-stage resistance genes were identified in RKD 292 (11) followed by ten genes in DBW 216, WH 1184 and VL 3002. Maximum number of adult-plant resistance gene was identified in VL 3009 (6), HI 8759 (5) and Lassik (4) respectively. Genes Yr26 (69.2%), Yr2 (69.1%), Yr64 (61.7%), Yr24 (58.9%), Yr7 (52.9%), Yr10 (50%) and Yr 48 (48.5%) showed high frequency among selected wheat genotypes, while Yr9 (2.94%), Yr36 (2.94%), Yr60 (1.47%) and Yr32 (8.8%) were least frequent in wheat genotypes. In future breeding programs, race specific genes and non-race specific genes should be utilised to pyramid with other effective genes to develop improved wheat cultivars with high-level and durable resistance to stripe rust. Proper deployment of Yr genes and utilizing the positive interactions will be helpful for resistance breeding in wheat."
"32849707","articletitle","Recent Progress in Germplasm Evaluation and Gene Mapping to Enable Breeding of Drought-Tolerant Wheat."
"32849707","abstracttext","There is a need to increase wheat productivity to meet the food demands of the ever-growing human population. However, accelerated development of high yielding varieties is hindered by drought, which is worsening due to climate change. In this context, germplasm diversity is central to the development of drought-tolerant wheat. Extensive collections of these genetic resources are conserved in national and international genebanks. In addition to phenotypic assessments, the use of advanced molecular techniques (e.g., genotype by sequencing) to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for drought tolerance related traits is useful for genome- and marker-assisted selection based approaches. Therefore, to assist wheat breeders at a critical time, we searched the recent peer-reviewed literature (2011-current), first, to identify wheat germplasm observed to be useful genetic sources for drought tolerance, and second, to report QTLs associated with drought tolerance. Though many breeders limit the parents used in breeding programs to a familiar core collection, the results of this review show that larger germplasm collections have been sources of useful genes for drought tolerance in wheat. The review also demonstrates that QTLs for drought tolerance in wheat are associated with diverse physio-morphological traits, at different growth stages. Here, we also briefly discuss the potential of genome engineering/editing to improve drought tolerance in wheat. The use of CRISPR-Cas9 and other gene-editing technologies can be used to fine-tune the expression of genes controlling drought adaptive traits, while high throughput phenotyping (HTP) techniques can potentially accelerate the selection process. These efforts are empowered by wheat researcher consortia."

"32836199","abstracttext","As one of the largest protein families in plants, F-box proteins are involved in many important cellular processes. Until now, a limited number of investigations have been conducted on wheat F-box genes due to its variable structure and large and polyploid genome. Classification, identification, structural analysis, evolutionary relationship, and chromosomal distribution of some wheat F-box genes are described in the present study. A total number of 1013 potential F-box proteins which are encoded by 409 genes was identified in wheat, and classified into 12 subfamilies based on their C-terminal domain structures. Furthermore, proteins with identical or similar C-terminal domain were clustered together. Location of 409Â F-box genes was identified on all 21 wheat chromosomes but showed an uneven distribution. Segmental duplication was the main reason for the increase in the number of wheat F-box genes. Gene expression analysis based on digital PCR showed that most of the F-box genes were highly expressed in the later development stages of wheat, including the formation of spike, grain, flag leaf, and participated in drought stress (DS), heat stress (HS), and their combination (HD). Of the nine F-box genes we investigated using quantitative PCR (qPCR) following fungal pathogen infection, five were involved in wheat resistance to the infection by leaf rust pathogen and one in the susceptible response. These results provide important information on wheat F-box proteins for further functional studies, especially the proteins that played roles in response to heat and drought stresses and leaf rust pathogen infection."

"33030571","abstracttext_key message","GWAS identified stable loci for TGW and stress tolerance in winter wheat based on two sowing conditions, which will provide opportunities for developing new cultivars with high yield and yield stability. Wheat is an important food crop widely cultivated in the world. Breeding new varieties with high yields and superior adaptability is the main goal of modern wheat breeding program. In order to determine the marker-trait associations (MATs), a set of 688 diverse winter wheat accessions were subjected to genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the wheat 90K array. Field trials under normal-sown (NS) and late-sown (LS) conditions were conducted for thousandÂ grain weight (TGW) and stress susceptibility index (SSI) at three different sites across two consecutive years. A total of 179 (NS) and 158 (LS) MATs corresponded with TGW; of these, 16 and 6 stable MATs for TGW NS and TGW LS were identified on chromosomes 1B, 2B, 3A, 3B, 5A, 5B, 5D, 6B, and 7D across at least three environments. Notably, a QTL hot spot controlling TGW under NS and LS conditions was found on chromosome 5A (140-142Â cM). Moreover, 8 of 228 stable MATs on chromosomes 4B, 5A, and 5D for SSI were detected. A haplotype block associated with TGW and SSI was located on chromosome 5A at 91Â cM, nearby the vernalization gene VRN-A1. Additionally, analysis of wheat varieties from the different eras revealed that the grain weight and stress tolerance are not improved concurrently. Overall, our results provide promising alleles controlling grain weight and stress tolerance (particularly for thermotolerance) for wheat breeders, which can be used in marker-assisted selection for improving grain yield and yield stability in wheat."

"33299089","abstracttext","Wheat dwarf bunt is caused by Tilletia controversa KÃ¼hn, which is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat worldwide. To explore the interaction of T. controversa and wheat, we analysed the transcriptome profile of spikes of the susceptible wheat cultivar Dongxuan 3, which was subjected to a T. controversa infection and a mock infection. The results obtained from a differential expression analysis of T. controversa-infected plants compared with mock-infected ones showed that 10,867 out of 21,354 genes were upregulated, while 10,487 genes were downregulated, and these genes were enriched in 205 different pathways. Our findings demonstrated that the genes associated with defence against diseases, such as PR-related genes, WRKY transcription factors and mitogen-activated protein kinase genes, were more highly expressed in response to T. controversa infection. Additionally, a number of genes related to physiological attributes were expressed during infection. Three pathways were differentiated based on the characteristics of gene ontology classification. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that twenty genes were expressed differentially during the infection of wheat with T. controversa. Notable changes were observed in the transcriptomes of wheat plants after infection. The results of this study may help to elucidate the mechanism governing the interactions between this pathogen and wheat plants and may facilitate the development of new methods to increase the resistance level of wheat against T. controversa, including the overexpression of defence-related genes."

"2813063","abstracttext","The human theta-globin gene in man appears to be functional, based on its sequence and evolutionary conservation. However its physiological role is unknown and furthermore its deletion in some individuals appears to have no effect on erythroid development. We have therefore analysed the transcriptional and translational competence of the theta globin gene to assess whether or not it is a silent or active globin gene. First, we demonstrate that theta globin mRNA is correctly spliced, by sequencing its cDNA. Second, using this theta cDNA, we generated synthetic theta globin mRNA and were able to demonstrate that this mRNA is translated into theta globin protein in wheat germ in vitro translation extracts. Similarly, the theta globin gene transfected into an erythroid cell line produces a protein product that comigrates with theta globin. Finally, we analysed the unusual promoter of the theta globin gene. The GC rich sequence directly adjacent to the multiple cap sites of theta globin mRNA functions as a promoter element in both erythroid and non-erythroid cell lines, while the more usual CCAAT and ATA box regions (found in all other globin genes) which are displaced by the GC rich promoter sequence, do not possess detectible promoter activity. Taken together, these results suggest that theta globin may have some as yet undetermined role in human erythropoiesis."

"2131098","abstracttext","Bacteria belonging to the Azospirillum genus are nitrogen fixers that colonize the roots of grasses, but do not cause the formation of differentiated structures. Sequences from total DNA of several Azospirillum strains are homologous to restriction fragments containing Rhizobium meliloti nodulation genes. A 10-kilobase (kb) EcoRI fragment from A. brasilense Sp7, sharing homology with a 6.8-kb EcoRI fragment carrying nodGEFH and part of nodP of R. meliloti 41, was cloned in pUC18 to yield pAB502. The nucleotide sequence of a 3.5-kb EcoRI-SmaI fragment of the pAB502 insert revealed 60% homology with R. meliloti nodP and nodQ genes. The nodP gene product shares no homology to any known protein sequence. The Azospirillum nodQ gene product shares homology with a family of initiation and elongation factors as does the R. meliloti nodQ gene product. Since the nodQ gene overlaps the nodP gene, the two genes might be cotranscribed. Azospirillum contains large plasmids, and the nodPQ genes were found on the 90-MDa plasmid (p90). A translational nodP-lacZ fusion was constructed in the broad host range plasmid pGD926. No beta-galactosidase activity was detected in Escherichia coli, but the fusion was functional in Azospirillum and constitutively expressed. Deletions and mutations of nodPQ did not modify growth, nitrogen fixation, or interaction with wheat seedlings."
"7476849","articletitle","A maize DNA-binding factor with a bZIP motif is induced by low temperature."
"7476849","abstracttext","We have isolated a low temperature-induced maize gene, mlip15, via cross hybridization using rice lip19. The longest cDNA isolated comprised 1179 bp and coded for a 135 amino acid bZIP (basic region/leucine zipper) protein. The gene showed 61.4% and 68.9% identity with the rice gene at the DNA and amino acid sequence levels, respectively, and is distinct from other maize genes that code for bZIP proteins. The level of mlip15 transcript was positively regulated by low temperature in the same way as the lip19 transcript. The levels of the transcript were also strongly increased by salt stress and exogenous abscisic acid, and slightly increased by anaerobiosis, but were not affected by heat shock and drought. The mLIP15 protein and truncated derivatives, produced in rabbit reticulocyte lysates or in an Escherichia coli expression system, were able to bind to a fragment of the wheat histone H3 gene promoter. This binding was diminished by addition of a molar excess of the hexamer sequence 5'-ACGTCA-3' found in the promoter and of the G-box-like sequence, but not by the addition of the ocs sequence or a mutated hexamer sequence. The factor bound to a promoter region of the maize Adh1 gene, expression of which is also induced by low temperature. These results lead to the conclusion that mlip15 is a strong candidate for a low temperature-induced transcription factor in maize."
"7476857","articletitle","Developmental and tissue-specific regulation of the gene for the wheat basic/leucine zipper protein HBP-1a(17) in transgenic Arabidopsis plants."
"7476857","abstracttext","Wheat basic/leucine zipper protein HBP-1a(17) binds in vitro specifically to ACGT motif-containing cis-acting elements, such as the type I element of plant histone promoters and the G-box of hormone- and light-inducible promoters. To address the in vivo function of HBP-1a(17), we isolated and structurally analyzed the HBP-1a(17) gene and examined its expression in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. The HBP-1a(17) gene is composed of 14 exons; the basic region and leucine zipper are encoded by separate small exons, as is the case for other bZIP protein genes. The G-box of the HBP-1a(17) promoter bound specifically to HBP-1a(17) and its related HBP-1a isoforms, suggesting that the HBP-1a(17) gene may be autoregulated, although the binding affinity of these proteins in vitro is very low. In Arabidopsis plants, activation of the HBP-1a(17) promoter was highly restricted to photosynthetically active mesophyll, and guard cells and vascular bundles of vegetative leaves. Etiolation of transgenic plants resulted in inhibition of expression of the HBP-1a(17) promoter. Indeed, the HBP-1a(17) promoter contains several sequence elements homologous to cis-acting elements conserved in light-inducible promoters. It is, therefore, assumed that the HBP-1a(17) gene is light regulated and that HBP-1a(17) is involved in light-responsive gene transcription via the G-box."
"9065693","articletitle","Structure, hormonal regulation, and chromosomal location of genes encoding barley (1-->4)-beta-xylan endohydrolases."
"9065693","abstracttext","A gene encoding (1-->4)-beta-xylan xylanohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.8) isoenzyme X-I has been isolated from a barley genomic library and the nucleotide sequence of a 2704-bp fragment defined. The gene contains a single intron of 91 bp in the coding region of the mature enzyme and additional introns may be present in the 5'-untranslated region. Expression of the xylanase gene is restricted to the aleurone layer of germinated grain, where the phytohormone gibberellic acid induces both transcriptional activity of the gene and the secretion of active enzyme from the layers. Abscisic acid abolishes the gibberellic acid induction of xylanase gene expression. The hormonal responses are consistent with the presence of promoter sequences, all of which are within 150 bp of the putative transcription start site, that have been implicated as cis-acting elements within gibberellic acid response complexes in plant genes. The elements include a pyrimidine box, CTCTTTCC, together with TAACGAC and TATCCAT boxes. Three genes encode (1-->4)-beta-xylanase isoenzymes in barley and these have been mapped on the barley genome using two doubled haploid populations and seven wheat-barley addition lines. The three xylanase genes are closely linked on the long arm of chromosome 7 (5H). No recombination was detected between the genes in 234 doubled haploid lines. The genes are flanked by the RFLP markers CDO506 on the proximal side and PSR370 at the distal end."
"9443806","articletitle","Overexpression in Escherichia coli of chemically synthesized gene for active 0.19 alpha-amylase inhibitor from wheat kernel."
"9443806","abstracttext","A synthetic gene encoding 0.19 alpha-amylase inhibitor (alpha-AI) from wheat kernel was obtained by enzymatic assembly of 18 oligodeoxynucleotides which were chemically synthesized. The synthetic gene was introduced into vector pET15b for expression in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) under the control of T7 promoter. However, in SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analyses of the E. coli cell lysate, the expression product could not be detected. Expression analysis for various partially deleted gene fragments suggested that the putative hairpin-like structure of mRNA in the 5'-terminal coding region might interrupt efficient expression. When the hairpin structure was eliminated by using degenerate codons, the resulting gene could be overexpressed in E. coli. Although the gene product was accumulated in an insoluble fraction as inclusion bodies, its inhibitory activity could be recovered by solubilization with 8 M urea, followed by refolding through two successive steps of dialysis at alkaline pH. After purification, the recombinant 0.19 alpha-AI showed the same characteristics as the authentic inhibitor in terms of N-terminal amino acid sequence, peptide mapping on reverse-phase HPLC, far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectrum and have inhibition of human salivary alpha-amylase. Thus, we have established an overexpression system in E. coli for active recombinant 0.19 alpha-AI."
"11600500","articletitle","Melittin enables efficient vesicular escape and enhanced nuclear access of nonviral gene delivery vectors."
"11600500","abstracttext","Entry of exogenously applied DNA into the cytoplasm and subsequent transport into the nucleus are major cellular barriers for nonviral gene delivery vectors. To overcome these barriers, we have covalently attached the cationic peptide melittin to poly(ethylenimine) (PEI). This conjugate condensed DNA into small, discrete particles (<100 nm in diameter), and the membrane lytic activity of melittin enabled efficient release of the DNA into the cytoplasm, as monitored by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Compared with PEI, the transfection activity was strongly increased within a broad range of cell lines and types tested, including different tumor cell lines but also primary hepatocytes and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The early onset of gene expression (within 4 h, reaching maximal values after 12 h) and the high reporter gene expression achieved in slowly dividing or confluent cells suggested a further role of melittin after releasing the DNA into the cytoplasm. Intracytoplasmic microinjection of melittin-containing PEI.DNA complexes into fibroblasts produced 40% cellular frequency of reporter gene expression that was inhibitable by co-injection of wheat germ agglutinin, whereas simple PEI.DNA complexes showed only 10%. These data suggest that melittin enables release of nonviral gene transfer particles into the cytoplasm and also enhances their transport into the nucleus, possibly via the cationic cluster KRKR near the C terminus of the peptide."
"12739882","articletitle","Functional analysis of two matrix attachment region (MAR) elements in transgenic maize plants."
"12739882","abstracttext","Matrix attachment regions (MARs) are binding sites for nuclear scaffold proteins in vitro, and are proposed to mediate the attachment of chromatin to the nuclear scaffold in vivo. Previous reports suggest that MAR elements may stabilize transgene expression. Here, we tested the effects of two maize MAR elements (P-MAR from the P1-rr gene, and Adh1-MAR from the adh1 gene) on the expression of a gusA reporter gene driven by three different promoters: the maize p1 gene promoter, a wheat peroxidase (WP) gene promoter, or a synthetic promoter (Rsyn7). The inclusion of P-MAR or Adh1-MAR on P::GUS transgene constructs did not reduce variation in the levels of GUS activity among independent transformation events, nor among the progeny derived from each event. The Adh1-MAR element did not affect GUS expression driven by the WP promoter, but did modify the spatial pattern of expression of the Rsyn7::GUS transgene. These results indicate that, in transgenic maize plants, the effects of MAR elements can vary significantly depending upon the promoter used to drive the transgene."

"15809006","abstracttext","The red pigmentation of Fusarium graminearum and related species that cause stem and head blight of cereals is due to the deposition of aurofusarin in the cell walls. To determine the importance of this polyketide for fungal physiology and pathogenicity, aurofusarin deficient mutants were produced by random and targeted mutagenesis of F. pseudograminearum and F. graminearum. We show that a gene cluster, including the F. graminearum PKS12 gene, is responsible for the biosynthesis of aurofusarin. Three F. pseudograminearum aurofusarin deficient mutants were disrupted in a region upstream from a gene with sequence homology to the aflatoxin regulatory gene aflR. Comparative PCR analyses of the aurofusarin gene cluster in F. graminearum, F. culmorum, and F. pseudograminearum show conserved organization and expression analyses detected no PKS12 transcripts in any of the mutants. To confirm that PKS12 encodes the precursor for aurofusarin, targeted mutagenesis was carried out in F. graminearum. All disruptants showed an albino phenotype. The DeltaPKS12 mutants have higher growth rate and a 10-fold increase in conidia production compared to the wild type. Aurofusarin does not appear to aid in radiation protection and all the mutants are fully pathogenic on wheat and barley. HPLC analyses of aurofusarin deficient mutants confirm the absence of aurofusarin and show an increase in the level of the mycotoxin zearalenone."

"18943005","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Fusarium graminearum is an important pathogen of small grains and maize in many areas of the world. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of F. graminearum pathogenesis, we used the restriction enzyme-mediated integration (REMI) approach to generate random insertional mutants. Eleven pathogenicity mutants were identified by screening 6,500 hygromycin-resistant transformants. Genetic analyses indicated that the defects in plant infection were tagged by the transforming vector in six of these mutants. In mutant M8, the transforming plasmid was integrated 110-bp upstream from the start codon of the cystathionine betalyase gene (CBL1). Gene replacement mutants deleted for CBL1 and the methionine synthase gene MSY1 were also obtained. Both the cbl1 and msy1 deletion mutants were methionine auxotrophic and significantly reduced in virulence on corn silks and wheat heads. We also identified genes disrupted by the transforming DNA in three other REMI mutants exhibiting reduced virulence. In mutants M68, the transforming vectors were inserted in the NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase. The putative b-ZIP transcription factor gene and the transducin beta-subunit-like gene disrupted in mutants M7 and M75, respectively, had no known homologs in filamentous fungi and were likely to be novel fungal virulence factors."
"17186618","articletitle","A novel wheat alpha-amylase gene (alpha-Amy3)."
"17186618","abstracttext","A genomic clone of a wheat alpha-amylase gene (lambdaAmy3/33) was identified, on the basis of hybridisation properties, as different from alpha-Amy1 and alpha-Amy2 genes which had been characterised previously. The nucleotide sequence revealed that this gene has the normal sequence motifs of an active gene and an open reading frame interrupted by two introns. The protein sequence encoded by this open reading frame is recognisably similar to that of alpha-amylase from the alpha-Amy1 and alpha-Amy2 genes and there is high sequence homology in all three proteins at the putative active sites and Ca++ binding region. In addition, the introns are at positions equivalent to the position of introns in the alpha-Amy1 and alpha-Amy2 genes. However, the sequence was less similar to alpha-Amy1 and alpha-Amy2 than these are to each other. Southern blot analysis showed that the lambdaAmy3/33 DNA is one of a small multigene family carried on a different chromosome (group 5) from either the alpha-Amy1 or alpha-Amy2 genes. A further difference from the alpha-Amy1 and alpha-Amy2 genese was the pattern of expression. lambdaAmy3/33 was expreseed only in immature grains and, unlike the alpha-Amy1 and alpha-Amy2 genes, not at all in germinating aleurones. These data suggested therefore that this gene represents a third type of alpha-amylase gene, not described before, which shares a common evolutionary ancestor with the alpha-Amy1 and alpha-Amy2 genes."
