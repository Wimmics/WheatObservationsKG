"27593460","abstracttext","Wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides) is considered a promising source for improving drought resistance in domesticated wheat. Nevertheless, wild germplasm has not been widely used in wheat breeding for abiotic stress resilience. In the current study, a near isogenic line NIL-7A-B-2, introgressed with a drought-related QTL from wild emmer wheat on chromosome 7A, and its recurrent parent, bread wheat cv. BarNir, were investigated under four environments across 2 years-water-limited and well-watered conditions in a rain-protected screen-house (Year 1) and two commercial open field plots under ample precipitation (Year 2). NIL-7A-B-2 exhibited an advantage over BarNir in grain yield and biomass production under most environments. Further physiological analyses suggested that enhanced photosynthetic capacity and photochemistry combined with higher flag leaf area are among the factors underlying the improved productivity of NIL-7A-B-2. These were coupled with improved sink capacity in NIL-7A-B-2, manifested by greater yield components than its parental line. This study provides further support for our previous findings that introgression of wild emmer QTL alleles, using marker assisted selection, can enhance grain yield and biomass production across environments in domesticated wheat, thereby enriching the modern gene pool with essential diversity for the improvement of yield and drought resistance."
"30141064","articletitle","Reassessment of the evolution of wheat chromosomes 4A, 5A, and 7B."
"30141064","abstracttext_key message","Comparison of genome sequences of wild emmer wheat and Aegilops tauschii suggests a novel scenario of the evolution of rearranged wheat chromosomes 4A, 5A, and 7B. Past research suggested that wheat chromosome 4A was subjected to a reciprocal translocation T(4AL;5AL)1 that occurred in the diploid progenitor of the wheat A subgenome and to three major rearrangements that occurred in polyploid wheat: pericentric inversion Inv(4AS;4AL)1, paracentric inversion Inv(4AL;4AL)1, and reciprocal translocation T(4AL;7BS)1. Gene collinearity along the pseudomolecules of tetraploid wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides, subgenomes AABB) and diploid Aegilops tauschii (genomes DD) was employed to confirm these rearrangements and to analyze the breakpoints. The exchange of distal regions of chromosome arms 4AS and 4AL due to pericentric inversion Inv(4AS;4AL)1 was detected, and breakpoints were validated with an optical Bionano genome map. Both breakpoints contained satellite DNA. The breakpoints of reciprocal translocation T(4AL;7BS)1 were also found. However, the breakpoints that generated paracentric inversion Inv(4AL;4AL)1 appeared to be collocated with the 4AL breakpoints that had produced Inv(4AS;4AL)1 and T(4AL;7BS)1. Inv(4AS;4AL)1, Inv(4AL;4AL)1, and T(4AL;7BS)1 either originated sequentially, and Inv(4AL;4AL)1 was produced by recurrent chromosome breaks at the same breakpoints that generated Inv(4AS;4AL)1 and T(4AL;7BS)1, or Inv(4AS;4AL)1, Inv(4AL;4AL)1, and T(4AL;7BS)1 originated simultaneously. We prefer the latter hypothesis since it makes fewer assumptions about the sequence of events that produced these chromosome rearrangements."

"31218178","abstracttext","Identification and cloning of new glutenin genes from wheat-related species can provide candidate gene resources for quality improvement of wheat. In this study, ten special high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS), including five x-type (1S l 2x, 1S l 16x, 1S l 17x, 1S l 23x, and 1S l 25x) and five y-type (1S l 2y, 1S l 6y 1 , 1S l 16y, 1S l 17y, and 1S l 23y) from Aegilops longissima L. (S l S l , 2n = 2x = 14) were identified, and their complete encoding genes were cloned by allelic-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR). The deduced amino acid (aa) residues of the x-type subunit genes ranged from 821 aa (2469 bp) to 941 aa (2829 bp), while those of the y-type subunit genes varied from 749 aa (2250 bp) to 771 aa (2361 bp). These special HMW-GS had a longer central repetitive domain with more glutamine repeats and glutamine residues compared to the previously characterized HMW-GS in common wheat, which provided a structural basis for superior gluten quality formation. The authenticity of the four cloned genes were verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS). Abundant single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and insertion/deletion (InDel) variations among these genes were identified, which would benefit for developing specific molecular markers used for wheat gluten quality improvement. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 1S l -encoded HMW-GS had close relationships with those from bread wheat, which were divergent from Triticum species at 2.10-10.00 million years ago. Our results indicate that the 1S l genome contains superior candidate glutenin genes that have potential application values for the improvement of wheat bread making quality."

"23688397","abstracttext_background","The PLAnt co-EXpression database (PLANEX) is a new internet-based database for plant gene analysis. PLANEX (http://planex.plantbioinformatics.org) contains publicly available GeneChip data obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). PLANEX is a genome-wide co-expression database, which allows for the functional identification of genes from a wide variety of experimental designs. It can be used for the characterization of genes for functional identification and analysis of a gene's dependency among other genes. Gene co-expression databases have been developed for other species, but gene co-expression information for plants is currently limited."
"23688397","abstracttext_description","We constructed PLANEX as a list of co-expressed genes and functional annotations for Arabidopsis thaliana, Glycine max, Hordeum vulgare, Oryza sativa, Solanum lycopersicum, Triticum aestivum, Vitis vinifera and Zea mays. PLANEX reports Pearson's correlation coefficients (PCCs; r-values) that distribute from a gene of interest for a given microarray platform set corresponding to a particular organism. To support PCCs, PLANEX performs an enrichment test of Gene Ontology terms and Cohen's Kappa value to compare functional similarity for all genes in the co-expression database. PLANEX draws a cluster network with co-expressed genes, which is estimated using the k-mean method. To construct PLANEX, a variety of datasets were interpreted by the IBM supercomputer Advanced Interactive eXecutive (AIX) in a supercomputing center."
"23688397","abstracttext_conclusion","PLANEX provides a correlation database, a cluster network and an interpretation of enrichment test results for eight plant species. A typical co-expressed gene generates lists of co-expression data that contain hundreds of genes of interest for enrichment analysis. Also, co-expressed genes can be identified and cataloged in terms of comparative genomics by using the 'Co-expression gene compare' feature. This type of analysis will help interpret experimental data and determine whether there is a common term among genes of interest."
"17629796","articletitle","Rapid evolution and complex structural organization in genomic regions harboring multiple prolamin genes in the polyploid wheat genome."
"17629796","abstracttext","Genes encoding wheat prolamins belong to complicated multi-gene families in the wheat genome. To understand the structural complexity of storage protein loci, we sequenced and analyzed orthologous regions containing both gliadin and LMW-glutenin genes from the A and B genomes of a tetraploid wheat species, Triticum turgidum ssp. durum. Despite their physical proximity to one another, the gliadin genes and LMW-glutenin genes are organized quite differently. The gliadin genes are found to be more clustered than the LMW-glutenin genes which are separated from each other by much larger distances. The separation of the LMW-glutenin genes is the result of both the insertion of large blocks of repetitive DNA owing to the rapid amplification of retrotransposons and the presence of genetic loci interspersed between them. Sequence comparisons of the orthologous regions reveal that gene movement could be one of the major factors contributing to the violation of microcolinearity between the homoeologous A and B genomes in wheat. The rapid sequence rearrangements and differential insertion of repetitive DNA has caused the gene islands to be not conserved in compared regions. In addition, we demonstrated that the i-type LMW-glutenin originated from a deletion of 33-bps in the 5' coding region of the m-type gene. Our results show that multiple rounds of segmental duplication of prolamin genes have driven the amplification of the omega-gliadin genes in the region; such segmental duplication could greatly increase the repetitive DNA content in the genome depending on the amount of repetitive DNA present in the original duplicate region."

"19851796","abstracttext","The earliness per se gene Eps-A ( m ) 1 from diploid wheat Triticum monococcum affects heading time, spike development, and spikelet number. In this study, the Eps1 orthologous regions from rice, Aegilops tauschii, and Brachypodium distachyon were compared as part of current efforts to clone this gene. A single Brachypodium BAC clone spanned the Eps-A ( m ) 1 region, but a gap was detected in the A. tauschii physical map. Sequencing of the Brachypodium and A. tauschii BAC clones revealed three genes shared by the three species, which showed higher identity between wheat and Brachypodium than between them and rice. However, most of the structural changes were detected in the wheat lineage. These included an inversion encompassing the wg241-VatpC region and the presence of six unique genes. In contrast, only one unique gene (and one pseudogene) was found in Brachypodium and none in rice. Three genes were present in both Brachypodium and wheat but were absent in rice. Two of these genes, Mot1 and FtsH4, were completely linked to the earliness per se phenotype in the T. monococcum high-density genetic map and are candidates for Eps-A ( m ) 1. Both genes were expressed in apices and developing spikes, as expected for Eps-A ( m ) 1 candidates. The predicted MOT1 protein showed amino acid differences between the parental T. monococcum lines, but its effect is difficult to predict. Future steps to clone the Eps-A ( m ) 1 gene include the generation of mot1 and ftsh4 mutants and the completion of the T. monococcum physical map to test for the presence of additional candidate genes."
"22170431","articletitle","Identification and comparative mapping of a powdery mildew resistance gene derived from wild emmer (Triticum turgidum var. dicoccoides) on chromosome 2BS."
"22170431","abstracttext","Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is an important foliar disease of wheat worldwide. Wild emmer (Triticum turgidum var. dicoccoides) is a valuable genetic resource for improving disease resistance in common wheat. A powdery mildew resistance gene conferring resistance to B. graminis f. sp. tritici isolate E09 at the seedling and adult stages was identified in wild emmer accession IW170 introduced from Israel. An incomplete dominant gene, temporarily designated MlIW170, was responsible for the resistance. Through molecular marker and bulked segregant analyses of an F(2) population and F(3) families derived from a cross between susceptible durum wheat line 81086A and IW170, MlIW170 was located in the distal chromosome bin 2BS3-0.84-1.00 and flanked by SSR markers Xcfd238 and Xwmc243. MlIW170 co-segregated with Xcau516, an STS marker developed from RFLP marker Xwg516 that co-segregated with powdery mildew resistance gene Pm26 on 2BS. Four EST-STS markers, BE498358, BF201235, BQ160080, and BF146221, were integrated into the genetic linkage map of MlIW170. Three AFLP markers, XPaacMcac, XPagcMcta, XPaacMcag, and seven AFLP-derived SCAR markers, XcauG2, XcauG3, XcauG6, XcauG8, XcauG10, XcauG20, and XcauG25, were linked to MlIW170. XcauG3, a resistance gene analog (RGA)-like sequence, co-segregated with MlIW170. The non-glaucousness locus Iw1 was 18.77 cM distal to MlIW170. By comparative genomics of wheat-Brachypodium-rice genomic co-linearity, four EST-STS markers, CJ658408, CJ945509, BQ169830, CJ945085, and one STS marker XP2430, were developed and MlIW170 was mapped in an 2.69 cM interval that is co-linear with a 131 kb genomic region in Brachypodium and a 105 kb genomic region in rice. Four RGA-like sequences annotated in the orthologous Brachypodium genomic region could serve as chromosome landing target regions for map-based cloning of MlIW170."
"28855282","articletitle","Discovery of a Novel Stem Rust Resistance Allele in Durum Wheat that Exhibits Differential Reactions to Ug99 Isolates."
"28855282","abstracttext","Wheat stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici Eriks. & E. Henn, can incur yield losses in susceptible cultivars of durum wheat, Triticum turgidum ssp. durum (Desf.) Husnot. Although several durum cultivars possess the stem rust resistance gene Sr13 , additional genes in durum wheat effective against emerging virulent races have not been described. Durum line 8155-B1 confers resistance against the P. graminis f. sp. tritici race TTKST, the variant race of the Ug99 race group with additional virulence to wheat stem rust resistance gene Sr24 However, 8155-B1 does not confer resistance to the first-described race in the Ug99 race group: TTKSK. We mapped a single gene conferring resistance in 8155-B1 against race TTKST, Sr8155B1 , to chromosome arm 6AS by utilizing Rusty/8155-B1 and Rusty*2/8155-B1 populations and the 90K Infinium iSelect Custom bead chip supplemented by KASP assays. One marker, KASP_6AS_IWB10558 , cosegregated with Sr8155B1 in both populations and correctly predicted Sr8155B1 presence or absence in 11 durum cultivars tested. We confirmed the presence of Sr8155B1 in cultivar Mountrail by mapping in the population Choteau/Mountrail. The marker developed in this study could be used to predict the presence of resistance to race TTKST in uncharacterized durum breeding lines, and also to combine Sr8155B1 with resistance genes effective to Ug99 such as Sr13 The map location of Sr8155B1 cannot rule out the possibility that this gene is an allele at the Sr8 locus. However, race specificity indicates that Sr8155B1 is different from the known alleles Sr8a and Sr8b ."

"31795948","abstracttext_background","Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance in the durum wheat breeding gene pool is rarely reported. Triticum turgidum ssp. carthlicum line Blackbird is a tetraploid relative of durum wheat that offers partial FHB resistance. Resistance QTL were identified for the durum wheat cv. Strongfield × Blackbird population on chromosomes 1A, 2A, 2B, 3A, 6A, 6B and 7B in a previous study. The objective of this study was to identify the defense mechanisms underlying the resistance of Blackbird and report candidate regulator defense genes and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers within these genes for high-resolution mapping of resistance QTL reported for the durum wheat cv. Strongfield/Blackbird population."
"31795948","abstracttext_results","Gene network analysis identified five networks significantly (P < 0.05) associated with the resistance to FHB spread (Type II FHB resistance) one of which showed significant correlation with both plant height and relative maturity traits. Two gene networks showed subtle differences between Fusarium graminearum-inoculated and mock-inoculated plants, supporting their involvement in constitutive defense. The candidate regulator genes have been implicated in various layers of plant defense including pathogen recognition (mainly Nucleotide-binding Leucine-rich Repeat proteins), signaling pathways including the abscisic acid and mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase, and downstream defense genes activation including transcription factors (mostly with dual roles in defense and development), and cell death regulator and cell wall reinforcement genes. The expression of five candidate genes measured by quantitative real-time PCR was correlated with that of RNA-seq, corroborating the technical and analytical accuracy of RNA-sequencing."
"31795948","abstracttext_conclusions","Gene network analysis allowed identification of candidate regulator genes and genes associated with constitutive resistance, those that will not be detected using traditional differential expression analysis. This study also shed light on the association of developmental traits with FHB resistance and partially explained the co-localization of FHB resistance with plant height and maturity QTL reported in several previous studies. It also allowed the identification of candidate hub genes within the interval of three previously reported FHB resistance QTL for the Strongfield/Blackbird population and associated SNPs for future high resolution mapping studies."
"31895011","articletitle","At Least Five Major Genes Are Involved in the Avirulence of an Eleusine Isolate of Pyricularia oryzae on Common Wheat."
"31895011","abstracttext","Pyricularia oryzae is composed of pathotypes that show host specificity at the plant genus level. To elucidate the genetic mechanisms of the incompatibility between the Eleusine pathotype (pathogenic on finger millet) and common wheat, an Eleusine isolate (MZ5-1-6) was crossed with a Triticum isolate (Br48) pathogenic on wheat, and resulting F 1 cultures were sprayed onto common wheat cultivars Hope, Norin 4 (N4), and Chinese Spring (CS). On Hope, avirulent and virulent cultures segregated in a 3:1 ratio, suggesting that two avirulence genes are involved. They were tentatively designated as eA1 and eA2 . On N4 and CS, the segregation ratio was not significantly deviated from the 7:1, 15:1, or 31:1 ratios, suggesting that three or more genes are involved. A comparative analysis of the segregation patterns suggested that two of these genes were eA1 and eA2 . A complementation test indicated that the third gene (tentatively designated as eA3 ) was the Ao9 type of the PWT3 gene controlling the avirulence of Avena and Lolium isolates on wheat. The fourth gene (tentatively designated as eA4 ) was detected by backcrossing 200R72, an F 1 culture lacking eA1, eA2 , and eA3 , with Br48. Comparative analyses of phenotypes and the presence and/or absence of molecular markers in the F 1 population revealed that some cultures were avirulent on N4/CS in spite of lacking eA1, eA2, eA3 , and eA4 , indicating the presence of the fifth gene (tentatively designated as eA5 ). Taken together, we conclude that at least five avirulence genes are involved in the incompatibility between MZ5-1-6 and N4/CS."
"24221371","articletitle","pEmu: an improved promoter for gene expression in cereal cells."
"24221371","abstracttext","A recombinant promoter, pEmu, has been constructed to give a high level of gene expression in monocots. It is based on a truncated maize Adh1 promoter, with multiple copies of the Anaerobic Responsive Element from the maize Adh1 gene and ocs-elements from the octopine synthase gene of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The pEmu promoter was one of 12 different promoter constructs that were linked to the β-glucuronidase (GUS) marker gene. Promoter activity was measured 48 h after introduction of the constructs into protoplasts of five different monocot species [wheat, maize, rice, einkorn (Triticum monococcum), and Lolium multiflorum] and one dicot (Nicotiana plumbaginifolia). In suspension cell protoplasts, the most highly expressing construct (pEmuGN) gave 10- to 50-fold higher expression than the CaMV 35S promoter in all the monocot species. The pEmu promoter should be valuable where a high level of gene expression is required in monocots. The pEmu promoter showed instability in several widely used Escherichia coli strains but was stable in a recA, recD strain AC001, which is described. Another construct, p4OCSΔ35SIGN, gave a tenfold increase in expression over the CaMV 35S promoter in dicot (Nicotiana plumbaginifolia) protoplasts."

"24272400","abstracttext","The development of an efficient transformation system is a prerequisite for the molecular analysis of gene expression in plants. In crop plants, this development has been hindered by difficulties encountered both in whole plant regeneration from protoplasts and in the general insusceptibility of monocots to Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. We have circumvented these difficulties by transferring foreign genes directly into the intact cells (with cell walls) of three important crop plants including rice, wheat and soybean by a particle bombardment device. Oryza sativa and Triticum monococcum cells were bombarded with accelerated tungsten particles coated with plasmids containing a β-glucuronidase gene as the reporter. Blue transformed cells were detected in an in situ enzyme assay. The number of blue cells was next used as a convenient criterion to study several factors affecting gene transfer efficiency. After optimal conditions were defined, gene transfer into intact cells of O. sativa, T. monococcum and Glycine max was successfully carried out with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene as the reporter."
"1752425","articletitle","Molecular analysis of the hot spot region related to length mutations in wheat chloroplast DNAs. I. Nucleotide divergence of genes and intergenic spacer regions located in the hot spot region."
"1752425","abstracttext","The nucleotide divergence of chloroplast DNAs around the hot spot region related to length mutation in Triticum (wheat) and Aegilops was analyzed. DNA sequences (ca. 4.5 kbp) of three chloroplast genome types of wheat complex were compared with one another and with the corresponding region of other grasses. The sequences region contained rbcL and psaI, two open reading frames, and a pseudogene, rpl23' (pseudogene for ribosomal protein L23) disrupted by AT-rich intergic spacer regions. The evolution of these genes in the closely related wheat complex is characterized by nonbiased nucleotide substitutions in terms of being synonymous/nonsynonymous, having A-T pressure transitions over transversions, and frequent changes at the third codon position, in contrast with the gene evolution among more distant plant groups where biased nucleotide substitutions have frequently occurred. The sequences of these genes had diverged almost in proportion to taxonomic distance. The sequence of the pseudogene rpl23' changed approximately two times faster than that of the coding region. Sequence comparison between the pseudogene and its protein-coding counterpart revealed different degrees of nucleotide homology in wheat, rice and maize, suggesting that the transposition timing of the pseudogene differed and/or that different rates of gene conversion operated on the pseudogene in the cpDNA of the three plant groups in Gramineae. The intergenic spacer regions diverged approximately ten times faster than the genes. The divergence of wheat from barley, and that from rice are estimated based on the nucleotide similarity to be 1.5, 10 and 40 million years, respectively."
"22384375","articletitle","A Novel Retrotransposon Inserted in the Dominant Vrn-B1 Allele Confers Spring Growth Habit in Tetraploid Wheat (Triticum turgidum L.)."
"22384375","abstracttext","Vernalization genes determine winter/spring growth habit in temperate cereals and play important roles in plant development and environmental adaptation. In wheat (Triticum L. sp.), it was previously shown that allelic variation in the vernalization gene VRN1 was due to deletions or insertions either in the promoter or in the first intron. Here, we report a novel Vrn-B1 allele that has a retrotransposon in its promoter conferring spring growth habit. The VRN-B1 gene was mapped in a doubled haploid population that segregated for winter-spring growth habit but was derived from two spring tetraploid wheat genotypes, the durum wheat (T. turgidum subsp. durum) variety 'Lebsock' and T. turgidum subsp. carthlicum accession PI 94749. Genetic analysis revealed that Lebsock carried the dominant Vrn-A1 and recessive vrn-B1 alleles, whereas PI 94749 had the recessive vrn-A1 and dominant Vrn-B1 alleles. The Vrn-A1 allele in Lebsock was the same as the Vrn-A1c allele previously reported in hexaploid wheat. No differences existed between the vrn-B1 and Vrn-B1 alleles, except that a 5463-bp insertion was detected in the 5'-UTR region of the Vrn-B1 allele. This insertion was a novel retrotransposon (designated as retrotrans_VRN), which was flanked by a 5-bp target site duplication and contained primer binding site and polypurine tract motifs, a 325-bp long terminal repeat, and an open reading frame encoding 1231 amino acids. The insertion of retrotrans_VRN resulted in expression of Vrn-B1 without vernalization. Retrotrans_VRN is prevalent among T. turgidum subsp. carthlicum accessions, less prevalent among T. turgidum subsp. dicoccum accessions, and rarely found in other tetraploid wheat subspecies."
"24201500","articletitle","Genetic divergence of heat production within and between the wild progenitors of wheat and barley: evolutionary and agronomical implications."
"24201500","abstracttext","We compared and contrasted calorimetrically heat production in seedlings incubated at 5°C and 24°C using genotypes from cold and warm Israeli populations of the wild progenitors of barley (Hordeum spontaneum) and wheat (Triticum dicoccoides). The wild barley sample comprised 14 accessions, 7 from cold localities and 7 from warm localities. The wild emmer wheat sample consisted of 12 accessions, 6 from a cold locality, and 6 from a warm locality. Our results indicated that (1) heat production was significantly higher in the two wild cereals at 5 °C than at 24 °C; (2) interspecifically, wild barley generates significantly more heat than wild wheat at both 5 °C and 24 °C; (3) intraspecifically, wild barley from warm environments generates significantly more heat than wild barley from cold ones, at 24 °C. We hypothesize that both the inter- and intraspecific differences in heat production evolved adaptively by natural selection in accordance with the niche-width genetic variation hypothesis. These differences presumably enhance biochemical processes, hence growth, thereby leading to the shorter annual cycle of barley compared to that of wheat, and may explain the wider range of the wild and cultivated gene pools of barley, as compared with those of wheat. We propose that a shortening of the growth period through utilizing heat production gene(s) is feasible by classical methods of breeding and/or modern biotechnology."
"25223542","articletitle","Linkage disequilibrium and association analysis of stripe rust resistance in wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides) population in Israel."
"25223542","abstracttext_key message","Rapid LD decay in wild emmer population from Israel allows high-resolution association mapping. Known and putative new stripe rust resistance genes were found. Genome-wide association mapping (GWAM) is becoming an important tool for the discovery and mapping of loci underlying trait variation in crops, but in the wild relatives of crops the use of GWAM has been limited. Critical factors for the use of GWAM are the levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and genetic diversity in mapped populations, particularly in those of self-pollinating species. Here, we report LD estimation in a population of 128 accessions of self-pollinating wild emmer, Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides, the progenitor of cultivated wheat, collected in Israel. LD decayed fast along wild emmer chromosomes and reached the background level within 1 cM. We employed GWAM for the discovery and mapping of genes for resistance to three isolates of Puccinia striiformis, the causative agent of wheat stripe rust. The wild emmer population was genotyped with the wheat iSelect assay including 8643 gene-associated SNP markers (wheat 9K Infinium) of which 2,278 were polymorphic. The significance of association between stripe rust resistance and each of the polymorphic SNP was tested using mixed linear model implemented in EMMA software. The model produced satisfactory results and uncovered four significant associations on chromosome arms 1BS, 1BL and 3AL. The locus on 1BS was located in a region known to contain stripe rust resistance genes. These results show that GWAM is an effective strategy for gene discovery and mapping in wild emmer that will accelerate the utilization of this genetic resource in wheat breeding."
"30167758","articletitle","Pm62, an adult-plant powdery mildew resistance gene introgressed from Dasypyrum villosum chromosome arm 2VL into wheat."
"30167758","abstracttext_key message","Pm62, a novel adult-plant resistance (APR) gene against powdery mildew, was transferred from D. villosum into common wheat in the form of Robertsonian translocation T2BS.2VL#5. Powdery mildew, which is caused by the fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is a major disease of wheat resulting in substantial yield and quality losses in many wheat production regions of the world. Introgression of resistance from wild species into common wheat has application for controlling this disease. A Triticum durum-Dasypyrum villosum chromosome 2V#5 disomic addition line, N59B-1 (2n = 30), improved resistance to powdery mildew at the adult-plant stage, which was attributable to chromosome 2V#5. To transfer this resistance into bread wheat, a total of 298 BC 1 F 1 plants derived from the crossing between N59B-1 and Chinese Spring were screened by combined genomic in situ hybridization and fluorescent in situ hybridization, 2V-specific marker analysis, and reaction to powdery mildew to confirm that a dominant adult-plant resistance gene, designated as Pm62, was located on chromosome 2VL#5. Subsequently, the 2VL#5 (2D) disomic substitution line (NAU1825) and the homozygous T2BS.2VL#5 Robertsonian translocation line (NAU1823), with normal plant vigor and full fertility, were identified by molecular and cytogenetic analyses of the BC 1 F 2 generation. The effects of the T2BS.2VL#5 recombinant chromosome on agronomic traits were also evaluated in the F 2 segregation population. The results suggest that the translocated chromosome may have no distinct effect on plant height, 1000-kernel weight or flowering period, but a slight effect on spike length and seeds per spike. The translocation line NAU1823 has being utilized as a novel germplasm in breeding for powdery mildew resistance, and the effects of the T2BS.2VL#5 recombinant chromosome on yield-related and flour quality characters will be further assessed."

"10994715","abstracttext","The present study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the PhI gene transferred from Aegilops speltoides into bread wheat cultivar Chinese Spring (CS) in inducing homoeologous chromosome pairing in interspecific crosses using the Chinese Spring line, CS(PhI), carrying the gene. Chinese Spring, as well as CS(PhI), were crossed as female parents with three accessions of Ae. kotschyi (UUSS), one accession of Secale cereale (RR), two amphiploids of Triticum durum-Ae. caudata (AABBCC), and one amphiploid of Triticum durum-Ae. umbellulata (AABBUU). Meiotic metaphase I chromosome pairing was studied in all the interspecific crosses with CS as well as CS(PhI). There was significant increase in chiasma frequency in all the crosses with CS(PhI) over those with CS. The extent of induced homoeologous chromosome pairing by PhI in crosses of CS(PhI) with S. cereale was higher than with those of Ae. kotschyi, as indicated by higher chiasma frequency per pollen mother cell. Significant reduction in frequency of univalents and increase in bivalents (>14), multivalents, and chiasma frequency in crosses of amphiploids with CS(PhI) as compared to those of CS indicated induced homoeologous pairing between C and D, D and U, and C, D, and U genomes with AB genomes in the presence of PhI. The results of the present study unequivocally demonstrate the effectiveness of PhI gene transferred from Ae. speltoides in hexaploid wheat in inducing homoeologous chromosome pairing and suggest that the line CS(PhI) can be effectively used for precise transfer of useful alien genetic variations with least linkage drag."

"32801489","abstracttext","Salt stress is a major abiotic stress causing adverse effects on plant growth and development. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of NaCl stress on growth, stress indicator parameters (lipid peroxidation, chlorophyll content and proline content), yield, and the expression of heat shock proteins genes ( Hsp17.8 , Hsp26.3 , Hsp70 and Hsp101 ) of five Jordanian durum wheat ( Triticum durum ) landraces. Plants were irrigated with tap water as control or 200 mM NaCl. Significant differences among the 5 Triticum durum landraces in terms of growth parameters, stress indicator parameters, and expression of heat shock proteins genes were observed. Salt stressed landraces demonstrated decreased growth, increased levels of stress indicator parameters, and upregulation in Hsp17.8 , Hsp26.3 , Hsp70 and Hsp101 expression. Landraces T11 and M23 showed the highest growth, lowest levels of stress indicator parameters, and high expression of heat shock protein genes under NaCl stress. Whereas, J2 and A8 landraces showed the lowest growth, highest levels of stress indicator parameters and low expression of heat shock protein genes under NaCl stress. In conclusion, NaCl stress caused significant reduction in growth parameters, increased level of lipid peroxidation and proline content and upregulation in heat shock proteins gene expression levels. Growth, stress indicator parameters and gene expression results suggest that T11 and M23 landraces are the most NaCl stress tolerant landraces and could be used to enhance the gene pool in wheat breeding programs."
"20571115","articletitle","Regulation of freezing tolerance and flowering in temperate cereals: the VRN-1 connection."
"20571115","abstracttext","In winter wheat (Triticum spp.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) varieties, long exposures to nonfreezing cold temperatures accelerate flowering time (vernalization) and improve freezing tolerance (cold acclimation). However, when plants initiate their reproductive development, freezing tolerance decreases, suggesting a connection between the two processes. To better understand this connection, we used two diploid wheat (Triticum monococcum) mutants, maintained vegetative phase (mvp), that carry deletions encompassing VRN-1, the major vernalization gene in temperate cereals. Homozygous mvp/mvp plants never flower, whereas plants carrying at least one functional VRN-1 copy (Mvp/-) exhibit normal flowering and high transcript levels of VRN-1 under long days. The Mvp/- plants showed reduced freezing tolerance and reduced transcript levels of several cold-induced C-REPEAT BINDING FACTOR transcription factors and COLD REGULATED genes (COR) relative to the mvp/mvp plants. Diploid wheat accessions with mutations in the VRN-1 promoter, resulting in high transcript levels under both long and short days, showed a significant down-regulation of COR14b under long days but not under short days. Taken together, these studies suggest that VRN-1 is required for the initiation of the regulatory cascade that down-regulates the cold acclimation pathway but that additional genes regulated by long days are required for the down-regulation of the COR genes. In addition, our results show that allelic variation in VRN-1 is sufficient to determine differences in freezing tolerance, suggesting that quantitative trait loci for freezing tolerance previously mapped on this chromosome region are likely a pleiotropic effect of VRN-1 rather than the effect of a separate closely linked locus (FROST RESISTANCE-1), as proposed in early freezing tolerance studies."

"24169762","abstracttext","Specific amplification of the complete coding region of all six high-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenin genes present in hexaploid wheat was obtained by the polyerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers specific for the N-terminal region of the 1Dx gene and for the repetitive domain of the y-type HMW glutenin genes were also developed. Although the primers were constructed on the basis of the nucleotide sequences of HMW glutenin genes present in T. aestivum L. cv 'Cheyenne', they were very efficient in amplifying HMW glutenin genes of diploid and tetraploid wheat species. PCR analysis of HMW glutenin genes of T. urartu Tuman., T. longissimum (Schweinf. & Muschl.) Bowden and T. speltoides (Tausch) Gren. ex Richt, showed a high degree of length polymorphism, whereas a low degree of length variation was found in accessions of T. tauschii (Coss.) Schmal. Furthermore, using primers specific for the repetitive regions of HMW genes, we could demonstrate that the size variation observed was due to a different length of the central repetitive domain. The usefulness of the PCR-based approach to analyze the genetic polymorphism of HMW glutenin genes, to isolate new allelic variants, to estimate their molecular size and to verify the number of cysteine residues is discussed."

"24232197","abstracttext","Reciprocal sets of homozygous inbred backcross lines were developed by crossing two pure line varieties (Baart 46 and Ramona) of Triticum aestivum L., followed by two backcrosses to each of the two parent varieties, and six to eight generations of selfing. Data on each inbred backcross line was obtained from twelve plots (from replications in three years). Five genes were responsible for over 95% of the genetic variation for heading date. These genes had pleiotropic effects on plant height that were proportional to their effects on heading date. Two additional genes had detectable effects on plant height. The genes with a measurable effect on height accounted for 90% of the genetic variation in the Baart 46 genetic background. One gene affected seed weight. In the Ramona background, this gene accounted for 80% of the genetic variation in seed weight and 16% of the genetic variation in seed yield. Two genes, responsible for the earliest and latest heading date classes, had large pleiotropic effects on seed yield. They accounted for 60% of the genetic variation in yield. One gene, with no effect on heading date, caused a detectable reduction in yield of 23% in the Baart 46 inbred backcross lines. This gene had no apparent effect in the Ramona genetic background. Quantitative trait genes are sparsely distributed in the genome: fewer than one in four chromosome arms carries a gene with a detectable effect. Gene effects on quantitative traits are not small and similar. The distribution of 22 gene effects for heading date and height is slightly skewed to the right: as the magnitude of effect increases, the frequency of genes having the effect decreases."

"31077147","abstracttext_background","Our study is the first to provide RNA-Seq data analysis related to transcriptomic responses towards drought across different crops. The aim was to identify and map which genes play a key role in drought response on leaves across different crops. Forty-two RNA-seq samples were analyzed from 9 published studies in 7 plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Solanum lycopersicum, Zea mays, Vitis vinifera, Malus X domestica, Solanum tuberosum, Triticum aestivum)."
"31077147","abstracttext_results","Twenty-seven (16 up-regulated and 11 down-regulated) drought-regulated genes were commonly present in at least 7 of 9 studies, while 351 (147 up-regulated and 204 down-regulated) were commonly drought-regulated in 6 of 9 studies. Across all kind of leaves, the drought repressed gene-ontologies were related to the cell wall and membrane re-structuring such as wax biosynthesis, cell wall organization, fatty acid biosynthesis. On the other hand, drought-up-regulated biological processes were related to responses to osmotic stress, abscisic acid, water deprivation, abscisic-activated signalling pathway, salt stress, hydrogen peroxide treatment. A common metabolic feature linked to drought response in leaves is the repression of terpenoid pathways. There was an induction of AL1 (alfin-like), UGKYAH (trihelix), WRKY20, homeobox genes and members of the SET domain family in 6 of 9 studies. Several genes involved in detoxifying and antioxidant reactions, signalling pathways and cell protection were commonly modulated by drought across the 7 species. The chromosome (Chr) mapping of these key abiotic stress genes highlighted that Chr 4 in Arabidopsis thaliana, Chr 1 in Zea mays, Chr 2 and Chr 5 in Triticum aestivum contained a higher presence of drought-related genes compared to the other remaining chromosomes. In seedling studies, it is worth notice the up-regulation of ERF4 and ESE3 (ethylene), HVA22 (abscisic acid), TIR1 (auxin) and some transcription factors (MYB3, MYB94, MYB1, WRKY53 and WRKY20). In mature leaves, ERF1 and Alfin-like 1 were induced by drought while other transcription factors (YABBY5, ARR2, TRFL2) and genes involved phospholipid biosynthesis were repressed."

"27349470","abstracttext","In the present study, we have screened 71, 713, 525, 119 and 241 mature miRNA variants from Hordeum vulgare, Oryza sativa, Brachypodium distachyon, Triticum aestivum, and Sorghum bicolor, respectively, and classified them with respect to their conservation status and expression levels. These Poaceae non-redundant miRNA species (1,669) were distributed over a total of 625 MIR families, among which only 54 were conserved across two or more plant species, confirming the relatively recent evolutionary differentiation of miRNAs in grasses. On the other hand, we have used 257 H. vulgare, 286T. aestivum, 119 B. distachyon, 269 O. sativa, and 139 S. bicolor NBS domains, which were either mined directly from the annotated proteomes, or predicted from whole genome sequence assemblies. The hybridization potential between miRNAs and their putative NBS genes targets was analyzed, revealing that at least 454 NBS genes from all five Poaceae were potentially regulated by 265 distinct miRNA species, most of them expressed in leaves and predominantly co-expressed in additional tissues. Based on gene ontology, we could assign these probable miRNA target genes to 16 functional groups, among which three conferring resistance to bacteria (Rpm1, Xa1 and Rps2), and 13 groups of resistance to fungi (Rpp8,13, Rp3, Tsn1, Lr10, Rps1-k-1, Pm3, Rpg5, and MLA1,6,10,12,13). The results of the present analysis provide a large-scale platform for a better understanding of biological control strategies of disease resistance genes in Poaceae, and will serve as an important starting point for enhancing crop disease resistance improvement by means of transgenic lines with artificial miRNAs."

"18781763","abstracttext","The genetic modification in fruit and vegetables could lead to changes in metabolic pathways and, therefore, to the variation of the molecular pattern, with particular attention to antioxidant compounds not well-described in the literature. The aim of the present study was to compare the quality composition of transgenic wheat ( Triticum durum L.), corn ( Zea mays L.), and tomato ( Lycopersicum esculentum Mill.) to the nontransgenic control with a similar genetic background. In the first experiment, Ofanto wheat cultivar containing the tobacco rab1 gene and nontransgenic Ofanto were used. The second experiment compared two transgenic lines of corn containing Bacillus thuringiensis ""Cry toxin"" gene (PR33P67 and Pegaso Bt) to their nontransgenic forms. The third experiment was conducted on transgenic tomato ( Lycopersicum esculentum Mill.) containing the Agrobacterium rhizogenes rolD gene and its nontransgenic control (cv. Tondino). Conventional and genetically modified crops were compared in terms of fatty acids content, unsaponifiable fraction of antioxidants, total phenols, polyphenols, carotenoids, vitamin C, total antioxidant activity, and mineral composition. No significant differences were observed for qualitative traits analyzed in wheat and corn samples. In tomato samples, the total antioxidant activity (TAA), measured by FRAP assay, and the naringenin content showed a lower value in genetically modified organism (GMO) samples (0.35 mmol of Fe (2+) 100 g (-1) and 2.82 mg 100 g (-1), respectively), in comparison to its nontransgenic control (0.41 mmol of Fe (2+) 100 g (-1) and 4.17 mg 100 g (-1), respectively). On the basis of the principle of substantial equivalence, as articulated by the World Health Organization, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, these data support the conclusion that GM events are nutritionally similar to conventional varieties of wheat, corn, and tomato on the market today."

"21689369","abstracttext","An HD-Zip IV gene from wheat, TaGL9, was isolated using a Y1H screen of a cDNA library prepared from developing wheat grain. TaGL9 has an amino acid sequence distinct from other reported members of the HD-Zip IV family. The 3' untranslated region of TaGL9 was used as a probe to isolate a genomic clone of the TaGL9 homologue from a BAC library prepared from Triticum durum L. cv. Langdon. The full-length gene containing a 3-kb-long promoter region was designated TdGL9H1. Spatial and temporal activity of TdGL9H1 was examined using promoter-GUS fusion constructs in transgenic wheat, barley and rice plants. Whole-mount and histochemical GUS staining patterns revealed grain-specific expression of TdGL9H1. GUS expression was initially observed between 3 and 8 days after pollination (DAP) in embryos at the globular stage and adjacent to the embryo fraction of the endosperm. Expression was strongest in the outer cell layer of the embryo. In developed wheat and barley embryos, strong activity of the promoter was only detected in the main vascular bundle of the scutellum, which is known to be responsible for the uptake of nutrients from the endosperm during germination and the endosperm-dependent phase of seedling development. Furthermore, this pattern of GUS staining was observed in dry seeds several weeks after harvesting but quickly disappeared during imbibition. The promoter of this gene could be a useful tool for engineering of early seedling vigour and protecting the endosperm to embryo axis pathway from pathogens during grain desiccation and storage."
"24652470","articletitle","Molecular and comparative mapping of genes governing spike compactness from wild emmer wheat."
"24652470","abstracttext","The development and morphology of the wheat spike is important because the spike is where reproduction occurs and it holds the grains until harvest. Therefore, genes that influence spike morphology are of interest from both theoretical and practical stand points. When substituted for the native chromosome 2A in the tetraploid Langdon (LDN) durum wheat background, the Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides chromosome 2A from accession IsraelA confers a short, compact spike with fewer spikelets per spike compared to LDN. Molecular mapping and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of these traits in a homozygous recombinant population derived from LDN × the chromosome 2A substitution line (LDNIsA-2A) indicated that the number of spikelets per spike and spike length were controlled by linked, but different, loci on the long arm of 2A. A QTL explaining most of the variation for spike compactness coincided with the QTL for spike length. Comparative mapping indicated that the QTL for number of spikelets per spike overlapped with a previously mapped QTL for Fusarium head blight susceptibility. The genes governing spike length and compactness were not orthologous to either sog or C, genes known to confer compact spikes in diploid and hexaploid wheat, respectively. Mapping and sequence analysis indicated that the gene governing spike length and compactness derived from wild emmer could be an ortholog of the barley Cly1/Zeo gene, which research indicates is an AP2-like gene pleiotropically affecting cleistogamy, flowering time, and rachis internode length. This work provides researchers with knowledge of new genetic loci and associated markers that may be useful for manipulating spike morphology in durum wheat."

"24955773","abstracttext","Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most important wheat diseases in the world. In this study, a single dominant powdery mildew resistance gene MlIW172 was identified in the IW172 wild emmer accession and mapped to the distal region of chromosome arm 7AL (bin7AL-16-0.86-0.90) via molecular marker analysis. MlIW172 was closely linked with the RFLP probe Xpsr680-derived STS marker Xmag2185 and the EST markers BE405531 and BE637476. This suggested that MlIW172 might be allelic to the Pm1 locus or a new locus closely linked to Pm1. By screening genomic BAC library of durum wheat cv. Langdon and 7AL-specific BAC library of hexaploid wheat cv. Chinese Spring, and after analyzing genome scaffolds of Triticum urartu containing the marker sequences, additional markers were developed to construct a fine genetic linkage map on the MlIW172 locus region and to delineate the resistance gene within a 0.48 cM interval. Comparative genetics analyses using ESTs and RFLP probe sequences flanking the MlIW172 region against other grass species revealed a general co-linearity in this region with the orthologous genomic regions of rice chromosome 6, Brachypodium chromosome 1, and sorghum chromosome 10. However, orthologous resistance gene-like RGA sequences were only present in wheat and Brachypodium. The BAC contigs and sequence scaffolds that we have developed provide a framework for the physical mapping and map-based cloning of MlIW172."

"32779520","abstracttext","In the last 20 years, severe wheat stem rust outbreaks have been recorded in Africa, Europe, and Central Asia. This previously well controlled disease, caused by the fungus Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici , has reemerged as a major threat to wheat cultivation. The stem rust ( Sr ) resistance gene Sr22 encodes a nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat receptor which confers resistance to the highly virulent African stem rust isolate Ug99. Here, we show that the Sr22 gene is conserved among grasses in the Triticeae and Poeae lineages. Triticeae species contain syntenic loci with single-copy orthologs of Sr22 on chromosome 7, except Hordeum vulgare , which has experienced major expansions and rearrangements at the locus. We also describe 14 Sr22 sequence variants obtained from both Triticum boeoticum and the domesticated form of this species, T. monococcum , which have been postulated to encode both functional and nonfunctional Sr22 alleles. The nucleotide sequence analysis of these alleles identified historical sequence exchange resulting from recombination or gene conversion, including breakpoints within codons, which expanded the coding potential at these positions by introduction of nonsynonymous substitutions. Three Sr22 alleles were transformed into wheat cultivar Fielder and two postulated resistant alleles from Schomburgk (hexaploid wheat introgressed with T. boeoticum segment carrying Sr22 ) and T. monococcum accession PI190945, respectively, conferred resistance to P. graminis f. sp. tritici race TTKSK, thereby unequivocally confirming Sr22 effectiveness against Ug99. The third allele from accession PI573523, previously believed to confer susceptibility, was confirmed as nonfunctional against Australian P. graminis f. sp. tritici race 98-1,2,3,5,6.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

"30288657","abstracttext","C2H2 type of zinc finger transcription factors (C2H2-ZFP TFs) play crucial roles in plant developments and stress response. Regarding its importance, genome-wide study of C2H2-ZFs were performed in multiple important plant species, but any such investigation was not fulfilled in Triticum turgidum ssp. Durum (durum wheat) as an important nutritional crop. The present study identified 122 C2H2-ZFs in durum wheat and physically mapped them onto the genome. The phylogenetic analysis classified these TFs into six major groups. Genes structure and conserved motifs assay showed TtC2H2-ZF involvement in the important cellular functions. Comparative phylogeny between durum wheat TtC2H2-ZF genes and the orthologs in rice revealed the evolutionary relationships of C2H2-ZF proteins. The gene ontology and promoter cis-element analysis indicated that most of TtC2H2-ZF genes are involved in multiple molecular functions including metal ion-binding and various stimuli responses. Further, the miRNAs targeting TtC2H2-ZF transcripts, homology modeling and proteins interaction network were also demonstrated, suggesting the vital cellular functions of TtC2H2-ZFs during various circumstances. The expression heatmap demonstrated differential and tissue-specific expression patterns of these genes. Expression profiling of this gene family members in response to dehydration and heat stresses showed differential expression pattern of these genes at multiple time points of stresses. This study can prepare a comprehensive overview of the durum wheat C2H2-ZF gene family and may provide a new perspective on the evolution of them, which will form the basis for further investigation of the roles of this family members and future genetic engineering studies in crops."

Nine strains of Klebsiella were isolated from rhizosphere of wheat (var. Lokwan) and identified as K. pneumoniae by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Six K. pneumoniae strains showed in vitro IAA production. Colorimetric analysis showed that K8 produced maximum IAA (27.5 mg l(-1)) in the presence of tryptophan (1 mg ml(-1)) at 72 h of incubation with optimum conditions as pH 8.0, 37 degrees C and 0.5% (w/v) NaCl concentration. GC-MS analysis and IR studies confirmed presence of IAA in the cell filtrates of strain K8. Effect of six IAA producing Klebsiella strains on plant growth was studied by performing series of seed germination tests using moth bean seeds under axenic conditions and pot experiments using sterilized soil and wheat seeds (var. Lokwan). Strain K11 and K42 demonstrated increase in root length of inoculated moth beans (approximately 92.71% over the control). Results of pot experiments indicated that almost all the six IAA producing Klebsiella strains significantly increased the root length and shoot height of inoculated wheat seedlings over the control. The results suggest that these are promising isolates from wheat rhizosphere and merits research on appliance of these strains in agriculture."

"15014981","abstracttext","The Hardness ( Ha) locus on chromosome 5D is the main determinant of grain texture in hexaploid wheat. The related genes Puroindoline-a and -b ( Pina-D1, Pinb-D1) and Grain Softness Protein ( Gsp-D1) are tightly linked at this locus. Mutations in the Pina-D1 and Pinb-D1 genes are associated with increased grain hardness. We report here the complete sequence of a 101-kb BAC clone from Triticum monococcum (A(m ) genome) which includes these three genes, and its comparison with the orthologous region in rice. The genes Gsp-A(m) 1, Pina-A(m) 1 and Pinb-A(m) 1 are separated by 37 kb and 32 kb, respectively, and are organized in the same transcriptional orientation. Four additional genes, including a pair of duplicated genes, were identified upstream of Gsp-A(m) 1 within a high-density gene island. These additional genes were found in the same order and orientation, and the same relative distances apart as similar genes previously annotated on rice chromosome 12. An interesting discovery was a small unannotated putative rice gene that was similar to the Gsp-A(m) 1 gene of T. monococcum (65% similarity at the protein level), and that was disposed in the same orientation, and located in the same position relative to the other orthologous genes. The high gene density observed in this BAC (1 gene per 14 kb) was expected for a distal chromosome region, but the level of microcolinearity with rice was higher than that reported in similar distal regions of other wheat chromosomes. Most of the BAC sequence (40%) was represented by repetitive elements, mainly concentrated in regions adjacent to the genes Pina-A(m) 1 and Pinb-A(m) 1. Rearrangements among these repetitive elements might provide an explanation for the frequent deletions observed at this locus in the genomes of the polyploid wheat species."

Comparison of the promoter region of several alpha/beta-gliadin and B-hordein genes reveals two conserved regions at about -130 and -250 bp. DNA from the hexaploid cultivars, Cheyenne and Chinese Spring, and the diploid progenitors T. urartu and Aegilops squarrosa was analysed by Southern blotting. Restriction fragment lengths of the alpha/beta-gliadin genes varied only slightly between the various wheats, although the overall copy number varied significantly. A region between approx. -1700 and -700 bp upstream from the TATA box was highly repeated in all three wheat genomes. For the hexaploid-derived gene, over 1700 bp of sequence upstream from the TATA box was determined, revealing an additional open reading frame between approx. -1550 and -1250 bp relative to the gliadin TATA box. Northern blot analysis indicated that RNA homologous to this repeated sequence family was present only in developing seed and accumulated to a maximum at late stages of maturation."

"12175077","abstracttext","The Lr20-Sr15-Pm1 resistance locus in hexaploid wheat confers resistance to three different fungal wheat pathogens (leaf rust, stem rust, and powdery mildew). It was previously localized in the distal region of chromosome arm 7AL. As a first step towards the isolation of this complex locus, we performed molecular mapping of the Lr20 and Pm1 genes in three F2 populations. In two populations, a cluster of 8 and 12 markers, respectively, cosegregated with the resistance genes. In a third population based on a cross between a susceptible lr20 mutant and a resistant cultivar, all clustered markers were monomorphic. However, in this population the recombination frequency proximal to the Lr20 gene was up to 60 times higher, indicating that the complete genetic linkage of the clustered markers is not due to a close physical linkage of the probes but is caused by suppressed recombination. This was supported by the analysis of Triticum monococcum BAC clones where no physical linkage between cosegregating probes was observed. Suppressed recombination at the Lr20-Pm1 locus is likely the result of an alien introgression of chromatin from an unidentified wild relative species or is due to chromosomal rearrangements."

Inheritance studies indicated monogenic control of resistance. The resistance gene was tentatively designated as Yrvav and was located on chromosome 1B by monosomic analysis. A close association (1.5+/-0.9% recombination) of Yrvav with a T. vavilovii-derived gliadin allele ( Gli-B1vav) placed it in chromosome arm 1BS. Yrvavwas allelic with Yr10. Tests with Yr10 avirulent and virulent pathotypes showed that Yrvav and Yr10 possess identical pathogenic specificity. Yrvav and Yr10 showed close genetic associations with alternate alleles at the Xpsp3000(microsatellite marker), Gli-B1 and Rg1 loci. Based on these observations Yrvav was named as Yr10vav. The close association between Xpsp3000 and Gli-B1 was also confirmed. The Yr10vav-linked Xpsp3000 allele (285 bp) was not present in 65 Australian cultivars, whereas seven Australian wheats lacking Yr10 carried the same Xpsp3000 allele (260 bp) as Yr10carrying wheat cultivar Moro. Xpsp3000 and/or Gli-B1 could be used in marker-assisted selection for pyramiding Yr10vavor Yr10 with other stripe rust resistance genes. Yr10vav was inherited independently of the T. vavilovii-derived RWA resistance."

SW8 was resistant to the Hessian fly biotype Great Plains (GP) and strain vH13 (virulent to H13). SW34 was resistant to biotype GP, but susceptible to strain vH13. Allelism tests indicated that resistance genes in SW8 and SW34 may be allelic to H26 and H13 or correspond to paralogs at both loci, respectively. H26 and H13 were localized to chromosome 4D and 6D, respectively, in previous studies. Molecular mapping in the present study, however, assigned the H26 locus to chromosome 3D rather than 4D. On the other hand, mapping of the resistance gene in SW34 verified the previous assignment of the H13 locus to chromosome 6D. Linkage analysis and physical mapping positioned the H26 locus to the chromosomal deletion bin 3DL3-0.81-1.00.

"17176393","abstracttext","* Fructans are believed to contribute to cold and drought tolerance in several plant families (Poaceae, Asparagaceae and Asteraceae), but it is not clear why the ability to accumulate these polymers is found in some genera (e.g. Triticum) but not in others (e.g. Oryza). * As fructan biosynthesis enzymes (FBEs) evolved from vacuolar invertases (VINs), we searched the rice genome sequence for genes related to both FBE and VIN genes of wheat and other members of the Pooideae. We compared them at the levels of exon-intron structure, protein sequence, and the enzymatic properties of recombinant proteins after expression in the yeast Pichia pastoris. * We found that rice possesses two VIN genes (OsVIN1 and OsVIN2) and no FBE genes. FBE genes appear to have arisen in the Pooideae by a series of gene duplications from an ancestor of wheat TaVIN3. Recombinant TaVIN2, OsVIN1 and OsVIN2 behaved as invertases with no FBE activity, but possessed high fructan exohydrolase activity, especially OsVIN1. * The engineering of fructan accumulation into rice for greater stress tolerance could founder on endogenous exohydrolases, but the fact that OsVIN1 transcripts are absent from peduncles of well watered and drought-stressed plants removes one potential obstacle to this endeavour."
"17905866","articletitle","A universal expression/silencing vector in plants."
"17905866","abstracttext","A universal vector (IL-60 and auxiliary constructs), expressing or silencing genes in every plant tested to date, is described. Plants that have been successfully manipulated by the IL-60 system include hard-to-manipulate species such as wheat (Triticum duram), pepper (Capsicum annuum), grapevine (Vitis vinifera), citrus, and olive (Olea europaea). Expression or silencing develops within a few days in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), wheat, and most herbaceous plants and in up to 3 weeks in woody trees. Expression, as tested in tomato, is durable and persists throughout the life span of the plant. The vector is, in fact, a disarmed form of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus, which is applied as a double-stranded DNA and replicates as such. However, the disarmed virus does not support rolling-circle replication, and therefore viral progeny single-stranded DNA is not produced. IL-60 does not integrate into the plant's genome, and the construct, including the expressed gene, is not heritable. IL-60 is not transmitted by the Tomato yellow leaf curl virus's natural insect vector. In addition, artificial satellites were constructed that require a helper virus for replication, movement, and expression. With IL-60 as the disarmed helper ""virus,"" transactivation occurs, resulting in an inducible expressing/silencing system. The system's potential is demonstrated by IL-60-derived suppression of a viral-silencing suppressor of Grapevine virus A, resulting in Grapevine virus A-resistant/tolerant plants."

"24166432","abstracttext","Of the more than 50,000 edible plant species in the world, at least 10,000 species are cereal grains. Three major cereal crops, rice (Oryza sativa), maize (Zea mays), and wheat (Triticum sp.), provide two-thirds of the world's food energy intake. Although crop yields have improved tremendously thanks to technological advances in the past 50 years, population increases and climate changes continue to threaten the sustainability of current crop productions. Whereas conventional and marker-assisted breeding programs continue to play a major role in crop improvement, genetic engineering has drawn an intense worldwide interest from the scientific community. In the past decade, genetic transformation technologies have revolutionized agricultural practices and millions of hectares of biotech crops have been cultured. Because of its unique ability to insert well-characterized gene sequences into the plant genome, genetic engineering can also provide effective tools to address fundamental biological questions. This technology is expected to continue to be an indispensable approach for both basic and applied research. Here, we overview briefly the development of the genetic transformation in the top seven cereals, namely maize, rice, wheat, barley (Hordeum vulgare), sorghum (Sorghum sp.), oat (Avena sativa), and millets. The advantages and disadvantages of the two major transformation methods, Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated and biolistic methods, are also discussed."

"30870941","abstracttext","Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum) cultivars developed by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) are currently grown on more than 8 million hectares worldwide. Because of the lack of information on the genetic basis of resistance to stripe rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis), crosses in a diallel arrangement (without reciprocals) were made among five worldwide resistant cultivars and the susceptible cultivar Local Red. Inheritance of resistance was investigated in seedling and adult plant growth stages of F 2 populations, and F 3 lines. The low seedling infection type of each resistant cultivar, namely Kroub 76, Chonta Inia, Sna 3, Syros, and Arena, was based on the additive action of the same two genes. Each of these genes conferred intermediate infection types when present alone. The field resistance of the cultivars was based on the additive action of the two genes identified in the seedlings and one additional, partially effective adult resistance gene. Segregation for plants with stripe rust severities higher than that of the parents in intercrosses of resistant cultivars indicated that some genetic diversity exists for adult genes. The resistance of these cultivars may prove to be long-lasting, since it results from the combined action of at least three genes."
"31942623","articletitle","Three previously characterized resistances to yellow rust are encoded by a single locus Wtk1."
"31942623","abstracttext","The wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides; WEW) yellow (stripe) rust resistance genes Yr15, YrG303, and YrH52 were discovered in natural populations from different geographic locations. They all localize to chromosome 1B but were thought to be non-allelic based on differences in resistance response. We recently cloned Yr15 as a Wheat Tandem Kinase 1 (WTK1) and show here that these three resistance loci co-segregate in fine-mapping populations and share an identical full-length genomic sequence of functional Wtk1. Independent ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized susceptible yrG303 and yrH52 lines carried single nucleotide mutations in Wtk1 that disrupted function. A comparison of the mutations for yr15, yrG303, and yrH52 mutants showed that while key conserved residues were intact, other conserved regions in critical kinase subdomains were frequently affected. Thus, we concluded that Yr15-, YrG303-, and YrH52-mediated resistances to yellow rust are encoded by a single locus, Wtk1. Introgression of Wtk1 into multiple genetic backgrounds resulted in variable phenotypic responses, confirming that Wtk1-mediated resistance is part of a complex immune response network. WEW natural populations subjected to natural selection and adaptation have potential to serve as a good source for evolutionary studies of different traits and multifaceted gene networks."

Additionally, a set of cv. Thatcher near-isogenic lines conferring resistance genes Lr 1, Lr 9, Lr 10, Lr 24, Lr 28, Lr 35 and Lr 37 were examined with the same procedure. Twenty-two accessions were tested using the inoculation test for resistance to Erysiphe graminis, Puccinia recondita, P. striiformis and P. graminis. The most resistant entries were those of Aegilops speltoides and Triticum timopheevi and among T. boeoticum accession #5353. Markers of all mentioned Lr resistance genes were identified in all corresponding cv. Thatcher near-isogenic lines (except Lr 35 gene marker). The following resistance gene markers were identified in wild Triticeae accessions: Lr 1 in two accessions of Ae. tauschii and one accession of Ae. umbellulata, Lr 9 in one accession of Ae. umbellulata, Lr 10 in one accession of T. spelta, Lr 28 in 11 accessions: Ae. speltoides (4), Ae. umbellulata (2), T. spelta (2) and T. timopheevi (3), Lr 37 in 3 accessions of Ae. ventricosa, Pm 1 in all 34 accessions, Pm 2 in 28 accessions, Pm 3 in all 4 accessions of T. boeoticum, 1 accession of T. spelta and 1 of T. timopheevi, and Pm 13 in 5 out of 6 accessions of Ae. speltoides.

In the current study, wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides), the progenitor of domesticated wheat, was tested for (1) genetic diversity in grain nutrient concentrations, (2) associations among grain nutrients and their relationships with plant productivity, and (3) the association of grain nutrients with the eco-geographical origin of wild emmer accessions."
"20202969","abstracttext_methods","A total of 154 genotypes, including wild emmer accessions from across the Near Eastern Fertile Crescent and diverse wheat cultivars, were characterized in this 2-year field study for grain protein, micronutrient (zinc, iron, copper and manganese) and macronutrient (calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus and sulphur) concentrations."
"20202969","abstracttext_key results","Wide genetic diversity was found among the wild emmer accessions for all grain nutrients. The concentrations of grain zinc, iron and protein in wild accessions were about two-fold greater than in the domesticated genotypes. Concentrations of these compounds were positively correlated with one another, with no clear association with plant productivity, suggesting that all three nutrients can be improved concurrently with no yield penalty. A subset of 12 populations revealed significant genetic variation between and within populations for all minerals. Association between soil characteristics at the site of collection and grain nutrient concentrations showed negative associations between soil clay content and grain protein and between soil-extractable zinc and grain zinc, the latter suggesting that the greatest potential for grain nutrient minerals lies in populations from micronutrient-deficient soils."

"20591144","abstracttext_background","Sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) is an important component of the plant sucrose biosynthesis pathway. In the monocotyledonous Poaceae, five SPS genes have been identified. Here we present a detailed analysis of the wheat SPSII family in wheat. A set of homoeologue-specific primers was developed in order to permit both the detection of sequence variation, and the dissection of the individual contribution of each homoeologue to the global expression of SPSII."
"20591144","abstracttext_results","The expression in bread wheat over the course of development of various sucrose biosynthesis genes monitored on an Affymetrix array showed that the SPS genes were regulated over time and space. SPSII homoeologue-specific assays were used to show that the three homoeologues contributed differentially to the global expression of SPSII. Genetic mapping placed the set of homoeoloci on the short arms of the homoeologous group 3 chromosomes. A resequencing of the A and B genome copies allowed the detection of four haplotypes at each locus. The 3B copy includes an unspliced intron. A comparison of the sequences of the wheat SPSII orthologues present in the diploid progenitors einkorn, goatgrass and Triticum speltoides, as well as in the more distantly related species barley, rice, sorghum and purple false brome demonstrated that intronic sequence was less well conserved than exonic. Comparative sequence and phylogenetic analysis of SPSII gene showed that false purple brome was more similar to Triticeae than to rice. Wheat - rice synteny was found to be perturbed at the SPS region."

DArT (Diversity Arrays Technology) employs a hybridisation-based approach to type thousands of genomic loci in parallel. DArT markers were developed for T. monococcum to assess genetic diversity, compare relationships with hexaploid genomes, and construct a genetic linkage map integrating DArT and microsatellite markers."
"19788762","abstracttext_results","A DArT array, consisting of 2304 hexaploid wheat, 1536 tetraploid wheat, 1536 T. monococcum as well as 1536 T. boeoticum representative genomic clones, was used to fingerprint 16 T. monococcum accessions of diverse geographical origins. In total, 846 polymorphic DArT markers were identified, of which 317 were of T. monococcum origin, 246 of hexaploid, 157 of tetraploid, and 126 of T. boeoticum genomes. The fingerprinting data indicated that the geographic origin of T. monococcum accessions was partially correlated with their genetic variation. DArT markers could also well distinguish the genetic differences amongst a panel of 23 hexaploid wheat and nine T. monococcum genomes. For the first time, 274 DArT markers were integrated with 82 simple sequence repeat (SSR) and two morphological trait loci in a genetic map spanning 1062.72 cM in T. monococcum. Six chromosomes were represented by single linkage groups, and chromosome 4Am was formed by three linkage groups. The DArT and SSR genetic loci tended to form independent clusters along the chromosomes. Segregation distortion was observed for one third of the DArT loci. The Ba (black awn) locus was refined to a 23.2 cM region between the DArT marker locus wPt-2584 and the microsatellite locus Xgwmd33 on 1Am; and the Hl (hairy leaf) locus to a 4.0 cM region between DArT loci 376589 and 469591 on 5Am."

"27085709","abstracttext","Wheat cultivars exposed to optimal photoperiod and vernalization treatments still exhibit differences in flowering time, referred to as earliness per se (Eps). We previously identified the Eps-A (m) 1 locus from Triticum monococcum and showed that the allele from cultivated accession DV92 significantly delays heading time and increases the number of spikelets per spike relative to the allele from wild accession G3116. Here, we expanded a high-density genetic and physical map of the Eps-A (m) 1 region and identified the wheat ortholog of circadian clock regulator EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3) as a candidate gene. No differences in ELF3 transcript levels were found between near-isogenic lines carrying the DV92 and G3116 Eps-A (m) 1 alleles, but the encoded ELF3 proteins differed in four amino acids. These differences were associated with altered transcription profiles of PIF-like, PPD1, and FT1, which are known downstream targets of ELF3. Tetraploid wheat lines with combined truncation mutations in the A- and B-genome copies of ELF3 flowered earlier and had less spikelets per spike than the wild-type control under short- and long-day conditions. Both effects were stronger in a photoperiod-sensitive than in a reduced photoperiod-sensitive background, indicating a significant epistatic interaction between PPD1 and ELF3 (P < 0.0001). By contrast, the introgression of the T. monococcum chromosome segment carrying the Eps-A (m) 1 allele from DV92 into durum wheat delayed flowering and increased the number of spikelets per spike. Taken together, the above results support the hypothesis that ELF3 is Eps-A (m) 1. The ELF3 alleles identified here provide additional tools to modulate reproductive development in wheat."

The combination of Oligo-pTa535-HM and Oligo-pSc119.2-HM can differentiate A b and A chromosomes within homologous groups 2, 4, 5, and 6; chromosomes 2A b and 6A b can be identified by using (ACT) 7 , (CTT) 7 , and (GAA) 7 .

"32481482","abstracttext","The destructive wheat powdery mildew disease is caused by the fungal pathogen Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici ( Bgt ). PmG3M , derived from wild emmer wheat Triticum dicoccoides accession G305-3M, is a major gene providing a wide-spectrum resistance against Bgt . PmG3M was previously mapped to wheat chromosome 6B using an F 6 recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping population generated by crossing G305-3M with the susceptible T. durum wheat cultivar Langdon (LDN). In the current study, we aimed to explore the defense mechanisms conferred by PmG3M against Bgt. Histopathology of fungal development was characterized in artificially inoculated leaves of G305-3M, LDN, and homozygous RILs using fluorescence and light microscopy. G305-3M exhibited H 2 O 2 accumulation typical of a hypersensitive response, which resulted in programmed cell death (PCD) in Bgt-penetrated epidermal cells, while LDN showed well-developed colonies without PCD. In addition, we observed a post-haustorial resistance mechanism that arrested the development of fungal feeding structures and pathogen growth in both G305-3M and resistant RIL, while LDN and a susceptible RIL displayed fully developed digitated haustoria and massive accumulation of fungal biomass. In contrast, both G305-3M and LDN exhibited callose deposition in attempt to prevent fungal invasion, supporting this as a mechanism of a basal defense response not associated with PmG3M resistance mechanism per se . The presented results shed light on the resistance mechanisms conferred by PmG3M against wheat powdery mildew."

"30326849","abstracttext_background","Among cereals, durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. subsp. durum) accumulates cadmium (Cd) at higher concentration if grown in Cd-polluted soils. Since cadmium accumulation is a risk for human health, the international trade organizations have limited the acceptable concentration of Cd in edible crops. Therefore, durum wheat cultivars accumulating low cadmium in grains should be preferred by farmers and consumers. To identify the response of durum wheat to the presence of Cd, the transcriptomes of roots and shoots of Creso and Svevo cultivars were sequenced after a 50-day exposure to 0.5 μM Cd in hydroponic solution."
"30326849","abstracttext_results","No phytotoxic effects or biomass reduction was observed in Creso and Svevo plants at this Cd concentration. Despite this null effect, cadmium was accumulated in root tissues, in shoots and in grains suggesting a good cadmium translocation rate among tissues. The mRNA sequencing revealed a general transcriptome rearrangement after Cd treatment and more than 7000 genes were found differentially expressed in root and shoot tissues. Among these, the up-regulated genes in roots showed a clear correlation with cadmium uptake and detoxification. In particular, about three hundred genes were commonly up-regulated in Creso and Svevo roots suggesting a well defined molecular strategy characterized by the transcriptomic activation of several transcription factors mainly belonging to bHLH and WRKY families. bHLHs are probably the activators of the strong up-regulation of three NAS genes, responsible for the synthesis of the phytosiderophore nicotianamine (NA). Moreover, we found the overall up-regulation of the methionine salvage pathway that is tightly connected with NA synthesis and supply the S-adenosyl methionine necessary for NA biosynthesis. Finally, several vacuolar NA chelating heavy metal transporters were vigorously activated."
"30326849","abstracttext_conclusions","In conclusion, the exposure of durum wheat to cadmium activates in roots a complex gene network involved in cadmium translocation and detoxification from heavy metals.

"31322493","abstracttext","Viral diseases are a limiting factor to wheat production. Viruses are difficult to diagnose in the early stages of disease development and are often confused with nutrient deficiencies or other abiotic problems. Immunological methods are useful to identify viruses, but specific antibodies may not be available or require high virus titer for detection. In 2015 and 2017, wheat plants containing Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) resistance gene, Wsm2 , were found to have symptoms characteristic of WSMV. Serologically, WSMV was detected in all four samples. Additionally, High Plains wheat mosaic virus (HPWMoV) was also detected in one of the samples. Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) was not detected, and a detection kit was not readily available for Triticum mosaic virus (TriMV). Initially, cDNA cloning and Sanger sequencing were used to determine the presence of WSMV; however, the process was time-consuming and expensive. Subsequently, cDNA from infected wheat tissue was sequenced with single-strand, Oxford Nanopore sequencing technology (ONT). ONT was able to confirm the presence of WSMV. Additionally, TriMV was found in all of the samples and BYDV in three of the samples. Deep coverage sequencing of full-length, single-strand WSMV revealed variation compared with the WSMV Sidney-81 reference strain and may represent new variants which overcome Wsm2 . These results demonstrate that ONT can more accurately identify causal virus agents and has sufficient resolution to provide evidence of causal variants."

"32920225","abstracttext","Drought is the most important abiotic stress limiting wheat production worldwide. Triticum boeoticum, as wild wheat, is a rich gene pool for breeding for drought stress tolerance. In this study, to identify the most drought-tolerant and susceptible genotypes, ten T. boeoticum accessions were evaluated under non-stress and drought-stress conditions for two years. Among the studied traits, water-use efficiency (WUE) was suggested as the most important trait to identify drought-tolerant genotypes. According to the desirable and undesirable areas of the bi-plot, Tb5 and Tb6 genotypes were less and more affected by drought stress, respectively. Therefore, their flag-leaves proteins were used for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. While, Tb5 contained a high amount of yield, yield components, and WUE, Tb6 had higher levels of water use, phenological related traits, and root related characters. Of the 235 spots found in the studied accessions, 14 spots (11 and 3 spots of Tb5 and Tb6, respectively) were selected for sequencing. Of these 14 spots, 9 and 5 spots were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. The identified proteins were grouped into six functional protein clusters, which were mainly involved in photosynthesis (36%), carbohydrate metabolism (29%), chaperone (7%), oxidation and reduction (7%), lipid metabolism and biological properties of the membrane (7%) and unknown function (14%). We report for the first time that MICP, in the group of lipid metabolism proteins, was significantly changed into wild wheat in response to drought stress. Maybe, the present-identified proteins could play an important role to understand the molecular pathways of wheat drought tolerance. We believe comparing and evaluating the similarity-identified proteins of T. boeoticum with the previously identified proteins of Aegilops tauschii, can provide a new direction to improve wheat tolerance to drought stress."

"32849748","abstracttext","Wheat is among the important crops harnessed by humans whose breeding efforts resulted in a diversity of genotypes with contrasting traits. The goal of this study was to determine whether different old and new cultivars of durum wheat ( Triticum turgidum L. var. durum ) recruit specific arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal communities from indigenous AM fungal populations of soil under field conditions. A historical set of five landraces and 26 durum wheat cultivars were field cultivated in a humid climate in Eastern Canada, under phosphorus-limiting conditions. To characterize the community of AMF inhabiting bulk soil, rhizosphere, and roots, MiSeq amplicon sequencing targeting the 18S rRNA gene (SSU) was performed on total DNAs using a nested PCR approach. Mycorrhizal colonization was estimated using root staining and microscope observations. A total of 317 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were identified as belonging to Glomeromycota. The core AM fungal community (i.e., ASVs present in > 50% of the samples) in the soil, rhizosphere, and root included 29, 30, and 29 ASVs, respectively. ASVs from the genera Funneliformis , Claroideoglomus , and Rhizophagus represented 37%, 18.6%, and 14.7% of the sequences recovered in the rarefied dataset, respectively. The two most abundant ASVs had sequence homology with the 18S sequences from well-identified herbarium cultures of Funneliformis mosseae BEG12 and Rhizophagus irregularis DAOM 197198, while the third most abundant ASV was assigned to the genus Paraglomus . Cultivars showed no significant difference of the percentage of root colonization ranging from 57.8% in Arnautka to 84.0% in AC Navigator. Cultivars were generally associated with similar soil, rhizosphere, and root communities, but the abundance of F. mosseae , R. irregularis , and Claroideoglomus sp. sequences varied in Eurostar, Golden Ball, and Wakooma. Although these results were obtained in one field trial using a non-restricted pool of durum wheat and at the time of sampling, that may have filtered the community in biotopes. The low genetic variation between durum wheat cultivars for the diversity of AM symbiosis at the species level suggests breeding resources need not be committed to leveraging plant selective influence through the use of traditional methods for genotype development."

"19712486","abstracttext_background","Wheat (Triticum ssp.) is an important food source for humans in many regions around the world. However, the ability to understand and modify gene function for crop improvement is hindered by the lack of available genomic resources. TILLING is a powerful reverse genetics approach that combines chemical mutagenesis with a high-throughput screen for mutations. Wheat is specially well-suited for TILLING due to the high mutation densities tolerated by polyploids, which allow for very efficient screens. Despite this, few TILLING populations are currently available. In addition, current TILLING screening protocols require high-throughput genotyping platforms, limiting their use."
"19712486","abstracttext_results","We developed mutant populations of pasta and common wheat and organized them for TILLING. To simplify and decrease costs, we developed a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel set-up that uses ethidium bromide to detect fragments generated by crude celery juice extract digestion of heteroduplexes. This detection method had similar sensitivity as traditional LI-COR screens, suggesting that it represents a valid alternative. We developed genome-specific primers to circumvent the presence of multiple homoeologous copies of our target genes. Each mutant library was characterized by TILLING multiple genes, revealing high mutation densities in both the hexaploid (~1/38 kb) and tetraploid (~1/51 kb) populations for 50% GC targets. These mutation frequencies predict that screening 1,536 lines for an effective target region of 1.3 kb with 50% GC content will result in ~52 hexaploid and ~39 tetraploid mutant alleles. This implies a high probability of obtaining knock-out alleles (P = 0.91 for hexaploid, P = 0.84 for tetraploid), in addition to multiple missense mutations. In total, we identified over 275 novel alleles in eleven targeted gene/genome combinations in hexaploid and tetraploid wheat and have validated the presence of a subset of them in our seed stock."
"19712486","abstracttext_conclusion","We have generated reverse genetics TILLING resources for pasta and bread wheat and achieved a high mutation density in both populations.

"15480533","abstracttext","Vernalization, the requirement of a long exposure to low temperatures to induce flowering, is an essential adaptation of plants to cold winters. We have shown recently that the vernalization gene VRN-1 from diploid wheat Triticum monococcum is the meristem identity gene APETALA1, and that deletions in its promoter were associated with spring growth habit. In this study, we characterized the allelic variation at the VRN-1 promoter region in polyploid wheat. The Vrn-A1a allele has a duplication including the promoter region. Each copy has similar foldback elements inserted at the same location and is flanked by identical host direct duplications (HDD). This allele was found in more than half of the hexaploid varieties but not among the tetraploid lines analyzed here. The Vrn-A1b allele has two mutations in the HDD region and a 20-bp deletion in the 5' UTR compared with the winter allele. The Vrn-A1b allele was found in both tetraploid and hexaploid accessions but at a relatively low frequency. Among the tetraploid wheat accessions, we found two additional alleles with 32 bp and 54 bp deletions that included the HDD region. We found no size polymorphisms in the promoter region among the winter wheat varieties. The dominant Vrn-A1 allele from two spring varieties from Afghanistan and Egypt ( Vrn-A1c allele) and all the dominant Vrn-B1 and Vrn-D1 alleles included in this study showed no differences from their respective recessive alleles in promoter sequences. Based on these results, we concluded that the VRN-1 genes should have additional regulatory sites outside the promoter region studied here."

"20559817","abstracttext","Some durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var durum) cultivars have the genetic propensity to accumulate cadmium (Cd) in the grain. A major gene controlling grain Cd concentration designated as Cdu1 has been reported on 5B, but the genetic factor(s) conferring the low Cd phenotype are currently unknown. The objectives of this study were to saturate the chromosomal region harboring Cdu1 with newly developed PCR-based markers and to investigate the colinearity of this wheat chromosomal region with rice (Oryza sativa L.) and Brachypodium distachyon genomes. Genetic mapping of markers linked to Cdu1 in a population of recombinant inbred substitution lines revealed that the gene(s) associated with variation in Cd concentration resides in wheat bin 5BL9 between fraction breakpoints 0.76 and 0.79. Genetic mapping and quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of grain Cd concentration was performed in 155 doubled haploid lines from the cross W9262-260D3 (low Cd) by Kofa (high Cd) revealed two expressed sequence tag markers (ESMs) and one sequence tagged site (STS) marker that co-segregated with Cdu1 and explained >80% of the phenotypic variation in grain Cd concentration. A second, minor QTL for grain Cd concentration was also identified on 5B, 67 cM proximal to Cdu1. The Cdu1 interval spans 286 kbp of rice chromosome 3 and 282 kbp of Brachypodium chromosome 1. The markers and rice and Brachypodium colinearity described here represent tools that will assist in the positional cloning of Cdu1 and can be used to select for low Cd accumulation in durum wheat breeding programs targeting this trait. The isolation of Cdu1 will further our knowledge of Cd accumulation in cereals as well as metal accumulation in general."
"21838777","articletitle","TaMYB13 is a transcriptional activator of fructosyltransferase genes involved in β-2,6-linked fructan synthesis in wheat."
"21838777","abstracttext","Fructans are soluble fructosyl-oligosaccharides deposited in many cool-season grass species as a carbon reserve; they are synthesised by fructosyltransferases. In wheat and barley fructans can accumulate in mature stems at a very high level and serve as an important carbon source for grain filling. Fructan synthesis in temperate cereals is regulated by sucrose level and developmental signals, and functions as a metabolic adjustment for carbon balance between carbon supply and sink demand. In this study the expression levels of a highly homologous group of Triticum aestivumMYB genes (TaMYB13-1, TaMYB13-2 and TaMYB13-3) were found to be positively correlated with the mRNA levels of sucrose:sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase (1-SST) and sucrose:fructan 6-fructosyltransferase (6-SFT) in wheat stems among recombinant inbred lines with a wide range of fructan concentrations through Affymetrix array expression analysis. This expression correction extended to expression profiles during stem development. TaMYB13 contains an R2R3-type MYB domain. In vitro random DNA-binding site selection followed by base substitution mutagenesis revealed that TaMYB13 bound to a (A/G/T)TT(A/T/C)GGT core sequence, which was present in the promoters of wheat Ta1-SST and Ta6-SFT genes as well as a barley Hv6-SFT gene. Transactivation analysis showed that TaMYB13 was a transcriptional activator and could markedly enhance the expression of 1-SST and 6-SFT promoter-driven reporter genes in wheat. Elimination of TaMYB13-binding sites in Ta6-SFT and Ta1-SST promoters markedly reduced TaMYB13-mediated reporter gene transactivation. These data suggest that TaMYB13 and its orthologues are positive regulators for controlling the expression of major fructosyltransferases involved in the fructan synthetic pathway in temperate cereals."

"22213809","abstracttext","The TaPR61 gene from bread wheat encodes a lipid transfer protein (LTP) with a hydrophobic signal peptide, predicted to direct the TaPR61 protein to the apoplast. Modelling of TaPR61 revealed the presence of an internal cavity which can accommodate at least two lipid molecules. The full-length gene, including the promoter sequence of a TaPR61 orthologue, was cloned from a BAC library of Triticum durum. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed the presence of TaPR61 and TdPR61 mainly in grain. A transcriptional TdPR61 promoter-GUS fusion was stably transformed into wheat, barley, and rice. The strongest GUS expression in all three plants was found in the endosperm transfer cells, the embryo surrounding region (ESR), and in the embryo. The promoter is strong and has similar but not identical spatial patterns of activity in wheat, barley, and rice. These results suggest that the TdPR61 promoter will be a useful tool for improving grain quality by manipulating the quality and quantity of nutrient/lipid uptake to the endosperm and embryo. Mapping of regions important for the promoter function using transient expression assays in developing embryos resulted in the identification of two segments important for promoter activation in embryos. The putative cis-elements from the distal segment were used as bait in a yeast 1-hybrid (Y1H) screen of a cDNA library prepared from the liquid part of the wheat multinucleate syncytium. A transcription factor isolated in the screen is similar to BES1/BLZ1 from Arabidopsis, which is known to be a key transcriptional regulator of the brassinosteroid signalling pathway."

"28034841","abstracttext","Wheat stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis West. f. sp. tritici Eriks. ＆Henn. (Pst), is a serious fungal disease. Identification of new genes associate with stripe rust resistance is important for developing disease resistant wheat cultivars and studying the mechanism of disease resistance. Trihelix is a plant specific transcription factor family, which is involved in regulation of growth and development, morphogenesis, and response to stresses. So far, no study reports on the relationship between the Trihelix family and wheat stripe rust. In this study, a gene in the GTγ subfamily of Trihelix family, designated TuGTγ-3, was cloned from Triticum urartu Tum. (2n=2x=14, AA). The results of sequencing demonstrated that TuGTγ-3 gene consisted of a complete open reading frame (ORF), and its coding sequence was 1329 bp in length, which encoded a protein with 442 amino acids. The predicted molecular weight of this protein was 50.31 kDa and the theoretical isoelectric point was 6.12. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that TuGTγ-3 protein had a monopartite nuclear localization signal (GLPMQKKMRYT), and had neither transmembrane domain nor signal peptide. The conserved trihelix domain, the fourth α-helix and the CC domain were located in the regions of Q115?R187, F234?Y241 and K362?K436, respectively. Dissection of secondary structure showed that TuGTγ-3 protein comprised of 43.89% α-helix, 9.51% extended strand, 9.95% β-turn and 36.65% random coil structures. Based on the BLAST search against the genome database of common wheat from IWGSC, TuGTγ-3 was located on the long arm of chromosome 5A. Transient expression experiment using onion inner epidermal cell showed that the fusion protein TuGTγ-3-GFP distributed mainly in nuclear and slightly in cytoplasm. Expression profiles in different organs indicated that expression level of TuGTγ-3 was much higher in leaves than that in roots or leaf sheaths, and the expression in leaves was extremely up-regulated by infection of the Pst race CYR32. Furthermore, the BSMV-VIGS experiment demonstrated that the transcription factor TuGTγ-3 positively regulated resistance to stripe rust in T. urartu."
"28955352","articletitle","Haplotype Analysis of the Pre-harvest Sprouting Resistance Locus Phs-A1 Reveals a Causal Role of TaMKK3-A in Global Germplasm."
"28955352","abstracttext","Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) is an important cause of quality loss in many cereal crops and is particularly prevalent and damaging in wheat. Resistance to PHS is therefore a valuable target trait in many breeding programs. The Phs-A1 locus on wheat chromosome arm 4AL has been consistently shown to account for a significant proportion of natural variation to PHS in diverse mapping populations. However, the deployment of sprouting resistance is confounded by the fact that different candidate genes, including the tandem duplicated Plasma Membrane 19 ( PM19 ) genes and the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 ( TaMKK3-A) gene, have been proposed to underlie Phs-A1 . To further define the Phs-A1 locus, we constructed a physical map across this interval in hexaploid and tetraploid wheat. We established close proximity of the proposed candidate genes which are located within a 1.2 Mb interval. Genetic characterization of diverse germplasm used in previous genetic mapping studies suggests that TaMKK3-A , and not PM19 , is the major gene underlying the Phs-A1 effect in European, North American, Australian and Asian germplasm. We identified the non-dormant TaMKK3-A allele at low frequencies within the A-genome diploid progenitor Triticum urartu genepool, and show an increase in the allele frequency in modern varieties. In United Kingdom varieties, the frequency of the dormant TaMKK3-A allele was significantly higher in bread-making quality varieties compared to feed and biscuit-making cultivars. Analysis of exome capture data from 58 diverse hexaploid wheat accessions identified fourteen haplotypes across the extended Phs-A1 locus and four haplotypes for TaMKK3-A . Analysis of these haplotypes in a collection of United Kingdom and Australian cultivars revealed distinct major dormant and non-dormant Phs-A1 haplotypes in each country, which were either rare or absent in the opposing germplasm set. The diagnostic markers and haplotype information reported in the study will help inform the choice of germplasm and breeding strategies for the deployment of Phs-A1 resistance into breeding germplasm."

Development and deployment of sequence-based markers has opened avenues for comparative analysis, gene transfer and marker assisted selection (MAS) using high throughput cost effective genotyping techniques.

The present study aimed at identification of genic sequences corresponding to full length cDNAs and mining of SSRs and ISBPs from 2A draft sequence assembly of hexaploid wheat cv. Chinese Spring for marker development. In total, 1029 primer pairs including 478 gene derived, 501 SSRs and 50 ISBPs were amplified in diploid A genome species Triticum monococcum and T. boeoticum identifying 221 polymorphic loci. Out of these, 119 markers were mapped onto a pre-existing chromosome 2A genetic map consisting of 42 mapped markers. The enriched genetic map constituted 161 mapped markers with final map length of 549.6 cM. Further, 2A genetic map of T. monococcum was anchored to the physical map of 2A of cv. Chinese Spring which revealed several rearrangements between the two species. The present study generated a highly saturated genetic map of 2A and physical anchoring of genetically mapped markers revealed a complex genetic architecture of chromosome 2A that needs to be investigated further."

Cultivated tetraploid emmer wheats (T. turgidum s. l.) and hexaploid bread wheats (T. aestivum s. l.) are all fixed for a heterozygous triplet, E(0.58)/E(0.64). The slowest isoenzyme, E(0.58), is controlled by a homoeoallelic gene on the chromosome arm 6AL of T. aestivum cv. 'Chinese Spring' and is inherent in all diploid wheats, T. monococcum s. Str., T. boeoticum s. l. and T. urartu. The fastest isoenzyme, E(0.64), is presumably controlled by the B- and D-genome homoeoalleles of the bread wheat and is the commonest alloenzyme of diploid goat-grasses, including Ae. speltaides and Ae. tauschii. The tetraploid T. timopheevii s. str. has a particular heterozygous triplet E(0.56)/E(0.71), whereas the hexaploid T. zhukovskyi exhibited polymorphism with electromorphs characteristic of T. timopheevii and T. monococcum. Wild tetraploid wheats, T. dicoccoides and T. araraticum, showed partially homologous intraspecific variation of AADH-E with heterozygous triplets E(0.58)/E(0.64) (the commonest), E(0.58)/E(0.71), E(0.45)/E(0.58), E(0.48)/E(0.58) and E(0.56)/E(0.58) recorded.

"15159634","abstracttext","Two overlapping bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones from the B genome of the tetraploid wheat Triticum turgidum were identified, each of which contains one of the two high-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenin genes, comprising the complex Glu-B1 locus. The complete sequence (285 506 bp of DNA) of this chromosomal region was determined. The two paralogous x-type ( Glu-1-1 ) and y-type ( Glu-1-2 ) HMW-glutenin genes of the complex Glu-B1 locus were found to be separated by ca. 168 000 bp instead of the 51 000 bp separation previously reported for the orthologous Glu-D1 locus of Aegilops tauschii, the D-genome donor of hexaploid wheat. This difference in intergene spacing is due almost entirely to be the insertion of clusters of nested retrotransposons. Otherwise, the orientation and order of the HMW glutenins and adjacent genes were identical in the two genomes. A comparison of these orthologous regions indicates modes and patterns of sequence divergence, with implications for the overall Triticeae genome structure and evolution. A duplicate globulin gene, found 5' of each HMW-glutenin gene, assists to tentatively define the original duplication event leading to the paralogous x- and y-type HMW-glutenin genes. The intergenic regions of the two loci are composed of different patterns and classes of retrotransposons, indicating that insertion times of these retroelements were after the divergence of the two wheat genomes. In addition, a putative receptor kinase gene near the y-type HMW-glutenin gene at the Glu-B1 locus is likely active as it matches recently reported ESTs from germinating barley endosperm. The presence of four genes represented only in the Triticeae endosperm ESTs suggests an endosperm-specific chromosome domain."
"16362370","articletitle","A cluster of 11 CBF transcription factors is located at the frost tolerance locus Fr-Am2 in Triticum monococcum."
"16362370","abstracttext","Due to the adverse effects of cold temperatures on winter wheat, frost tolerance is an important trait for breeding programs in regions with severe winters. Frost tolerance locus Fr-A(m)2 was recently discovered in diploid wheat (Triticum monococcum L.). This locus was mapped as a QTL on chromosome 5A(m) in the same region as a QTL for the level of transcription of the cold-regulated gene COR14b at 15 degrees C. A CBF transcription factor was mapped in the center of these two overlapping QTLs. However, since the CBF gene family in wheat has numerous members, it was possible that multiple CBF genes were present at Fr-A(m)2. To investigate this possibility we initiated a systematic characterization of the CBF family in T. monococcum. Here we report the molecular characterization of thirteen TmCBF genes. Nine of them were numbered according to the closest barley HvCBF gene, and the other four that have no clear barley orthologues were assigned numbers TmCBF15 to TmCBF18. TmCBF5 and TmCBF18 were mapped on T. monococcum chromosomes 7A(m) and 6A(m), respectively, and are thus not candidates for the Fr-A(m)2 gene. The remaining eleven TmCBF genes are clustered at the Fr-A(m)2 locus within five different Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clones. These BACs were mapped using a high-density map and recombination events were found between most BACs. Lines carrying these recombination events will be useful to identify which of the CBF genes is responsible for the differences in frost tolerance between the T. monococcum parental lines at the Fr-A(m)2 locus."
"24964065","articletitle","Avirulence effector discovery in a plant galling and plant parasitic arthropod, the Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor)."
"24964065","abstracttext","Highly specialized obligate plant-parasites exist within several groups of arthropods (insects and mites). Many of these are important pests, but the molecular basis of their parasitism and its evolution are poorly understood. One hypothesis is that plant parasitic arthropods use effector proteins to defeat basal plant immunity and modulate plant growth. Because avirulence (Avr) gene discovery is a reliable method of effector identification, we tested this hypothesis using high-resolution molecular genetic mapping of an Avr gene (vH13) in the Hessian fly (HF, Mayetiola destructor), an important gall midge pest of wheat (Triticum spp.). Chromosome walking resolved the position of vH13, and revealed alleles that determine whether HF larvae are virulent (survive) or avirulent (die) on wheat seedlings carrying the wheat H13 resistance gene. Association mapping found three independent insertions in vH13 that appear to be responsible for H13-virulence in field populations. We observed vH13 transcription in H13-avirulent larvae and the salivary glands of H13-avirulent larvae, but not in H13-virulent larvae. RNA-interference-knockdown of vH13 transcripts allowed some H13-avirulent larvae to escape H13-directed resistance. vH13 is the first Avr gene identified in an arthropod. It encodes a small modular protein with no sequence similarities to other proteins in GenBank. These data clearly support the hypothesis that an effector-based strategy has evolved in multiple lineages of plant parasites, including arthropods."

"26915753","abstracttext","The nuclear-encoded species cytoplasm specific (scs) genes control nuclear-cytoplasmic compatibility in wheat (genus Triticum). Alloplasmic cells, which have nucleus and cytoplasm derived from different species, produce vigorous and vital organisms only when the correct version of scs is present in their nucleus. In this study, bulks of in vivo radiation hybrids segregating for the scs phenotype have been genotyped by sequencing with over 1.9 million markers. The high marker saturation obtained for a critical region of chromosome 1D allowed identification of 3318 reads that mapped in close proximity of the scs. A novel in silico approach was deployed to extend these short reads to sequences of up to 70 Kb in length and identify candidate open reading frames (ORFs). Markers were developed to anchor the short contigs containing ORFs to a radiation hybrid map of 650 individuals with resolution of 288 Kb. The region containing the scs locus was narrowed to a single Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) contig of Aegilops tauschii. Its sequencing and assembly by nano-mapping allowed rapid identification of a rhomboid gene as the only ORF existing within the refined scs locus. Resequencing of this gene from multiple germplasm sources identified a single nucleotide mutation, which gives rise to a functional amino acid change. Gene expression characterization revealed that an active copy of this rhomboid exists on all homoeologous chromosomes of wheat, and depending on the specific cytoplasm each copy is preferentially expressed. Therefore, a new methodology was applied to unique genetic stocks to rapidly identify a strong candidate gene for the control of nuclear-cytoplasmic compatibility in wheat."

We have found that allelic isozyme markers and ecological factors provide an important predictive method for identifying elite genotypes characterized by single or multiple disease resistances, high protein content, and a variety of quantitative traits of agronomic importance including germination, earliness, biomass, and yield variables. Our predictive methodology could be improved by additional crossing tests in an attempt to verify the results derived from the correlation analysis and thus establish the linkage relationships between the marker gene and the quantitative trait under discussion. This methodology, if further developed by additional isozyme and DNA markers, verified by crossing tests and gene mapping, could substantially contribute to the sampling and utilization of the genetic resources of wild gene pools for crop improvement."

"22667446","abstracttext","Barley cultivars show various patterns of resistance against isolates of Magnaporthe oryzae and M. grisea. Genetic mechanisms of the resistance of five representative barley cultivars were examined using a highly susceptible barley cultivar, 'Nigrate', as a common parent of genetic crosses. The resistance of the five cultivars against Setaria, Oryza, Eleusine, and Triticum isolates of M. oryzae was all attributed to a single locus, designated as Rmo2. Nevertheless, the Rmo2 locus in each cultivar was effective against a different range of isolates. Genetic analyses of pathogenicity suggested that each cultivar carries an allele at the Rmo2 locus that recognizes a different range of avirulence genes. One allele, Rmo2.a, corresponded to PWT1, which conditioned the avirulence of Setaria and Oryza isolates on wheat, in a gene-for-gene manner. The other alleles, Rmo2.b, Rmo2.c, and Rmo2.d, corresponded to more than one avirulence gene. On the other hand, the resistance of those cultivars to another species, M. grisea, was conditioned by another locus, designated as Rmo3. These results suggest that Rmo2 is effective against a broad range of blast isolates but is specific to M. oryzae. Molecular mapping revealed that Rmo2 is located on the 7H chromosome."

All five LMW-GS genes possessed the same primary structure shared by other published LMW-GSs. The three genes emmer-1, emmer-3, and emmer-5 are similar, with the exception that emmer-3 and emmer-5 lost a few repeat motifs compared to emmer-1. Gene duplication and insertions/deletions of repeat motifs mediated through unequal crossing over may be responsible for the generation of these three Glu-3 alleles. Although the first residue of mature peptide of emmer-4 is isoleucine, it is not typical LMW-i-type LMW-GS. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that emmer-4 is located in the LMW-m subgroup, suggesting a closer relationship with LMW-m-type gene Y14104 of T. durum. Sequence alignment indicated that the emmer-4 is likely a chimeric gene generated by illegitimate recombination between LMW-i and LMW-m type. Unequal crossing over and illegitimate recombination are effective mechanisms for enriching both copy numbers and variations of LMW-GSs."

The mature protein coding sequences of WDAI genes were analyzed. Nucleotide sequence variations in these regions resulted from base substitution and/or indel mutations. Most of the WDAI gene sequences from T. boeoticum and all sequences from T. monococcum had one nucleotide insertion in the coding region, such that these alpha-amylase inhibitor sequences could not encode the correct mature proteins. We identified 21 distinct haplotypes from the diploid wheat WDAI gene sequences. A main haplotype was found in 15 gene samples from the A(u) genome and 35 gene samples from the A(m) genome. The T. monococcum and T. boeoticum accessions shared the same main haplotype, with 25 samples from T. monococcum and 10 from T. boeoticum. The WDAI gene sequences from the A(u) and A(m) genomes could be obviously clustered into two clades, but the sequences from the A(m) genome of T. boeoticum and T. monococcum could not be clearly distinguished. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the WDAI gene sequences from the A(m) genome had accumulated fewer variations and evolved at a slower rate than the sequences from the A(u) genome. Although some accessions from only one or two areas had unique mutations at the same position, the diversity of WDAI gene sequences in diploid wheat showed little relationship to the origin of the accessions."

"18059540","abstracttext","A novel y-type high molecular weight (HMW) glutenin subunit gene from the G genome of Triticum timopheevi (2n=4x=28, AAGG) was isolated and characterized. Genomic DNA from accession CWI17006 was amplified and a 2200 bp fragment was obtained. Sequence analysis revealed a complete open reading frame including N- and C-terminal ends and a central repetitive domain encoding 565 amino acid residues. The molecular weight of the deduced subunit was 77,031, close to that of the x-type glutenin subunits. Its mature protein structure, however, demonstrated that it was a typical y-type HMW subunit. To our knowledge, this is the largest y-type subunit gene among Triticum genomes. The molecular structure and phylogenetic analysis assigned it to the G genome and it is the first characterized y-type HMW glutenin subunit gene from T. timopheevi. Comparative analysis and secondary structure prediction showed that the subunit possessed some unique characters, especially 2 large insertions of 45 (6 hexapeptides and a nonapeptide) and 12 (2 hexapeptides) amino acid residues that mainly contributed to its higher molecular weight and allowed more coils to be formed in its tertiary structure. Additionally, more alpha-helixes in the repeat domain of the subunit were found when compared with 3 other y-type subunits. We speculate that these structural characteristics improve the formation of gluten polymer. The novel subunit, expressed as a fusion protein in E. coli, moved more slowly in SDS-PAGE than the subunit Bx7, so it was designated Gy7*. As indicated in previous studies, increased size and more numerous coils and alpha-helixes of the repetitive domain might enhance the functional properties of HMW glutenins. Consequently, the novel Gy7* gene could have greater potential for improving wheat quality."

"21733624","abstracttext","A laccase-producing white-rot fungi strain Ganoderma sp.En3 was newly isolated from the forest of Tzu-chin Mountain in China. Ganoderma sp.En3 had a strong ability of decolorizing four synthetic dyes, two simulated dye bath effluents and the real textile dye effluent. Induction in the activity of laccase during the decolorization process indicated that laccase played an important role in the efficient decolorization of different dyes by this fungus. Phytotoxicity study with respect to Triticum aestivum and Oryza sativa demonstrated that Ganoderma sp.En3 was able to detoxify four synthetic dyes, two simulated dye effluents and the real textile dye effluent. The laccase gene lac-En3-1 and its corresponding full-length cDNA were then cloned and characterized from Ganoderma sp.En3. The deduced protein sequence of LAC-En3-1 contained four copper-binding conserved domains of typical laccase protein. The functionality of lac-En3-1 gene encoding active laccase was verified by expressing this gene in the yeast Pichia pastoris successfully. The recombinant laccase produced by the yeast transformant could decolorize the synthetic dyes, simulated dye effluents and the real textile dye effluent. The ability of decolorizing different dyes was positively related to the laccase activity. In addition, the 5'-flanking sequence upstream of the start codon ATG in lac-En3-1 gene was obtained. Many putative cis-acting responsive elements were predicted in the promoter region of lac-En3-1."

The system was created with a Triticum aestivum promoter containing ABA responsive elements (ABREs) and a Sorghum bicolor NCED to cause ABA-stimulated ABA biosynthesis and signaling, through a positive feedback mechanism. The chimeric gene pABRE:NCED enhanced NCED and ABF (ABRE-binding factor) expression in Arabidopsis Columbia-0 seeds, which caused 9- to 73-fold increases in ABA levels. The pABRE:NCED seeds exhibited unusually deep dormancy which lasted for more than 3 months. Interestingly, the amplified ABA pathways also caused enhanced expression of Arabidopsis NCED5, revealing the presence of positive feedback in the native system. These results demonstrated the robustness of positive feedback mechanisms and the significance of NCED expression, or single metabolic change, during seed maturation. The pABRE:NCED system provides an excellent experimental system producing dormant and non-dormant seeds of the same maternal origin, which differ only in zygotic ABA. The pABRE:NCED seeds contain a GFP marker which enables seed sorting between transgenic and null segregants and are ideal for comparative analysis. In addition to its utility in basic research, the system can also be applied to prevention of pre-harvest sprouting during crop production, and therefore contributes to translational biology."

"25003197","abstracttext","Heat stress is a detrimental abiotic stress limiting the growth of many plant species and is associated with various cellular and physiological damages. Expansins are a family of proteins which are known to play roles in regulating cell wall elongation and expansion, as well as other growth and developmental processes. The in vitro roles of expansins regulating plant heat tolerance are not well understood. The objectives of this study were to isolate and clone an expansin gene in a perennial grass species (Poa pratensis) and to determine whether over-expression of expansin may improve plant heat tolerance. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) was used as the model plant for gene transformation and an expansin gene PpEXP1 from Poa pratensis was cloned. Sequence analysis showed PpEXP1 belonged to α-expansins and was closely related to two expansin genes in other perennial grass species (Festuca pratensis and Agrostis stolonifera) as well as Triticum aestivum, Oryza sativa, and Brachypodium distachyon. Transgenic tobacco plants over-expressing PpEXP1 were generated through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Under heat stress (42°C) in growth chambers, transgenic tobacco plants over-expressing the PpEXP1 gene exhibited a less structural damage to cells, lower electrolyte leakage, lower levels of membrane lipid peroxidation, and lower content of hydrogen peroxide, as well as higher chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate, relative water content, activity of antioxidant enzyme, and seed germination rates, compared to the wild-type plants. These results demonstrated the positive roles of PpEXP1 in enhancing plant tolerance to heat stress and the possibility of using expansins for genetic modification of cool-season perennial grasses in the development of heat-tolerant germplasm and cultivars."

"25900437","abstracttext","Low temperature as one of the most important environmental factors limits the productivity of plants across the world. Aegilops, as a wild species of Poaceae, contains low temperature-responsive genes. In this study, we analyzed morphological (wilting, chlorosis, and recovery) and physiological (ion leakage) characteristics to identification of a cold-tolerant genotype. In this experiment, we introduced two transcription factors (TFs) in Aegilops species for the first time. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that our nucleotide sequences have high similarity with CBF14 (C-repeat-binding factor) and NAC2 (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) in Triticum aestivum. Based on the physiological and morphological data, one genotype (Aladizgeh) was identified as the most resistant genotype which was selected for further gene expression analysis. The real-time PCR results indicated that the CBF14 gene was not expressed 3 h following cold treatment, but the highest expression was observed after 6, 12, and 24 h of cold treatment; however, a sudden decrease was observed in its expression after 30 h. The NAC2 gene also was not expressed 3 h after cold stress, but the highest expression was at 24 h and similar to the CBF14 gene; its expression suddenly decreased after 30 h. Our results indicated that this genotype can tolerate -4 °C for 3 h, but the CBF14 and NAC2 genes were activated when treated for longer durations. Expression of TFs studied in this experiment had decreased after 30 h, in which cell death seems to be the important reason."
"22292455","articletitle","Transcriptional programs regulating seed dormancy and its release by after-ripening in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)."
"22292455","abstracttext","Seed dormancy is an important agronomic trait in wheat (Trticum aestivum). Seeds can be released from a physiologically dormant state by after-ripening. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of after-ripening in conferring developmental switches from dormancy to germination in wheat seeds, we performed comparative transcriptomic analyses between dormant (D) and after-ripened (AR) seeds in both dry and imbibed states. Transcriptional activation of genes represented by a core of 22 and 435 probesets was evident in the dry and imbibed states of D seeds, respectively. Furthermore, two-way ANOVA analysis identified 36 probesets as specifically regulated by dormancy. These data suggest that biological functions associated with these genes are involved in the maintenance of seed dormancy. Expression of genes encoding protein synthesis/activity inhibitors was significantly repressed during after-ripening, leading to dormancy decay. Imbibing AR seeds led to transcriptional activation of distinct biological processes, including those related to DNA replication, nitrogen metabolism, cytoplasmic membrane-bound vesicle, jasmonate biosynthesis and cell wall modification. These after-ripening-mediated transcriptional programs appear to be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Clustering of our microarray data produced 16 gene clusters; dormancy-specific probesets and abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive elements were significantly overrepresented in two clusters, indicating the linkage of dormancy in wheat with that of seed sensitivity to ABA. The role of ABA signalling in regulating wheat seed dormancy was further supported by the down-regulation of ABA response-related probesets in AR seeds and absence of differential expression of ABA metabolic genes between D and AR seeds."

"27322749","abstracttext","Brassinosteroids (BRs) hormones are important for plant growth, development and immune responses. They are sensed by the transmembrane receptor kinase Brassinosteroid-Insensitive 1 (BRI1) when they bind to its extracellular Leu-rich repeat (LRR) domain. We cloned and characterized the TaBRI1 from T. aestivum and raised overexpression transgenics in Arabidopsis to decipher its functional role. TaBRI1 protein consists of a putative signal peptide followed by 25 leucine rich repeats (LRR), a transmembrane domain and a C-terminal kinase domain. The analysis determined the interaction of TaBRI1 with five members of the wheat Somatic Embryogenesis Receptor Kinase (TaSERKs) gene family (TaSERK1, TaSERK2, TaSERK3, TaSERK4 and TaSERK5), at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, overexpression of TaBRI1 in Arabidopsis leads to the early flowering, increased silique size and seed yield. Root growth analysis of TaBRI1 overexpressing transgenic plants showed hypersensitivity to epi-brassinolide (epi-BL) hormone in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, transgenic Arabidopsis plants show thermotolerance phenotype at the seedling stages as revealed by chlorophyll content, photosystem II activity and membrane stability. The transcriptome profiling on the basis of microarray analysis indicates up-regulation of several genes related to brassinosteroid signaling pathway, abiotic stress response, defense response and transcription factors. These studies predict the possible role of TaBRI1 gene in plant growth and development imparting tolerance to thermal stress."
"15988564","articletitle","Specific patterns of changes in wheat gene expression after treatment with three antifungal compounds."
"15988564","abstracttext","The two fungicides azoxystrobin and fenpropimorph are used against powdery mildew and rust diseases in wheat (Triticum aestivumL). Azoxystrobin, a strobilurin, inhibits fungal mitochondrial respiration and fenpropimorph, a morpholin, represses biosynthesis of ergosterol, the major sterol of fungal membranes. Although the fungitoxic activity of these compounds is well understood, their effects on plant metabolism remain unclear. In contrast to the fungicides which directly affect pathogen metabolism, benzo(1,2,3) thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methylester (BTH) induces resistance against wheat pathogens by the activation of systemic acquired resistance in the host plant. In this study, we monitored gene expression in spring wheat after treatment with each of these agrochemicals in a greenhouse trial using a microarray containing 600 barley cDNA clones. Defence-related genes were strongly induced after treatment with BTH, confirming the activation of a similar set of genes as in dicot plants following salicylic acid treatment. A similar gene expression pattern was observed after treatment with fenpropimorph and some defence-related genes were induced by azoxystrobin, demonstrating that these fungicides also activate a defence reaction. However, less intense responses were triggered than with BTH. The same experiments performed under field conditions gave dramatically different results. No gene showed differential expression after treatment and defence genes were already expressed at a high level before application of the agrochemicals. These differences in the expression patterns between the two environments demonstrate the importance of plant growth conditions for testing the impact of agrochemicals on plant metabolism."

"17131106","abstracttext","The yellow colour of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var durum) semolina is due in part to the presence of carotenoid pigments found in the endosperm and is an important end-use quality trait. We hypothesized that variation in the genes coding for phytoene synthase (Psy), a critical enzyme in carotenoid biosynthesis, may partially explain the phenotypic variation in endosperm colour observed among durum cultivars. Using rice sequence information, primers were designed to PCR clone and sequence the Psy genes from Kofa (high colour) and W9262-260D3 (medium colour) durum cultivars. Sequencing confirmed the presence of four Psy genes in each parent, corresponding to a two member gene family designated as Psy1-1, Psy1-2 and Psy2-1 and Psy2-2. A genetic map was constructed using 155 F1-derived doubled haploid lines from the cross W9262-260D3/Kofa with 194 simple sequence repeat and DArT markers. Using Psy1-1 and Psy2-1 allele-specific markers and chromosome mapping, the Psy1 and Psy2 genes were located to the group 7 and 5 chromosomes, respectively. Four quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying phenotypic variation in endosperm colour were identified on chromosomes 2A, 4B, 6B, and 7B. The Psy1-1 locus co-segregated with the 7B QTL, demonstrating an association of this gene with phenotypic variation for endosperm colour. This work is the first report of mapping Psy genes and supports the role of Psy1-1 in elevated levels of endosperm colour in durum wheat. This gene is a target for the further development of a molecular marker to enhance selection for endosperm colour in durum wheat breeding programs."

"20101489","abstracttext","In Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus parasiticus, lipoperoxidative signalling is crucial for the regulation of mycotoxin biosynthesis, conidiogenesis, and sclerotia formation. Resveratrol, which is a lipoxygenase (LOX) and cyclooxygenase inhibitor, downmodulates the biosynthesis of ochratoxin A (OTA) in Aspergillus ochraceus. In the genome of A. ochraceus, a lox-like sequence (AoloxA; National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) accession number: DQ087531) for a lipoxygenase-like enzyme has been found, which presents high homology (100 identities, 100 positives %, score 555) with a lox gene of Aspergillus fumigatus (NCBI accession number: XM741370). To study how inhibition of oxylipins formation may affect the A. ochraceus metabolism, we have used a DeltaAoloxA strain. This mutant displays a different colony morphology, a delayed conidia formation, and a high sclerotia production. When compared to the wild type, the DeltaAoloxA strain showed a lower basal activity of LOX and diminished levels of 13-hydroperoxylinoleic acid (HPODE) and other oxylipins derived from linoleic acid. The limited oxylipins formation corresponded to a remarkable inhibition of OTA biosynthesis in the DeltaAoloxA strain. Also, wheat seeds (Triticum durum cv Ciccio) inoculated with the DeltaAoloxA mutant did not accumulate 9-HPODE, which is a crucial element in the host defence system. Similarly, the expression of the pathogenesis-related protein 1 (PR1) gene in wheat seeds was not enhanced. The results obtained contribute to the current knowledge on the role of lipid peroxidation governed by the AoloxA gene in the morphogenesis, OTA biosynthesis, and in host-pathogen interaction between wheat seeds and A. ochraceus."

"21915709","abstracttext","Allotetraploid (2n = 4x = 28) Leymus triticoides and Leymus cinereus are divergent perennial grasses, which form fertile hybrids. Genetic maps with n = 14 linkage groups (LG) comprised with 1,583 AFLP and 67 heterologous anchor markers were previously used for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in these hybrids, and chromosomes of other Leymus wildryes have been transferred to wheat. However, identifications of the x = 7 homoeologous groups were tenuous and genetic research has been encumbered by a lack of functional, conserved gene marker sequences. Herein, we mapped 350 simple sequence repeats and 26 putative lignin biosynthesis genes from a new Leymus EST library and constructed one integrated consensus map with 799 markers, including 375 AFLPs and 48 heterologous markers, spanning 2,381 centiMorgans. LG1b and LG6b were reassigned as LG6b* and LG1b*, respectively, and LG4Ns and LG4Xm were inverted so that all 14 linkage groups are aligned to the x = 7 Triticeae chromosomes based on EST alignments to barley and other reference genomes. Amplification of 146 mapped Leymus ESTs representing six of the seven homoeologous groups was shown for 17 wheat-Leymus chromosome introgression lines. Reciprocal translocations between 4L and 5L in both Leymus and Triticum monococcum were aligned to the same regions of Brachypodium chromosome 1. A caffeic acid O-methyltransferase locus aligned to fiber QTL peaks on Leymus LG7a and brown midrib mutations of maize and sorghum. Glaucousness genes on Leymus and wheat chromosome 2 were aligned to the same region of Brachypodium chromosome 5. Markers linked to the S self-incompatibility gene on Leymus LG1a cosegregated with markers on LG2b, possibly cross-linked by gametophytic selection. Homoeologous chromosomes 1 and 2 harbor the S and Z gametophytic self-incompatibility genes of Phalaris, Secale, and Lolium, but the Leymus chromosome-2 self-incompatibility gene aligns to a different region on Brachypodium chromosome 5. Nevertheless, cosegregation of self-incompatibility genes on Leymus presents a powerful system for mapping these loci."

"21110856","abstracttext_background","The yellow colour of pasta products is one of the main criteria used by consumers to assess pasta quality. This character is due to the presence of carotenoid pigments in semolina. During pasta processing, oxidative degradation of carotenoid pigments occurs mainly due to lipoxygenase (LOX). In durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.), two Lpx-1 genes have been identified on chromosome 4B, Lpx-B1.1 and Lpx-B1.2, and evidences have been reported that the deletion of Lpx-B1.1 is associated with a strong reduction in LOX activity in semolina. In the present study, we characterised the Lpx-B1 gene family identified in a durum wheat germplasm collection and related the distribution and expression of the Lpx-B1 genes and alleles to variations in LOX activity in the mature grains."
"21110856","abstracttext_results","In addition to the already known Lpx-B1.1 and Lpx-B1.2 genes, a new gene was identified, Lpx-B1.3, along with three different Lpx-B1.1 alleles, Lpx-B1.1a, Lpx-B1.1b and the partially deleted Lpx-B1.1c. Screening of the germplasm collection showed that all of the genotypes have one of the three Lpx-B1.1 alleles, associated with either Lpx-B1.2 or Lpx-B1.3, thus showing that in this collection the two genes are alternatives. Therefore, based on Lpx-B1 distribution, three different haplotypes were distinguished: haplotype I, carrying Lpx-B1.3 and the Lpx-B1.1b allele; haplotype II carrying Lpx-B1.2 and the Lpx-B1.1a allele; and haplotype III carrying Lpx-B1.2 and the Lpx-B1.1c allele. Determination of Lpx-B1 transcript abundance and total LOX activity in mature grains revealed differences among these three haplotypes: haplotypes I, II and III showed high, intermediate and low levels, respectively, of functional Lpx-B1 transcripts and enzymatic activity."
"21110856","abstracttext_conclusions","In this germplasm collection, the Lpx-B1 gene family accounts for most of the total LOX activity in the mature grains. Information on these Lpx-B1 haplotypes provides significant improvement for prediction of LOX-1 activity levels in mature grains, and will therefore help in breeding programmes aimed at selection of new durum wheat genotypes with higher carotenoid contents in their end products."

"20859611","abstracttext_introduction","Recombination is a key evolutionary factor enhancing diversity. However, the effect of recombination on diversity in inbreeding species is expected to be low. To estimate this effect, recombination and diversity patterns of Lr10 gene were studied in natural populations of the inbreeder species, wild emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccoides). Wild emmer wheat is the progenitor of most cultivated wheats and it harbors rich genetic resources for disease resistance. Lr10 is a leaf rust resistance gene encoding three domains: a coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding site, and leucine-rich repeat (CC-NBS-LRR)."
"20859611","abstracttext_results","Lr10 was sequenced from 58 accessions representing 12 diverse habitats in Israel. Diversity analysis revealed a high rate of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions (d (S) = 0.029, d (N) = 0.018, respectively) in the NBS-LRR domains. Moreover, in contrast to other resistance genes, in Lr10 the CC domain was more diverse than the NBS-LRR domains (d (S) = 0.069 vs. 0.029, d (N) = 0.094 vs. 0.018) and was subjected to positive selection in some of the populations. Seventeen recombination events were detected between haplotypes, especially in the CC domain. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis has shown a rapid decay from r (2) = 0.5 to r (2) = 0.1 within a 2-kb span."
"20859611","abstracttext_conclusion","These results suggest that recombination is a diversifying force for the R-gene, Lr10, in the selfing species T. dicoccoides. This is the first report of a short-range LD decay in wild emmer wheat."

"25660540","abstracttext","Gall-forming arthropods are highly specialized herbivores that, in combination with their hosts, produce extended phenotypes with unique morphologies [1]. Many are economically important, and others have improved our understanding of ecology and adaptive radiation [2]. However, the mechanisms that these arthropods use to induce plant galls are poorly understood. We sequenced the genome of the Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor; Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), a plant parasitic gall midge and a pest of wheat (Triticum spp.), with the aim of identifying genic modifications that contribute to its plant-parasitic lifestyle. Among several adaptive modifications, we discovered an expansive reservoir of potential effector proteins. Nearly 5% of the 20,163 predicted gene models matched putative effector gene transcripts present in the M. destructor larval salivary gland. Another 466 putative effectors were discovered among the genes that have no sequence similarities in other organisms. The largest known arthropod gene family (family SSGP-71) was also discovered within the effector reservoir. SSGP-71 proteins lack sequence homologies to other proteins, but their structures resemble both ubiquitin E3 ligases in plants and E3-ligase-mimicking effectors in plant pathogenic bacteria. SSGP-71 proteins and wheat Skp proteins interact in vivo. Mutations in different SSGP-71 genes avoid the effector-triggered immunity that is directed by the wheat resistance genes H6 and H9. Results point to effectors as the agents responsible for arthropod-induced plant gall formation."

"28321518","abstracttext","MicroRNAs are a class of post-transcriptional regulators of plant developmental and physiological processes and responses to environmental stresses. Here, we present the study regarding the annotation and characterization of MIR genes conducted in durum wheat. We characterized the miRNAome of leaf and root tissues at tillering stage under two environmental conditions: irrigated with 100% (control) and 55% of evapotranspiration (early water stress). In total, 90 microRNAs were identified, of which 32 were classified as putative novel and species-specific miRNAs. In addition, seven microRNA homeologous groups were identified in each of the two genomes of the tetraploid durum wheat. Differential expression analysis highlighted a total of 45 microRNAs significantly differentially regulated in the pairwise comparisons leaf versus root. The miRNA families, miR530, miR395, miR393, miR5168, miR396 and miR166, miR171, miR319, and miR167, were the most expressed in leaves in comparison to roots. Putative microRNA targets were predicted for both five and three prime sequences derived from the stem-loop of the MIR gene. Gene ontology analysis showed significant overrepresented gene categories in microRNA targets belonging to transcription factors, phenylpropanoids, oxydases, and lipid binding-protein. This work represents one of the first genome wide characterization of MIR genes in durum wheat, identifying leaf and root tissue-specific microRNAs. This genomic identification of microRNAs together with the analysis of their expression profiles is a well-accepted starting point leading to a better comprehension of the role of MIR genes in the genus Triticum."

"11430483","abstracttext","Two stripe-rust resistance genes, YrH52 and Yr15, derived from the Israeli wild emmer wheat, Triticum dicoccoides, have been located on chromosome 1B. The main objectives of the present study were to increase marker density in the vicinity of YrH52 gene by means of AFLP, RAPD and microsatellite markers, to improve the map of another T dicoccoides-derived stripe-rust resistance gene Yr15 using microsatellite markers, and to preliminarily discriminate these two genes. Additional 26 marker loci comprising 20 AFLPs, three RAPDs, and three microsatellites were found to be linked to YrH52 gene. An updated genetic map consisting of 45 marker loci, in the region of YrH52 gene, was constructed with a total map length of 107.7 cm. The mean interval length was 0.96 cm in the region Xgwm359b-P55M53b carrying YrH52 gene. YrH52 was bracketed by Xgwm413 (Nor1 and UBC212a) and Xgwm273a (Xgwm273d) with map distance of 1.3 and 2.7 cm from either side, respectively. Eight additional microsatellite markers were found to be linked with Yr15, and the linkage map of Yr15 gene was thus obviously improved. In the YrH52-mapping population, no crossover was detected in the interval UBC212a (Xgwm413)-Yr15-Nor1, and YrH52 was located distally outside this interval. It may suggest that YrH52 is different from Yr15 even though both of them are derived from T. dicoccoides and are mapped on chromosome 1BS. The large number of molecular makers revealed in the present study would be helpful for the marker-assisted introgression of the T. dicoccoides-derived YrH52 and Yr15 stripe-rust resistance genes into elite cultivars of wheat, and the high-density map would accelerate the map-based cloning of the two genes."

"16208504","abstracttext","Several new races of the stripe rust pathogen have become frequent throughout the wheat growing regions of the United States since 2000. These new races are virulent to most of the wheat seedling resistance genes limiting the resistance sources that can be used to combat this pathogen. High-temperature adult-plant (HTAP) stripe rust resistance has proven to be more durable than seedling resistance due to its non-race-specific nature, but its use is limited by the lack of mapping information. We report here the identification of a new HTAP resistance gene from Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides (DIC) designated as Yr36. Lines carrying this gene were susceptible to almost all the stripe rust pathogen races tested at the seedling stage but showed adult-plant resistance to the prevalent races in California when tested at high diurnal temperatures. Isogenic lines for this gene were developed by six backcross generations. Field tests in two locations showed increased levels of field resistance to stripe rust and increased yields in isogenic lines carrying the Yr36 gene compared to those without the gene. Recombinant substitution lines of chromosome 6B from DIC in the isogenic background of durum cv. Langdon were used to map the Yr36 gene on the short arm of chromosome 6B completely linked to Xbarc101, and within a 2-cM interval defined by PCR-based markers Xucw71 and Xbarc136. Flanking locus Xucw71 is also closely linked to the grain protein content locus Gpc-B1 (0.3-cM). Marker-assisted selection strategies are presented to improve stripe rust resistance and simultaneously select for high or low Gpc-B1 alleles."

MacKey] cultivar Langdon and wild emmer wheat [T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides (Körn.) Thell.] accession G18-16. One hundred and fifty-two single-seed descent derived F(6) recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were analyzed with a total of 690 loci, including 197 microsatellite and 493 DArT markers. Linkage analysis defined 14 linkage groups. Most markers were mapped to the B-genome (60%), with an average of 57 markers per chromosome and the remaining 40% mapped to the A-genome, with an average of 39 markers per chromosome. To construct a stabilized (skeleton) map, markers interfering with map stability were removed. The skeleton map consisted of 307 markers with a total length of 2,317 cM and average distance of 7.5 cM between adjacent markers. The length of individual chromosomes ranged between 112 cM for chromosome 4B to 217 cM for chromosome 3B. A fraction (30.1%) of the markers deviated significantly from the expected Mendelian ratios; clusters of loci showing distorted segregation were found on chromosomes 1A, 1BL, 2BS, 3B, and 4B. DArT markers showed high proportion of clustering, which may be indicative of gene-rich regions. Three hundred and fifty-two new DArT markers were mapped for the first time on the current map. This map provides a useful groundwork for further genetic analyses of important quantitative traits, positional cloning, and marker-assisted selection, as well as for genome comparative genomics and genome organization studies in wheat and other cereals."

"22926291","abstracttext","Breeding for resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB) in durum wheat continues to be hindered by the lack of effective resistance sources. Only limited information is available on resistance QTL for FHB in tetraploid wheat. In this study, resistance to FHB of a Triticum dicoccum line in the background of three Austrian T. durum cultivars was genetically characterized. Three populations of BC(1)F(4)-derived RILs were developed from crosses between the resistant donor line T. dicoccum-161 and the Austrian T. durum recipient varieties DS-131621, Floradur and Helidur. About 130 BC(1)F(4)-derived lines per population were evaluated for FHB response using artificial spray inoculation in four field experiments during two seasons. Lines were genetically fingerprinted using SSR and AFLP markers. Genomic regions on chromosomes 3B, 4B, 6A, 6B and 7B were significantly associated with FHB severity. FHB resistance QTL on 6B and 7B were identified in two populations and a resistance QTL on 4B appeared in three populations. The alleles that enhanced FHB resistance were derived from the T. dicoccum parent, except for the QTL on chromosome 3B. All QTL except the QTL on 6A mapped to genomic regions where QTL for FHB have previously been reported in hexaploid wheat. QTL on 3B and 6B coincided with Fhb1 and Fhb2, respectively. This implies that tetraploid and hexaploid wheat share common genomic regions associated with FHB resistance. QTL for FHB resistance on 4B co-located with a major QTL for plant height and mapped at the position of the Rht-B1 gene, while QTL on 7B overlapped with QTL for flowering time."

"24247934","abstracttext","The relative proportion and amount of proteins in five defined molecular weight (MW) regions (A1=above 71,000=71K, A2=71K-49K, A3=49K-31K, A4=31K-20K, A5=20K and less) were estimated by densitometric analyses of the amount of dye bound by kernel proteins (Fullington et al. 1980) of Triticum dicoccoides SDS-PAGE gels. These MW regions roughly correspond to the wheat protein solubility classes (Cole et al. 1981; Fullington et al. 1983). One purpose of the study was to select accessions whose seed proteins bind relatively high amounts of dye in the glutenin and albumin globulin regions. These accessions will be used for further in-depth studies as possible candidate donors of genes to improve the baking and nutritional quality of wheat. Marked differences in the quantitative relationships were found among the proteins in the five MW regions. Coefficients of variation (CV's) for the highest peak (i.e., most abundant protein) MW in different protein MW regions were similar for A1, A2 and A3, at 11.4, 11.7, and 11.1%, respectively, but only 4.1 for A4, and 10.6% for region A5. The CV for the highest peak MW overall was 29.8. Accession BP0649, for example, had over 44% of its protein in region A5, whereas BP0566 (lowest among the top 10%) had only 21.4% of its protein in that region. Over 37% of the proteins of accessions BP0649 and 0001 to 0005 was in region A5. At least 84 accessions with the highest amount of protein in region A5, and 13 accessions with more protein in region A1 than Chinese Spring may merit further evaluation as possible protein gene donors. High amounts of protein in A1 may be of importance in bread-baking quality, and in A4 and A5 for high lysine wheat. Accessions in both extremes were selected to test these hypotheses. All accessions are now or will be available in the USDA Wheat Collection."
"26562166","articletitle","Genome-Wide Identification of MicroRNAs in Leaves and the Developing Head of Four Durum Genotypes during Water Deficit Stress."
"26562166","abstracttext","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play critical roles in plant development and abiotic stress responses. The miRNA transcriptome (miRNAome) under water deficit stress has been investigated in many plant species, but is poorly characterised in durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum). Water stress during early reproductive stages can result in significant yield loss in durum wheat and this study describes genotypic differences in the miRNAome between water deficit tolerant and sensitive durum genotypes. Small RNA libraries (96 in total) were constructed from flag leaf and developing head tissues of four durum genotypes, with or without water stress to identify differentially abundant miRNAs. Illumina sequencing detected 110 conserved miRNAs and 159 novel candidate miRNA hairpins with 66 conserved miRNAs and five novel miRNA hairpins differentially abundant under water deficit stress. Ten miRNAs (seven conserved, three novel) were validated through qPCR. Several conserved and novel miRNAs showed unambiguous inverted regulatory profiles between the durum genotypes. Several miRNAs also showed differential abundance between two tissue types regardless of treatment. Predicted mRNA targets (130) of four novel durum miRNAs were characterised using Gene Ontology (GO) which revealed functions common to stress responses and plant development. Negative correlation was observed between several target genes and the corresponding miRNA under water stress. For the first time, we present a comprehensive study of the durum miRNAome under water deficit stress. The identification of differentially abundant miRNAs provides molecular evidence that miRNAs are potential determinants of water stress tolerance in durum wheat. GO analysis of predicted targets contributes to the understanding of genotypic physiological responses leading to stress tolerance capacity. Further functional analysis of specific stress responsive miRNAs and their interaction with targets is ongoing and will assist in developing future durum wheat varieties with enhanced water deficit stress tolerance."

"28668082","abstracttext_background","Wild diploid wheat, Triticum urartu (T. urartu) is the progenitor of bread wheat, and understanding its genetic diversity and genome function will provide considerable reference for dissecting genomic information of common wheat."
"28668082","abstracttext_results","In this study, we investigated the morphological and genetic diversity and population structure of 238 T. urartu accessions collected from different geographic regions. This collection had 19.37 alleles per SSR locus and its polymorphic information content (PIC) value was 0.76, and the PIC and Nei's gene diversity (GD) of high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GSs) were 0.86 and 0.88, respectively. UPGMA clustering analysis indicated that the 238 T. urartu accessions could be classified into two subpopulations, of which Cluster I contained accessions from Eastern Mediterranean coast and those from Mesopotamia and Transcaucasia belonged to Cluster II. The wide range of genetic diversity along with the manageable number of accessions makes it one of the best collections for mining valuable genes based on marker-trait association. Significant associations were observed between simple sequence repeats (SSR) or HMW-GSs and six morphological traits: heading date (HD), plant height (PH), spike length (SPL), spikelet number per spike (SPLN), tiller angle (TA) and grain length (GL)."
"28668082","abstracttext_conclusions","Our data demonstrated that SSRs and HMW-GSs were useful markers for identification of beneficial genes controlling important traits in T. urartu, and subsequently for their conservation and future utilization, which may be useful for genetic improvement of the cultivated hexaploid wheat."

"29606089","abstracttext_background","Spike architecture mutants in tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum L., 2n = 28, AABB) have a distinct morphology, with parts of the rachis node producing lateral meristems that develop into ramified spikelete (RSs) or four-rowed spikelete (FRSs). The genetic basis of RSs and FRSs has been analyzed, but little is known about the underlying developmental mechanisms of the lateral meristem. We used isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) to perform a quantitative proteomic analysis of immature spikes harvested from tetraploid near-isogenic lines of wheat with normal spikelete (NSs), FRSs, and RSs and investigated the molecular mechanisms of lateral meristem differentiation and development. This work provides valuable insight into the underlying functions of the lateral meristem and how it can produce differences in the branching of tetraploid wheat spikes."
"29606089","abstracttext_results","Using an iTRAQ-based shotgun quantitation approach, 104 differential abundance proteins (DAPs) with < 1% false discovery rate (FDR) and a 1.5-fold change (> 1.50 or < 0.67) were identified by comparing FRS with NS and RS with NS genotypes. To determine the functions of the proteins, 38 co-expressed DAPs from the two groups were annotated using the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analytical tools. We discovered that proteins involved in ""post-embryonic development"" and ""metabolic pathways"" such as carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism could be used to construct a developmentally associated network. Additionally, 6 out of 38 DAPs in the network were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the correlation coefficient between proteomics and qRT-PCR was 0.7005. These key genes and proteins were closely scrutinized and discussed."
"29606089","abstracttext_conclusions","Here, we predicted that DAPs involved in ""post-embryonic development"" and ""metabolic pathways"" may be responsible for the spikelete architecture changes in FRS and RS. Furthermore, we discussed the potential function of several vital DAPs from GO and KEGG analyses that were closely related to histone modification, ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, transcription factors, carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism and heat shock proteins (HSPs). This work provides valuable insight into the underlying functions of the lateral meristem in the branching of tetraploid wheat spikes."

"30238225","abstracttext","WRKY transcription factors (TFs) act in regulating plant growth and development as well as in response to different stress. Some earlier studies done by individual researchers reported different wheat WRKY TFs. Although, the recently released wheat genome has opened an avenue to investigate wheat WRKYs (TaWRKY) TFs. Prime objective of this study to performed genome-wide classifications of TaWRKYs and their functional annotation. The classification of 107 individual identified characterized sequences of TaWRKY (IICS-TaWRKY) and 160 uncharacterized draft sequences of TaWRKY (UDS-TaWRKY), along with their gene structures and motifs analysis was performed. Along with comparative sequence analysis and microarray analysis was performed to mimic out TaWRKYs functions in response to different abiotic stresses, accompanied by in-vitro validation. The comparative phylogenetic analysis and estimation of Ka/Ks ratio with Triticum urartu, illustrate group based clasifications of TaWRKYs and evolutionary divergences. Furthermore, motif-based and protein-DNA interaction analysis of TaWRKYs helps to identify, their putative function in target DNA recognition sites. Subsequently, results of microarray and comparative sequence analysis provides the evidence of TaWRKYs involved in heat and/or drought stress. Further, in-vitro results validates that TaWRKY014, TaWRKY090 are found to participate in response of drought stress, whereas TaWRKY008, TaWRKY122, and WRKY45 are involved in response of heat and drought stress. These findings can be utilized in developing novel heat and drought-tolerant wheat cultivars using marker-assisted breeding and transgenic development."
"31437174","articletitle","Spectral characterization of wheat functional trait responses to Hessian fly: Mechanisms for trait-based resistance."
"31437174","abstracttext","Insect herbivores can manipulate host plants to inhibit defenses. Insects that induce plant galls are excellent examples of these interactions. The Hessian fly (HF, Mayetiola destructor) is a destructive pest of wheat (Triticum spp.) that occurs in nearly all wheat producing globally. Under compatible interactions (i.e., successful HF establishment), HF larvae alter host tissue physiology and morphology for their benefit, manifesting as the development of plant nutritive tissue that feeds the larva and ceases plant cell division and elongation. Under incompatible interactions (i.e., unsuccessful HF establishment), plants respond to larval feeding by killing the larva, permitting normal plant development. We used reflectance spectroscopy to characterize whole-plant functional trait responses during both compatible and incompatible interactions and related these findings with morphological and gene expression observations from earlier studies. Spectral models successfully characterized wheat foliar traits, with mean goodness of fit statistics of 0.84, 0.85, 0.94, and 0.69 and percent root mean square errors of 22, 10, 6, and 20%, respectively, for nitrogen and carbon concentrations, leaf mass per area, and total phenolic content. We found that larvae capable of generating compatible interactions successfully manipulated host plant chemical and morphological composition to create a more hospitable environment. Incompatible interactions resulted in lower host plant nutritional quality, thicker leaves, and higher phenolic levels. Spectral measurements successfully characterized wheat responses to compatible and incompatible interactions, providing an excellent example of the utility of Spectral phenotyping in quantifying responses of specific plant functional traits associated with insect resistance."

"33225586","abstracttext","The LRK10-like receptor kinases (LRK10L-RLKs) are ubiquitously present in higher plants, but knowledge of their expression and function is still limited. Here, we report expression and functional analysis of TtdLRK10L-1, a typical LRK10L-RLK in durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum). The introns of TtdLRK10L-1 contained multiple kinds of predicted cis-elements. To investigate the potential effect of these cis-elements on TtdLRK10L-1 expression and function, two types of transgenic wheat lines were prepared, which expressed a GFP-tagged TtdLRK10L-1 protein (TtdLRK10L-1:GFP) from the cDNA or genomic DNA (gDNA) sequence of TtdLRK10L-1 under the native promoter. TtdLRK10L-1:GFP expression was up-regulated by the powdery mildew pathogen Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) in both types of transgenic plants, with the scale of the elevation being much stronger in the gDNA lines. Both types of transgenic plants exhibited enhanced resistance to Bgt infection relative to wild type control. Notably, the Bgt defence activated in the gDNA lines was significantly stronger than that in the cDNA lines. Further analysis revealed that a putative MYB transcription factor binding site (MYB-BS, CAGTTA) located in TtdLRK10L-1 intron I was critical for the efficient expression and function of TtdLRK10L-1 in Bgt defence. This MYB-BS could also increase the activity of a superpromoter widely used in ectopic gene expression studies in plants. Together, our results deepen the understanding of the expression and functional characteristics of LRK10L-RLKs. TtdLRK10L-1 is likely useful for further dissecting the molecular processes underlying wheat defence against Bgt and for developing Bgt resistant wheat crops."

"1633494","abstracttext","We have investigated the relationship between viral DNA replication and virion sense gene expression in wheat dwarf virus (WDV), a member of the geminivirus group, by testing a series of deletion mutants in transfected Triticum monococcum (einkorn) protoplasts. Mutants contained a transcription fusion of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase coding sequence to the virion sense promoter that replaced the viral coat protein coding sequence. The deletion analysis revealed that WDV replication and virion sense transcription can proceed independently and are controlled in part by nonoverlapping elements in the large intergenic region. These data and those from a C2 open reading frame (ORF) frameshift mutant also showed that the product of the C2 ORF (C1-C2 protein) is independently involved in both DNA replication and activation of the virion sense promoter. The amino acid sequences encoded by C2, which are highly conserved in the geminivirus group, show some homology to the DNA binding domain of the myb-related class of plant transcription factors. The possible involvement of the host in controlling the function of the C1-C2 protein and the implication of these data for the development of WDV-based gene vectors are discussed."

STS and SCAR markers were used to verify the presence of the resistance genes Lr37 and Lr10 against leaf rust in cultivars, near-isogenic lines and segregating populations. The Lr37 gene is present in a small translocation from Triticum ventricosum Ces. (Aegilops ventricosa Tausch) and is tightly linked with resistance genes Yr17 and Sr38. The Lr37 gene was identified in the cultivars Kris, Clever, Slade, Apache, Caphorn, Lorraine, Balthasar, Renan and confirmed by two PCR markers. The F3 progenies of the crosses Kris (Lr37) X Nutka (Lr37 not present) were used for map construction. Two STS/SCAR markers specific for Lr37 were mapped in relation to nine polymorphic microsatellites on chromosome 2AS. The microsatellite marker Xgwm1176 mapped relatively close to the STS and SCAR markers for Lr37 with a linkage distance of 4.1 cM."

The resulting hemizygous (lo) scs(ti)- durum line was male sterile and when crossed to normal durum produced a 1:1 ratio of plump, viable (PV) seeds with scs(ti) and shriveled inviable (SIV) seeds without scs(ti). In a systematic characterization of durum lines an unusual line was identified that when crossed to (lo) scs(ti)- produced all PV seeds. When planted these PV seeds segregated at a 1:1 ratio of normal vigor plants (NVPs) and low vigor plants (LVPs). The LVP senescence before full maturity. The NVPs were male sterile and when crossed to common durum lines resulted in all plump seeds that again segregated at a 1:1 ratio of NVPs to LVPs. The crosses of these NVPs to common durum lines resulted in a 1:1 ratio of PV to SIV seeds. This study was extended to 317 individuals segregating for scs(ti) and the new locus, derived from durum wheat (scs(d)), establishing the allelic relationship of these two genes."

One major 18S-26S rDNA locus was found in the nucleolus organizer region (NOR) of each of the species Aegilops tauschii and Aegilops uniaristata and two loci were detected in the remaining species. In addition to major NORs, from one to nine minor loci were observed; their numbers and chromosomal locations were species-specific. Some minor loci were polymorphic, whereas others were conserved. One or two 5S rDNA loci were observed in the short arms of the chromosomes of groups 1 and 5 of all diploid Aegilops species except Ae. uniaristata, where one 5S rDNA site was located in the distal part of the long arm of chromosome 1N. The 5S rDNA loci were not associated with NORs; however, the relative positions of two ribosomal RNA gene families were diagnostic for chromosomes of homoeologous groups 1, 5, and 6.

"20360019","abstracttext","High soil salinity is a major abiotic stress in plant agriculture worldwide. Here, we report the characterization of a novel aquaporin gene TaNIP (Triticum asetivum L. nodulin 26-like intrinsic protein), which was involved in salt tolerance pathways in plants. TaNIP was identified and cloned through the gene chip expression analysis of a salt-tolerant wheat mutant RH8706-49 under salt stress. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Q-RT-PCR) was used to detect TaNIP expression under salt, drought, cold and ABA treatment. The overexpression of TaNIP in transgenic Arabidopsis produced higher salt tolerance than wild-type plants. Localization analysis showed that TaNIP proteins tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) were localized to the cell plasma membrane. Under salt stress treatment, TaNIP-overexpressing Arabidopsis accumulated higher K(+), Ca(2+) and proline contents and lower Na(+) level than the wild-type plants. The overexpression of TaNIP in transgenic Arabidopsis also up-regulated the expression of a number of stress-associated genes. Our results suggest that TaNIP plays an important role in salt tolerance in Arabidopsis and can also enhance plants' tolerance to other abiotic stresses."

"22569921","abstracttext","An autophagy-related gene Atg8 was cloned for the first time from wild emmer wheat, named as TdAtg8, and its role on autophagy under abiotic stress conditions was investigated. Examination of TdAtg8 expression patterns indicated that Atg8 expression was strongly upregulated under drought stress, especially in the roots when compared to leaves. LysoTracker(®) red marker, utilized to observe autophagosomes, revealed that autophagy is constitutively active in Triticum dicoccoides. Moreover, autophagy was determined to be induced in plants exposed to osmotic stress when compared to plants grown under normal conditions. Functional studies were executed in yeast to confirm that the TdATG8 protein is functional, and showed that the TdAtg8 gene complements the atg8∆::kan MX yeast mutant strain grown under nitrogen deficiency. For further functional analysis, TdATG8 protein was expressed in yeast and analyzed using Western immunoblotting. Atg8-silenced plants were exposed to drought stress and chlorophyll and malondialdehyde (MDA) content measurements demonstrated that Atg8 plays a key role on drought stress tolerance. In addition, Atg8-silenced plants exposed to osmotic stress were found to have decreased Atg8 expression level in comparison to controls. Hence, Atg8 is a positive regulator in osmotic and drought stress response."

"25320556","abstracttext","Four extra early-flowering mutants, named extra early-flowering1 (exe1), exe2, exe3, and exe4, were identified in Triticum monococcum strain KU104-1 following heavy-ion beam mutagenesis. The four exe mutants fell into two groups, namely Type I (moderately extra early-flowering type; exe1 and exe3) and Type II (extremely extra early-flowering type; exe2 and exe4). Analysis of plant development in a growth chamber showed that the speed of leaf emergence was accelerated in exe mutants at the reproductive stage compared to wild-type (WT) plants. The speed of leaf emergence was faster in Type II than Type I plants. Analysis of VERNALIZATION 1 (VRN1), a flowering promoter gene, showed that it was more highly expressed in seedlings at early developmental stages in Type II mutants than Type I mutants. These findings indicate that the difference in earliness between Type I and Type II mutants is associated with the level of VRN1 expression. The original KU104-1 is an einkorn wheat strain that carries a null allele of the VRN2 gene, a repressor of flowering. Thus, our results indicate that the level of VRN1 expression controls earliness in exe mutants independently of VRN2."

Interval mapping located two QTL for yellow rust resistance on the long arm of chromosome 1B, while Kruskal-Wallis single marker regression identified a number of additional marker loci associated with seedling and/or adult plant, field resistance to yellow rust. These results suggested that much of the yellow rust resistance seen in the field may be due to seedling expressed resistance (R) genes. Characterization of the DNA sequence of three NBS marker loci indicated that all showed significant homology to functionally-characterized R-genes and resistance gene analogues (RGAs), with the greatest homology being NBS-LRR-type R-genes and RGAs from cereal species."

In addition, we found that highly expressed genes have greater codon bias than lowly expressed genes for both female- and male-specific genes. Moreover, in both species, genes with female-specific expression show a greater usage of species-specific preferred codons for each of the 18 amino acids having synonymous codons.

"24913125","abstracttext_key message","The expression of LcWRKY5 was induced significantly by salinity, mannitol and cutting treatments. Arabidopsis- overexpressing LcWRKY5 greatly increased dehydration tolerance by regulating the expression of multiple stress-responsive genes. Based on the data of sheepgrass 454 high-throughout sequencing and expression analysis results, a drought-induced gene LcWRKY5 was isolated and cloned, and the biological role of the gene has not been reported until now. Bioinformatics analysis showed that LcWRKY5 contains one conserved WD domain and belongs to the group II WRKY protein family. LcWRKY5 shows high sequence identity with predicted or putative protein products of Hordeum vulgare, Aegilops tauschii, Triticum aestivum, Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa, but it has low homology with WRKYs from dicotyledonous plants. Several drought-inducibility, fungal elicitor, MeJA-responsiveness, endosperm, light, anoxic specific inducibility, and circadian control elements were found in the promoter region of LcWRKY5. Tissue-specific expression patterns showed that LcWRKY5 is expressed in roots and leaves, without expression in other tissues. The expression of LcWRKY5 was induced significantly under salinity and mannitol stresses but was not notably changed under cold and Abscisic acid stress. The LcWRKY5 protein exhibits transcription activation activity in the yeast one-hybrid system. Overexpressing LcWRKY5 exhibited increased rates of cotyledon greening and plant survival in transgenic Arabidopsis compared with wild-type plants under drought stress, and the expression levels of DREB2A and RD29A in transgenic plants were enhanced under drought stress. These results indicated that LcWRKY5 may play an important role in drought-response networks through regulation of the DREB2A pathway. LcWRKY5 can be a candidate gene for engineering drought tolerance in other crops."

"32579348","abstracttext","The application of nanoparticles (NPs) to soils, as either fertilizers or fungicides (e.g., CuO NPs), has been proposed to improve the sustainability of agriculture. The observed effects could result directly from the NP-plant interactions or indirectly through effects on the soil microbiome. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of CuO NPs on the changes in the bacterial community structure and nitrogen-cycling-associated functions in a high pH soil and to correlate these changes with nitrate accumulation, soil parameter changes, and plant growth over 28 days. Triticum aestivum seedlings were exposed to 50 mg/kg CuO NPs, 50 mg/kg CuSO 4 , or 0.5 mg/kg CuSO 4 in a standard soil (Lufa 2.1 soil, pH adjusted to 7.6). While Cu treatments reduced nitrate accumulation in the bulk soil, the effects were opposite in the rhizosphere (the soil influenced by root exudates). While nitrate accumulation in bulk soil negatively correlated with total Cu concentration, part of the nitrate concentration in the rhizosphere was explained by root uptake during plant growth, the rest being modulated by Cu treatments. The abundance of genes involved in the nitrogen cycle in the rhizosphere soil correlated with the ionic copper concentration. The increased nitrate concentration in the rhizosphere correlated with an increase of the gene abundance related to the nitrogen fixation and a decrease of denitrification gene abundance. Microbial diversity in bulk or rhizosphere soil under the different treatments alone could not explain these variations, while differences in the assemblages of bacteria associated with these functional gene abundances gave good insights. This study highlights the complexity of microbial N-related function in the rhizosphere and the need to characterize the rhizosphere soil, plant growth and root activity, NP (bio)transformations, along with microbial networks, to understand the impact of agrochemicals (here CuO NPs) on soil fertility."

"24185890","abstracttext","Near-isogenic lines (NILs) for the leaf rust resistance gene Lr9 were screened for polymorphisms at the molecular level.

Specific primers were synthesized, and after amplification only resistant lines showed an amplified product. Thus, these primers define a sequence-tagged site that is specific for the translocated fragment carrying the Lr9 gene. A cross between a resistant NIL and the spelt (Triticum spelta) variety 'Oberkulmer' was made, and F2 plants were analyzed for genetic linkage. All three polymorphisms detected by the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and one RFLP marker (cMWG684) showed complete linkage to the Lr9 gene in 156 and 133 plants analyzed, respectively. A second RFLP marker (PSR546) was closely linked (8±2.4 cM) to the Lr9 gene and the other four DNA markers. As this marker maps to the distal part of the long arm of chromosome 6B of wheat, Lr9 and the other DNA markers also map to the distal region of 6BL. All three PCR markers detected the Lr9 gene in independently derived breeding lines and varieties, thus proving their general applicability in wheat breeding programs."

"24205793","abstracttext","The English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae (F.) (Homoptera: Aphididae), is a dominant and destructive pest in wheat, Triticum estivum L. (Poales: Poaceae), production regions in China and other grain-growing areas worldwide. Patterns of gene expression of the S. avenae-resistant synthetic wheat line 98-10-35, the S. avenae-susceptible line1376, and their hybrid population, and the differences in segments between 98-10-35/1376 F₃ resistant plants and resistant parents of 98-10-35, as well as those between the F3 resistant and susceptible populations, were examined with differential display reverse transcription PCR. The results showed that five patterns of differential expression were detected between the progeny and its resistant parents: 1) The gene was silenced in one of the parents; 2) Special expression showed in the progeny; 3) Expression was consistent with the resistant parents; 4) Up expression showed in the progeny but not in the parents; 5) Down expression showed in the progeny but not in the parents. Paired t-test results were not significant; however, the probability value (0.9158) indicated that gene expression on the RNA level were consistent with resistant bands found in F3 resistant individuals and resistant parents, as well as the F₃ resistant and susceptible populations. For both the F₃ of 98-10-35/1376 and the parents, the total number of amplified bands was 202, with an average of 25.3 per primer. The number of differential bands was 116, with an average of 14.5 per primer amplified and a polymorphism ratio of 56.3%. In the present study, differential expression genes in the resistant line 98-10-35 were all up-regulated. Among them, gene expression of resistant groups in the F₃ population was in agreement with patterns 2, 3, and 4. However, the susceptible line 1376 did not have this gene expression on the RNA level. This pattern is expected to be used to select and analyze target genes from the same F₃ population and the resistant parents. The results suggest that it can be employed as a new method for molecular assisted breeding."

"29075873","abstracttext_main conclusion","A and B genome copies of DRF1 gene in durum wheat were isolated and sequenced using gene variability. B genome specific polymorphism resulted, in a RIL population, in relationship with grain yield mainly in drought condition. Drought tolerance is one of the main components of yield potential and stability, and its improvement is a major challenge to breeders. Transcription factors are considered among the best candidate genes for developing functional markers, since they are components of the signal transduction pathways that coordinate the expression of several downstream genes. Polymorphisms of the Triticum durum dehydration responsive factor 1 (TdDRF1) gene that belongs to DREB2 transcription factor family were identified and specifically assigned to the A or B genome. A panel of primers was derived to selectively isolate the corresponding gene copies. These molecular information were also used to develop a new molecular marker: an allele-specific PCR assay discriminating two genotypes (Mohawk and Cocorit) was developed and used for screening a durum wheat recombinant inbred line population (RIL-pop) derived from the above genotypes. Phenotypic data from the RIL-pop grown during two seasons, under different environmental conditions, adopting an α-lattice design with two repetitions, were collected, analyzed and correlated with molecular data from the PCR assay. A significant association between a specific polymorphism in the B genome copy of the TdDRF1 gene and the grain yield in drought conditions were observed."

"17380427","abstracttext","Study of the structure of high molecular weight (Mr) glutenin subunits and their interaction has been limited by the difficulty of isolating single subunits in large amounts from the complex mixture of gluten wheat endosperm. One way to overcome this problem is the expression of high Mr glutenin subunits in heterologous systems. These systems have the additional advantages that, specific gene modifications can be made and the new gene constructs can quickly be expressed. HMW glutenin gene subunits, associated with better dough quality, were isolated from wheat (T. aestivum var. PBW343) using allele specific primers (AS-PCR) designed on allelic gene sequences. Three glutenin genes 1Ax1, Dx5 and Dy10 of sizes 1.8, 2.0 and 1.47 kb were cloned and sequenced. Probable secondary structure of HMW glutenin protein was predicted using online ExPASy server. HMW glu Dx5 and Dy10 gave significant similarity (more than 90%) to the available database but, 1Ax1 didn't show significant similarity. Glutenin genes were further subcloned in expression vector pCAMBIA-1304 driven by CaMV35S promoter and their expression was observed in Escherichia coli. The transcription was confirmed by Reverse transcriptase PCR (Rt-PCR) and sequencing. The sequences of HMW glu genes showed 100% homology with cloned HMW glutenin genes. Although initial western blotting using polyclonal antibodies against glutenin protein has strongly indicated its expression at the translation level, it is needed to be further confirmed through purification and sequencing of proteins."
"12845433","articletitle","Microsatellite analysis reveals a progressive widening of the genetic basis in the elite durum wheat germplasm."
"12845433","abstracttext","It has been argued that the level of genetic diversity in the modern durum wheat ( Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) elite germplasm may have declined due to the high selection pressure applied in breeding programs. In this study, 58 accessions covering a wide spectrum of genetic diversity of the cultivated durum wheat gene pool were characterized with 70 microsatellite loci (or simple sequence repeats, SSRs). On average, SSRs detected 5.6 different allelic variants per locus, with a mean diversity index (DI) equal to 0.56, thus revealing a diversity content comparable to those previously observed with SSRs in other small-grain cereal gene pools. The mean genetic similarity value was equal to 0.44. A highly diagnostic SSR set has been identified. A high variation in allele size was detected among SSR loci, suggesting a different suitability of these loci for estimating genetic diversity. The B genome was characterized by an overall polymorphism significantly higher than that of the A genome. Genetic diversity is organised in well-distinct sub-groups identified by the corresponding foundation-genotypes. A large portion (92.7%) of the molecular variation detected within the group of 45 modern cvs was accounted for by SSR alleles tracing back to ten foundation-genotypes; among those, the most recent CIMMYT-derived founders were genetically distant from the old Mediterranean ones. On the other hand, rare alleles were abundant, suggesting that a large number of genetic introgressions contributed to the foundation of the well-diversified germplasm herein considered. The profiles of recently released varieties indicate that the level of genetic diversity present in the modern durum wheat germplasm has actually increased over time."
"12923624","articletitle","Precise mapping of a locus affecting grain protein content in durum wheat."
"12923624","abstracttext","Grain protein content (GPC) is an important factor in pasta and breadmaking quality, and in human nutrition. It is also an important trait for wheat growers because premium prices are frequently paid for wheat with high GPC. A promising source for alleles to increase GPC was detected on chromosome 6B of Triticum turgidum var. dicoccoides accession FA-15-3 (DIC). Two previous quantitative trait locus (QTL) studies found that the positive effect of DIC-6B was associated to a single locus located between the centromere and the Nor-B2 locus on the short arm of chromosome 6B. Microsatellite markers Xgwm508 and Xgwm193 flanking the QTL region were used in this study to develop 20 new homozygous recombinant substitution lines (RSLs) with crossovers between these markers. These 20 RSLs, plus nine RSLs developed in previous studies were characterized with four new RFLP markers located within this chromosome segment. Grain protein content was determined in three field experiments organized as randomized complete block designs with ten replications each. The QTL peaks for protein content were located in the central region of a 2.7-cM interval between RFLP markers Xcdo365 and Xucw67 in the three experiments. Statistical analyses showed that almost all lines could be classified unequivocally within low- and high- protein groups, facilitating the mapping of this trait as a single Mendelian locus designated Gpc-6B1. The Gpc-6B1 locus was mapped 1.5-cM proximal to Xcdo365 and 1.2-cM distal to Xucw67. These new markers can be used to reduce the size of the DIC chromosome segment selected in marker-assisted selection programs. Markers Nor-B2 and Xucw66 flanking the previous two markers can be used to select against the DIC segment and reduce the linkage drag during the transfer of Gpc-6B1 into commercial bread and pasta wheat varieties. The precise mapping of the high GPC gene, the high frequency of recombinants recovered in the targeted region, and the recent development of a tetraploid BAC library including the Gpc-6B1 DIC allele are the first steps towards the map-based cloning of this gene."

"18470084","abstracttext","Six accessions of Triticum turgidum var. dicoccoides L. (4x, AABB) of diverse origin were tested with 10 races of leaf rust (Puccinia recondita f.sp. tritici Rob. ex Desm.) and 10 races of stem rust (P. graminis f.sp. tritici Eriks. &Henn.). Their infection type patterns were all different from those of lines carrying the Lr or Sr genes on the A or B genome chromosomes with the same races. The unique reaction patterns are probably controlled by genes for leaf rust or stem rust resistance that have not been previously identified. The six dicoccoides accessions were crossed with leaf rust susceptible RL6089 durum wheat and stem rust susceptible 'Kubanka' durum wheat to determine the inheritance of resistance. They were also crossed in diallel to see whether they carried common genes. Seedlings of F1, F2, and BC1F2 generations from the crosses of the dicoccoides accessions with RL6089 were tested with leaf rust race 15 and those from the crosses with 'Kubanka' were tested with stem rust race 15B-1. The F2 populations from the diallel crosses were tested with both races. The data from the crosses with the susceptible durum wheats showed that resistance to leaf rust race 15 and stem rust race 15B-1 in each of the six dicoccoides accessions is conferred by a single dominant or partially dominant gene. In the diallel crosses, the dominance of resistance appeared to be affected by different genetic backgrounds. With one exception, the accessions carry different resistance genes: CI7181 and PI 197483 carry a common gene for resistance to leaf rust race 15. Thus, wild emmer wheat has considerable genetic diversity for rust resistance and is a promising source of new rust resistance genes for cultivated wheats."

"17362350","abstracttext","High molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) 1Bx23, an x-type subset encoded by Glu-B1p, which is only distributed in Triticum turgidum, was successfully transferred from hexaploid triticale to common wheat line SY95-71. Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) shows that subunit 1Bx23 has a faster mobility than subunit 1Bx7 and 1Bx20, but slower than 1Bx17. Primers designed from the conserved regions in wheat HMW-GS gene promoter and coding sequences were used to amplify the genomic DNA of SY95-71. Total nucleotide sequences of 3426 bp including an open reading frame of 2385 bp and upstream sequence of 1038 bp were obtained. Compared with the reported gene sequences of Glu-B1-1 alleles, including 1Bx7, 1Bx14, 1Bx20 and 1Bx17, the promoter region of the 1Bx23 was displayed close to 1Bx7 and 1Bx17. The deduced amino acid sequence of coding region of 1Bx23 exhibited 34, 30, 20 and 22 amino acid substitutions from that of 1Bx14, 1Bx20, 1Bx7 and 1Bx17, respectively. A phylogenetic tree based on the nucleotide sequence alignment of the Glu-1Bx alleles shows that the 1Bx23 are apparently clustered with 1Bx7 and 1Bx17, and more ancient than 1Bx14 and 1Bx20, suggesting that the evolution speeds are different among Glu-1Bx genes. Additionally, the potential use of wheat line SY95-71 to further screen the quality contribution of unique subunit 1Bx23 is also discussed."

"22198205","abstracttext","Powdery mildew (PM) caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), is one of the important foliar diseases of wheat that can cause serious yield losses. Breeding for cultivars with diverse resources of resistance is the most promising approach for combating this disease. The diploid A genome progenitor species of wheat are an important resource for new variability for disease resistance genes. An accession of Triticum boeoticum (A(b)A(b)) showed resistance against a number of Bgt isolates, when tested using detached leaf segments. Inheritance studies in a recombinant inbred line population (RIL), developed from crosses of PM resistant T. boeoticum acc. pau5088 with a PM susceptible T. monococcum acc. pau14087, indicated the presence of two powdery mildew resistance genes in T. boeoticum acc. pau5088. Analysis of powdery mildew infection and molecular marker data of the RIL population revealed that both powdery mildew resistance genes are located on the long arm of chromosome 7A. Mapping was conducted using an integrated linkage map of 7A consisting of SSR, RFLP, STS, and DArT markers. These powdery mildew resistance genes are tentatively designated as PmTb7A.1 and PmTb7A.2. The PmTb7A.2 is closely linked to STS markers MAG2185 and MAG1759 derived from RFLP probes which are linked to powdery mildew resistance gene Pm1. This indicated that PmTb7A.2 might be allelic to Pm1. The PmTb7A.1, flanked by a DArT marker wPt4553 and an SSR marker Xcfa2019 in a 4.3 cM interval, maps proximal to PmT7A.2. PmTb7A.1 is putatively a new powdery mildew resistance gene. The powdery mildew resistance genes from T. boeoticum are currently being transferred to cultivated wheat background through marker-assisted backcrossing, using T. durum as bridging species."

"23208548","abstracttext","A small number of stress-responsive genes, such as those of the mitochondrial F1F0-ATP synthase complex, are encoded by both the nucleus and mitochondria. The regulatory mechanism of these joint products is mysterious. The expression of 6-kDa subunit (MtATP6), a relatively uncharacterized nucleus-encoded subunit of F0 part, was measured during salinity stress in salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive cultivated wheat genotypes, as well as in the wild wheat genotypes, Triticum and Aegilops using qRT-PCR. The MtATP6 expression was suddenly induced 3 h after NaCl treatment in all genotypes, indicating an early inducible stress-responsive behavior. Promoter analysis showed that the MtATP6 promoter includes cis-acting elements such as ABRE, MYC, MYB, GTLs, and W-boxes, suggesting a role for this gene in abscisic acid-mediated signaling, energy metabolism, and stress response. It seems that 6-kDa subunit, as an early response gene and nuclear regulatory factor, translocates to mitochondria and completes the F1F0-ATP synthase complex to enhance ATP production and maintain ion homeostasis under stress conditions. These communications between nucleus and mitochondria are required for inducing mitochondrial responses to stress pathways. Dual targeting of 6-kDa subunit may comprise as a mean of inter-organelle communication and save energy for the cell. Interestingly, MtATP6 showed higher and longer expression in the salt-tolerant wheat and the wild genotypes compared to the salt-sensitive genotype. Apparently, salt-sensitive genotypes have lower ATP production efficiency and weaker energy management than wild genotypes; a stress tolerance mechanism that has not been transferred to cultivated genotypes."
"24310337","articletitle","Basic studies on hybrid wheat breeding : VIII. A new male sterility-fertility restoration system in common wheat utilizing the cytoplasms of Aegilops kotschyi and Ae. variabilis."
"24310337","abstracttext","The nuclei of 12 common wheats (genome constitution AABBDD) were placed into the cytoplasms of Aegilops kotschyi and Ae. variabilis (both C(u)C(u)S(v)S(v)) by repeated backcrosses. Using these nucleus-cytoplasm hybrids, male sterility-fertility restoration relationship was investigated. Male sterility was expressed by these cytoplasms only in Slm, Splt and Mch. The other nine common wheat nuclei gave normal fertility against these cytoplasms. These cytoplasms were compared with the Triticum timopheevi cytoplasm that is now widely used in the hybrid wheat breeding program in order to investigate their effects on important agronomic traits of the 12 common wheats: The kotschyi and variabilis cytoplasms were as good as the timopheevi cytoplasm in this respect.The F1 hybrid between (kotschyi)- or (variabilis)-Splt and CS showed normal fertility. Segregation of the fertiles and steriles in their F2 generations followed the simple Mendelian fashion, i.e., 3 fertile∶1 sterile. Thus, the fertility restoration in this case is mainly controlled by a single dominant gene which will be designated as Rfv1. To determine its location, ditelo-lBS and -lBL of CS were crossed as male parents to male sterile (kotschyi)- and (variabilis)-Splt. The F1 hybrids between the male sterile Spit's and CS ditelo-lBS became male fertile, while those between the male sterile Spit's and CS ditelo-lBL became completely male sterile. Thus, the location of the gene Rfv1 has been determined to be on the short arm of chromosome lB of CS. Furthermore, a close relationship between the fertility-restoring genes and the nucleolus organizer region was pointed out.Finally, the schemes of breeding the male sterile lines of a cultivar with these cytoplasms, and its maintainer line were formulated. The following two points were considered as the advantages of the present male sterility-fertility restoration system over that using the timopheevi cytoplasm in breeding hybrid wheat: (1) easier fertility restoration in F1 hybrids, and (2) no need of breeding the restorer line."

All polymorphic loci (but one) displayed high levels of polymorphism (≧ 10%). In Israel, the proportion of polymorphic loci per population, P, in wild wheat averaged 0.25 (range, 0.16-0.38), and the genetic diversity index, He averaged 0.07, (range, 0.03 - 0.12). (b) Altogether there were 110 alleles at the 50 putative loci tested (c) Genetic differentiation of populations included regional and local patterns: (i) The coefficients of genetic distance between populations were high (mean D = 0.10 range, 0.02 - 0.25), and indicated sharp genetic differentiation over short distances, (ii) Common (≧ 10%) but sporadic and localized alleles were frequent (76%), and (iii) Rare alleles were few (only 5 alleles). (d) The patterns of allozyme and spikelet variation in the wild gene pool were significantly correlated with, and partly predictable by, water factors, including those of precipitation, evaporation, and relative humidity as well as of soil type, (e) All six spikelet characters showed statistically significant variation among localities and (f) Allozymic variation was correlated with spikelet variation.These results suggest in T. dicoccoides: (i) the operation of natural selection in population genetic structure, (ii) local adaptive genetic differentiation caused by diversifying selection through climate and soil, and (iii) the guidelines for sampling these resources for use in wheat breeding programs."

Putative target genes were predicted for conserved and novel miRNAs, the majority of which interact with nucleic acids, according to GO terms relative to molecular function. Quantitative qPCR analysis showed that several miRNAs identified were differentially expressed in the mature (Z77) developmental stage compared to young (Z14) tissues.

"30861838","abstracttext","The objective of this study was to test the performance of four new wheat leaf rust resistance genes previously transferred from wild relatives of common wheat. Leaf rust resistance gene Lr43, in wheat germplasm line KS92WGRC16, was originally from Aegilops tauschii. A second resistance gene, in line KS92WGRC23, was transferred from Triticum monococcum var. monococcum. Two other genes, in lines KS93U3 and KS96WGRC34, were obtained from T. monococcum var. boeoticum. In greenhouse tests, the typical low infection types produced by these lines were fleck (;), immune (0), fleck with chlorosis (;C), and heterogeneous (X-) for KS92WGRC16, KS92WGRC23, KS96WGRC34, and KS93U3, respectively. In field tests in Kansas and Texas, KS92WGRC23 and KS92WGRC16 were highly resistant. KS93U3 was moderately resistant in Kansas but moderately resistant to moderately susceptible in Texas. KS96WGRC34 was moderately resistant in Kansas but moderately resistant to susceptible in Texas. Greenhouse adult-plant tests with race PBJL of Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici indicated that KS92WGRC16, KS92WGRC23, and KS96WGRC34 were highly resistant, but KS93U3 gave a moderately resistant reaction. Growth-chamber studies in different environments (12, 16, 20, and 24°C) showed slight temperature effects on the expression of resistance in KS96WGRC34 but not in the other lines. Tests with nine races of P. recondita f. sp. tritici indicated that only KS92WGRC16 was resistant to all the races. Races PNML and PNMQ were virulent on KS92WGRC23, and race TFGL was virulent on both KS93U3 and KS96WGRC34. The genes in the four germplasm lines should be used in combination with other resistance genes to prolong their usefulness."

"32290993","abstracttext","Abiotic stress results in massive loss of crop productivity throughout the world. Understanding the plant gene regulatory mechanisms involved in stress responses is very important. Annexins are a conserved multigene family of Ca-dependent, phospholipid-binding proteins with suggested functions in response to environmental stresses and signalling during plant growth and development. Annexins function to counteract oxidative stress, maintain cell redox homeostasis and enhance drought tolerance. A full-length cDNA of two genes (TdAnn6 and TdAnn12) encoding annexin proteins were isolated and characterised from Tunisian durum wheat varieties (Triticum turgidum L. subsp. durum cv. Mahmoudi). Analyses of the deduced proteins encoded by annexin cDNAs (TdAnn6 and TdAnn12) indicate the presence of the characteristic four repeats of 70-75 amino acids and the motifs proposed to be involved in Ca2+ binding. Gene expression patterns obtained by real-time PCR revealed differential temporal and spatial regulation of the two annexin genes in durum wheat under different abiotic stress conditions such as salt (NaCl 150mM), osmotic (10% polyethylene glycol 8000), ionic (LiCl 10mM), oxidative (H2O2), ABA (100µM), salicylic acid (10mM), cold (4°C) and heat (37°C) stress. The two annexin genes were not regulated by heavy metal stress (CdCl2 150µM). Moreover, heterologous expression of TdAnn6 and TdAnn12 in yeast improves its tolerance to abiotic stresses, suggesting annexin's involvement in theses stress tolerance mechanisms. Taken together, our results show that the two newly isolated wheat annexin might play an active role in modulating plant cell responses to abiotic stress responses."

Four Pt -isolates, representing three virulence phenotypes (BBBQJ, BBBSJ & EEEEE) and six Pgt -races TTKSK, JRCQC, TKTTF, QFCFC, TPMKC and TMLKC were used to evaluate 180 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross Rusty (rust susceptible) × PI 192051-1 (rust resistant) at the seedling stage. The RILs were also phenotyped at the adult-plant stage in a stem rust nursery in Ethiopia in 2017. The RILs were genotyped using the Illumina iSelect 9K wheat SNP array. PI 192051-1 carries a previously unidentified major Sr gene designated as QSr.ace-7A on chromosome arm 7AS and Lr gene Lr.ace-4A in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 4A. In addition, three minor Sr QTL QSr.ace-1A , QSr.ace-2B and QSr.ace-4A were mapped in PI 192051-1 on chromosomes 1AL, 2BL, and 4A, respectively Lr.ace-4A could be co-located or tightly linked to QSr.ace-4A Markers linked to the identified QTL/genes can be used for marker assisted selection.

"33297327","abstracttext","Members of the AP2 / ERF transcription factor family play critical roles in plant development, biosynthesis of key metabolites, and stress response. A detailed study was performed to identify TtAP2 s /ERF s in the durum wheat ( Triticum turgidum ssp. durum ) genome, which resulted in the identification of 271 genes distributed on chromosomes 1A-7B. By carrying 27 genes, chromosome 6A had the highest number of TtAP2 s /ERF s. Furthermore, a duplication assay of TtAP2 s /ERF s demonstrated that 70 duplicated gene pairs had undergone purifying selection. According to RNA-seq analysis, the highest expression levels in all tissues and in response to stimuli were associated with DRF and ERF subfamily genes. In addition, the results revealed that TtAP2/ERF genes have tissue-specific expression patterns, and most TtAP2/ERF genes were significantly induced in the root tissue. Additionally, 13 TtAP2/ERF genes (six ERF s, three DREB s, two DRF s, one AP2 , and one RAV ) were selected for further analysis via qRT-PCR of their potential in coping with drought and salinity stresses. The TtAP2/ERF genes belonging to the DREB subfamily were markedly induced under both drought-stress and salinity-stress conditions. Furthermore, docking simulations revealed several residues in the pocket sites of the proteins associated with the stress response, which may be useful in future site-directed mutagenesis studies to increase the stress tolerance of durum wheat. This study could provide valuable insights for further evolutionary and functional assays of this important gene family in durum wheat."
"20352182","articletitle","Fine-mapping of the leaf rust Lr34 locus in Triticum aestivum (L.) and characterization of large germplasm collections support the ABC transporter as essential for gene function."
"20352182","abstracttext","Leaf rust resistance gene Lr34 is likely the most important leaf rust gene characterized to date. It has been characterized as an adult plant resistance gene and is known to enhance the resistance of other leaf rust resistance genes and to condition resistance to a number of other diseases. Located on chromosome 7D, this gene was identified to be one of six co-located genes of which, an ABC transporter was shown to be the only valid candidate. Ten new molecular markers were developed spanning the Lr34 locus, including six novel microsatellite markers (cam), one insertion site-based polymorphism marker (caISBP), two single nucleotide polymorphisms (caSNP), and one gene-specific marker (caIND). Using these new markers and others that were previously published, a comparative fine map of the locus was constructed from five segregating populations representing 1,742 lines. Identification of a susceptible line with a recombination in the 4.9 kb interval between caSNP4 located in the ABC transporter gene and cam8 located just upstream of this gene provided further evidence to support the identity of the ABC transporter as Lr34 by ruling out four of the adjacent genes. Originally, three mutations forming two haplotypes had been described for the ABC transporter gene. A third combination of the three mutations and an additional rare mutation in exon 22 were subsequently described. We identified an additional novel mutation in exon 10 that would cause a frameshift and is likely non-functional. This mutation was only found in Lr34- lines and constituted a novel molecular haplotype. Characterization of two germplasm collections of 700 Triticum aestivum lines permitted us to gain an understanding of the frequency of the ABC haplotypes characterized to date and their distribution in germplasm from and around the world. In addition to the four haplotypes previously described, a fifth haplotype was found in two of the 700 lines from the germplasm collections. These lines displayed the deletion in indel 11 characteristic of Lr34+ lines, but are likely susceptible to leaf rust. Mapping and haplotyping data suggest that of all the markers described herein, marker caIND11 is the best diagnostic marker for marker-assisted selection of Lr34 because it is co-dominant, robust and with the exception of 2/700 lines, it is highly diagnostic. Other markers are also described to provide alternatives for laboratories with different technologies."

"17989954","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis West. f.sp. tritici, is one of the most damaging diseases of wheat worldwide. Forty genes for stripe rust resistance have been catalogued so far, but the majority of them are not effective against emerging pathotypes. Triticum monococcum and T. boeoticum have excellent levels of resistance to rusts, but so far, no stripe rust resistance gene has been identified or transferred from these species. A set of 121 RILs generated from a cross involving T. monococcum (acc. pau14087) and T. boeoticum (acc. pau5088) was screened for 3 years against a mixture of pathotypes under field conditions. The parental accessions were susceptible to all the prevalent pathotypes at the seedling stage, but resistant at the adult plant stage. Genetic analysis of the RIL population revealed the presence of two genes for stripe rust resistance, with one gene each being contributed by each of the parental lines. A linkage map with 169 SSR and RFLP loci generated from a set of 93 RILs was used for mapping these resistance genes. Based on phenotypic data for 3 years and the pooled data, two QTLs, one each in T. monococcum acc. pau14087 and T. boeoticum acc. pau5088, were detected for resistance in the RIL population. The QTL in T. monococcum mapped on chromosome 2A in a 3.6 cM interval between Xwmc407 and Xwmc170, whereas the QTL from T. boeoticum mapped on 5A in 8.9 cM interval between Xbarc151 and Xcfd12 and these were designated as QYrtm.pau-2A and QYrtb.pau-5A, respectively. Based on field data for 3 years, their R2 values were 14 and 24%, respectively. T. monococcum acc. pau14087 and three resistant RILs were crossed to hexaploid wheat cvs WL711 and PBW343, using T. durum as a bridging species with the objective of transferring these genes into hexaploid wheat. The B genome of T. durum suppressed resistance in the F1 plants, but with subsequent backcrossing one resistance gene could be transferred from one of the RILs to the hexaploid wheat background. This gene was derived from T. boeoticum acc. pau5088 as indicated by co-introgression of T. boeoticum sequences linked to stripe rust resistance QTL, QYrtb.pau-5A. Homozygous resistant progenies with 40-42 chromosomes have been identified."
"19039100","articletitle","Gene expression profiling and silencing reveal that monolignol biosynthesis plays a critical role in penetration defence in wheat against powdery mildew invasion."
"19039100","abstracttext","Cell wall apposition (CWA) formation is one of the first lines of defence used by plants to halt invading fungi such as powdery mildew. Lignin is a complex polymer of hydroxylated and methoxylated phenylpropane units (monolignols) and lignification renders the cell wall more resistant to pathogen attack. The role of monolignol biosynthesis in CWA-mediated defence against powdery mildew penetration into cereals is demonstrated here using RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene silencing and enzyme-specific inhibitors. Thirteen cDNAs representing eight genes involved in monolignol biosynthesis were cloned from an expression sequence tag (EST) library derived from the epidermis of diploid wheat (Triticum monococcum) infected with Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt). Differential expression patterns were found for these genes in susceptible and resistant plants after infection. Transcripts of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (CAOMT), ferulic acid hydroxylase (FAH), caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase (CCoAMT), and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) were accumulated, particularly in the epidermis. RNAi-mediated transient gene silencing in the epidermis led to a higher penetration efficiency of Bgt than in the controls. Gene silencing also compromised penetration resistance to varying degrees with different genes against an inappropriate pathogen, B. graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh). Co-silencing led to greater penetration of Bgt or Bgh than when the genes were silenced separately. Fluorescence emission spectra analyses revealed that gene silencing hampered host autofluorescence response at fungal contact sites. These results illustrate that monolignol biosynthesis is critically important for host defence against both appropriate and inappropriate pathogen invasion in wheat."

"9860141","abstracttext","The present work shows that replication of the 5 S ribosomal genes differs in time and 3'deoxyadenosine sensitivity from replication of other nuclear genes, in Allium cepa L. root meristems. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with the pTa794 DNA probe which contains a complete 410 bp 5 S gene from Triticum aestivum allowed to detect four clusters of 5 S genes in these diploid cells (2n = 16), two of them in the short arm of the smallest metacentric chromosomal pair 7. Replication of the 5 S ribosomal genes occurred very early in interphase, as discerned by their resolution as doubled spots only two hours after interphase was initiated in synchronous binucleate cells. Codetection of nuclear replication (by immunodetection of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation) showed that the replication of the 5 S ribosomal genes occurred before any incorporation of 5-bromo-2'deoxyuridine could be detected in the nuclei. The earliest Br-DNA detected in these cells followed a radial pattern from different foci apparently dispersed along some chromosomal arms. These structures seem to represent early replication complexes, as a result of the displacement of multiple DNA forks from the foci known as pre-replication complexes where the replication machinery of the earliest replicating genes assembles. No consistent positional correlation existed between the formation of the early replication complexes and the already replicated 5 S ribosomal clusters. Finally, nuclear replication but not that of the 5 S genes was prevented by 3'deoxyadenosine, and the earliest replicating 5 S ribosomal gene cluster differed in both sister nuclei resulting from the segregation of one single chromosome in anaphase."

"15644962","abstracttext","The genetic diversity of spelt (Triticum aestivum (L.) Thell. subsp. spelta (L.) Thell.) cultivated presently is very narrow. Although the germplasm collections of spelt are extensive, the related genetic knowledge is often lacking and makes their use for genetic improvement difficult. The genetic diversity and structure of the spelt gene pool held in gene banks was determined using 19 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers applied to 170 spelt accessions collected from 27 countries and 4 continents. The genetic distances (1 - proportion of shared alleles) were calculated and an unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averaging (UPGMA)-based dendrogram was generated. The genetic diversity was high: 259 alleles were found and the mean interaccession genetic distance was 0.782 +/- 0.141. The dendrogram demonstrated the much higher genetic diversity of spelt held in germplasm collections than in the currently used genotypes. Accessions with the same geographical origin often tended to cluster together. Those from the Middle East were isolated first. All but one of the Spanish accessions were found in a unique subcluster. Most accessions from eastern Europe clustered together, while those from northwestern Europe were divided into two subclusters. The accessions from Africa and North America were not separated from the European ones. This analysis demonstrates the extent of genetic diversity of spelts held in germplasm collections and should help to widen the genetic basis of cultivated spelt in future breeding programs."
"12771222","articletitle","Efficient clustering of large EST data sets on parallel computers."
"12771222","abstracttext","Clustering expressed sequence tags (ESTs) is a powerful strategy for gene identification, gene expression studies and identifying important genetic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms. To enable fast clustering of large-scale EST data, we developed PaCE (for Parallel Clustering of ESTs), a software program for EST clustering on parallel computers. In this paper, we report on the design and development of PaCE and its evaluation using Arabidopsis ESTs. The novel features of our approach include: (i) design of memory efficient algorithms to reduce the memory required to linear in the size of the input, (ii) a combination of algorithmic techniques to reduce the computational work without sacrificing the quality of clustering, and (iii) use of parallel processing to reduce run-time and facilitate clustering of larger data sets. Using a combination of these techniques, we report the clustering of 168 200 Arabidopsis ESTs in 15 min on an IBM xSeries cluster with 30 dual-processor nodes. We also clustered 327 632 rat ESTs in 47 min and 420 694 Triticum aestivum ESTs in 3 h and 15 min. We demonstrate the quality of our software using benchmark Arabidopsis EST data, and by comparing it with CAP3, a software widely used for EST assembly. Our software allows clustering of much larger EST data sets than is possible with current software. Because of its speed, it also facilitates multiple runs with different parameters, providing biologists a tool to better analyze EST sequence data. Using PaCE, we clustered EST data from 23 plant species and the results are available at the PlantGDB website."
"19577780","articletitle","Benzoxazinoid biosynthesis, a model for evolution of secondary metabolic pathways in plants."
"19577780","abstracttext","Benzoxazinoids are secondary metabolites that are effective in defence and allelopathy. They are synthesised in two subfamilies of the Poaceae and sporadically found in single species of the dicots. The biosynthesis is fully elucidated in maize; here the genes encoding the enzymes of the pathway are in physical proximity. This ""biosynthetic cluster"" might facilitate coordinated gene regulation. Data from Zea mays, Triticum aestivum and Hordeum lechleri suggest that the pathway is of monophyletic origin in the Poaceae. The branchpoint from the primary metabolism (Bx1 gene) can be traced back to duplication and functionalisation of the alpha-subunit of tryptophan synthase (TSA). Modification of the intermediates by consecutive hydroxylation is catalysed by members of a cytochrome P450 enzyme subfamily (Bx2-Bx5). Glucosylation by an UDP-glucosyltransferase (UGT, Bx8, Bx9) is essential for the reduction of autotoxicity of the benzoxazinoids. In some species 2,4-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one-glucoside (DIBOA-glc) is further modified by the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase BX6 and the O-methyltransferase BX7. In the dicots Aphelandra squarrosa, Consolida orientalis, and Lamium galeobdolon, benzoxazinoid biosynthesis is analogously organised: The branchpoint is established by a homolog of TSA, P450 enzymes catalyse hydroxylations and at least the first hydroxylation reaction is identical in dicots and Poaceae, the toxic aglucon is glucosylated by an UGT. Functionally, TSA and BX1 are indole-glycerolphosphate lyases (IGLs). Igl genes seem to be generally duplicated in angiosperms. Modelling and biochemical characterisation of IGLs reveal that the catalytic properties of the enzyme can easily be modified by mutation. Independent evolution can be assumed for the BX1 function in dicots and Poaceae."

"24189348","abstracttext","The resistance to glufosinate of two lines-genetically modified (GM) and unmodified (T-590 and T-549, respectively)-of Triticum aestivum has been studied. In the GM line, the bar gene was introduced to increase the resistance to glufosinate. Experiments in a controlled growth chamber showed that line T-590 presented a high resistance to glufosinate with an ED50 value of 478.59 g active ingredient per hectare (g ai ha(-1)) versus 32.65 g ai ha(-1) for line T-549. The activity of glutamine synthetase (GS) in leaf extracts from both lines was investigated. The I50 for line T-590 was 694.10 μM glufosinate versus 55.46 μM for line T-549, with a resistance factor of 12.51. Metabolism studies showed a higher and faster penetration of glufosinate in line T-549 than in line T-590. LC-TOF/MS analysis of glufosinate metabolism at 48 h after herbicide treatment (300 g ai ha(-1)) revealed an 83.4% conversion of the herbicide (66.5% in N-acetyl-glufosinate metabolite), while in line T-549 conversion of the herbicide was about 40% (0% to N-acetyl-glufosinate). These results suggest that metabolism of glufosinate by the bar gene is a key mechanism of resistance in line T-590 that explains such high levels of herbicide tolerated by the plant, together with other mechanisms due to unmodified pathway, absorption and loss of glufosinate affinity for its target site."
"28671251","articletitle","Identification and characterization of the bZIP transcription factor involved in zinc homeostasis in cereals."
"28671251","abstracttext","Members of the basic leucine zipper family, as bZIP19, are considered to be essential regulators of the adaptation to zinc deficiency. Knowing that this gene as well as its targets are conserved in the plant kingdom, we followed an in silico approach to identify and characterize the bzip19 gene in cereals. Through BLASTp in Phytozome database, 33 bzip19 genes were identified on the genomes of Oryza sativa, Sorghum bicolor, Zea mays, Glycine max, Triticum aestivum, and Brachypodium distachyon. The analysis of conserved motifs and bZIP domains was performed using MEME and PFAM databases. In 25 of these genes, CysHis-motifs at the basic N-terminal region were found. This motif is conserved in group bZIP and suggested to play a role as a Zn-sensor. Regarding their phylogeny, it was possible to infer orthologous groups and explore the evolutionary relationship between these BZIP19 proteins. Data mining allowed us to select eight putative orthologous whose expression profile was analyzed under stress conditions in the Genevestigator platform. The comparison between the expression profiles of these eight putative orthologous and the original Arabidopsis bzip19 also seems to indicate conserved transcriptional regulation. Thus, considering that modified expression of bZIP19 genes has already been confirmed as an efficient tool to improve Arabidopsis tolerance to Zn deficiency, and that these new bZIP orthologous have a high level of conservation when compared to the original bZIP19 sequence, they can be useful for the development of tolerant crops enabling plants to grow in areas of low zinc bioavailability."

"32366734","abstracttext","Laccases (LACs) are versatile enzymes that catalyze oxidation of a wide range of substrates, thereby functioning in regulation of plant developmental processes and stress responses. However, with a few exceptions, the function of most LACs remains unclear in plants. In this study, we newly identified 4, 12, 22, 26, 27, 28 and 49 LAC genes for Physcomitrella patens , Amborella trichopoda , Zeamays , Ricinus communis , Vitis vinifera , Triticum aestivum and Glycine max , on the basis of exhaustive homologous sequence searches. In these plants, LACs differ greatly in sequence length and physical properties, such as molecular weight and theoretical isoelectric point (pI), but majority of them contain a signal peptide at their N-terminus. The originality of LACs could be traced back to as early as the emergence of moss. Plant LACs are clearly divided into seven distinct classes, where six ancient LACs should be present prior to the divergence of gymnosperms and angiosperms. Functional divergence analysis reveal that functional differentiation should occur among different groups of LACs because of altered selective constraints working on some critical amino acid sites (CAASs) within conserved laccase domains during evolution. Soybean and maize LACs have significantly different exon frequency (6.08 vs 4.82), and they are unevenly distributed and tend to form gene clusters on some chromosomes. Further analysis shows that the expansion of LAC gene family would be due toextensive tandem and chromosomal segmental duplications in the two plant species. Interestingly, *81.6% and 36.4% of soybean and maize LACs are potential targets of miRNAs, such as miR397a/b, miR408d, or miR528a/b etc. Both soybean and maize LACs are tissue specifically and developmental-specifically expressed, and are in response to different external abiotic and biotic stressors. These results suggest a diversity of functions of plant LAC genes, which will broaden our understanding and lay solid foundation for further investigating their biological functions in plants."

"31292649","abstracttext","In higher plants, the post-translational modification of target proteins via the attachment of molecules such as ubiquitin (Ub) mediates a variety of cellular functions via the Ub/26S proteasome system. Here, a really interesting new gene (RING)-H2 type E3 ligase, which regulates target proteins via the Ub/26S proteasome system, was isolated from a rice plant, and its other grass orthologs were examined to determine the evolution of its molecular function during speciation. The gene encoding Oryza sativa cytoplasmic-localized RING finger protein 1 (OsCLR1) was highly expressed under salt and drought stresses. By contrast, the three grass orthologs, SbCLR1 from Sorghum bicolor, ZmCLR1 from Zea mays and TaCLR1 from Triticum aestivum, showed different responses to these stresses. Despite these differences, all four orthologs exhibited E3 ligase activity with cytosol-targeted localization, demonstrating conserved molecular functions. Although OsCLR1-overexpressing plants showed higher survival rates under both salt and drought stresses than that of the wild type (WT) plants, this pattern was not observed in the other orthologs. In addition, OsCLR1-overexpressing plants exhibited lower germination rates in ABA than that of WT plants, whereas the three ortholog CLR1-overexpressing plants showed rates similar to the WT plants. These results indicate the positive regulation of OsCLR1 in response to salt and drought in an ABA-dependent manner. Despite the molecular functions of the three CLR1 orthologs remaining largely unknown, our results provide an insight into the evolutionary fate of CLR1 grass orthologs during speciation after the divergence from a common ancestor."

"29515598","abstracttext","Sodium (Na + ) accumulation in the cytosol will result in ion homeostasis imbalance and toxicity of transpiring leaves. Studies of salinity tolerance in the diploid wheat ancestor Triticum monococcum showed that HKT1;5 -like gene was a major gene in the QTL for salt tolerance, named Nax2 . In the present study, we were interested in investigating the molecular mechanisms underpinning the role of the HKT1;5 gene in salt tolerance in barley ( Hordeum vulgare ). A USDA mini-core collection of 2,671 barley lines, part of a field trial was screened for salinity tolerance, and a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) was performed. Our results showed important SNPs that are correlated with salt tolerance that mapped to a region where HKT1;5 ion transporter located on chromosome four. Furthermore, sodium (Na + ) and potassium (K + ) content analysis revealed that tolerant lines accumulate more sodium in roots and leaf sheaths, than in the sensitive ones. In contrast, sodium concentration was reduced in leaf blades of the tolerant lines under salt stress. In the absence of NaCl, the concentration of Na + and K + were the same in the roots, leaf sheaths and leaf blades between the tolerant and the sensitive lines. In order to study the molecular mechanism behind that, alleles of the HKT1;5 gene from five tolerant and five sensitive barley lines were cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis did not show the presence of any polymorphism that distinguishes between the tolerant and sensitive alleles. Our real-time RT-PCR experiments, showed that the expression of HKT1;5 gene in roots of the tolerant line was significantly induced after challenging the plants with salt stress. In contrast, in leaf sheaths the expression was decreased after salt treatment. In sensitive lines, there was no difference in the expression of HKT1;5 gene in leaf sheath under control and saline conditions, while a slight increase in the expression was observed in roots after salt treatment. These results provide stronger evidence that HKT1;5 gene in barley play a key role in withdrawing Na + from the xylem and therefore reducing its transport to leaves. Given all that, these data support the hypothesis that HKT1;5 gene is responsible for Na + unloading to the xylem and controlling its distribution in the shoots, which provide new insight into the understanding of this QTL for salinity tolerance in barley."

"13677634","abstracttext","The present study establishes a regeneration protocol and optimizes conditions for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of the tetraploid emmer wheat, Triticum dicoccum. Regeneration from mature and immature embryos was accomplished as a two-step process involving callus induction in the presence of 2,4-D followed by regeneration on a 2,4-D free, cytokinin-containing medium (RM1). Higher concentrations of 2,4-D (4 mg/l) though conducive for callusing (89.39% in mature embryos and 96% in immature embryos) proved detrimental for further regeneration. At lower 2,4-D (1 mg/ml) although callusing was suboptimal, (56.8% and 84% from mature and immature embryos, respectively) the regeneration response was the highest on RM1 medium (64.4% and 56.6% from mature and immature embryos, respectively). Overall, the regeneration response of immature embryos was lower than the mature embryos by 10-12%. Due to the ease of availability of mature embryos the mature embryo-derived calli were chosen as the target tissue for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation in the two Indian varieties DDK1001 and DDK1009. Histochemical GUS expression revealed the suitability of the mature embryo-derived calli for such investigations. Of the CaMV35S and Act1 promoters employed, the monocot promoter Act1 displayed higher GUS gene activity in the mature embryo derived calli when co-cultivated with LBA4404 (pBI101::Act1)."

"15619078","abstracttext","The objective of this study was to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the vernalization response in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). The mapping population consisted of 184 F2 genotypes produced from a cross between one genotype of a synthetic perennial ryegrass variety ""Veyo"" and one genotype from the perennial ryegrass ecotype ""Falster"". Veyo and Falster were chosen among four different populations because of their contrasting vernalization requirements. In total, five QTL for the vernalization response, measured as days to heading, were identified and mapped to linkage groups (LG) LG2, LG4, LG6 and LG7. Individually, these QTL explained between 5.4 and 28.0% of the total phenotypic variation. The overall contribution of these five QTL was 80% of the total phenotypic variation. A putative orthologue of Triticum monococcum VRN1 was amplified from genomic DNA from perennial ryegrass. PCR fragments covering the proximal part of the promoter and the 5' end of the orthologue were subsequently PCR-amplified from both parents of the mapping population and shown to possess 95% DNA sequence identity to VRN1. Several polymorphisms were identified between Veyo and Falster in this fragment of the putative VRN1 orthologue. A CAPS marker, vrn-1, was developed and found to co-segregate with a major QTL on LG4 for the vernalization response. This indicates that the CAPS marker vrn-1 could be located in an orthologous gene of the wheat VRN1."
"18356954","articletitle","Genetic structure of wild emmer wheat populations as reflected by transcribed versus anonymous SSR markers."
"18356954","abstracttext","Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers have become a major tool in population genetic analyses. The anonymous genomic SSRs (gSSRs) have been recently supplemented with expressed sequence tag (EST) derived SSRs (eSSRs), which represent the transcribed regions of the genome. In the present study, we used 8 populations of wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum subsp. dicoccoides) to compare the usefulness of the two types of SSR markers in assessing allelic diversity and population structure. gSSRs revealed significantly higher diversity than eSSRs in terms of average number of alleles (14.92 vs. 7.4, respectively), polymorphic information content (0.87 vs. 0.68, respectively), and gene diversity (He; 0.55 vs. 0.38, respectively). Despite the overall differences in the level of diversity, Mantel tests for correlations between eSSR and gSSR pairwise genetic distances were found to be significant for each population as well as for all accessions jointly (RM=0.54, p=0.01). Various genetic structure analyses (AMOVA, PCoA, STRUCTURE, unrooted UPGMA tree) revealed a better capacity of eSSRs to distinguish between populations, while gSSRs showed a higher proportion of intrapopulation (among accessions) diversity. We conclude that eSSR and gSSR markers should be employed in conjunction to obtain a high inter- and intra-specific (or inter- and intra-varietal) distinctness."

The resulting 220 positive BAC clones--each containing between one and four copies of alpha-gliadin sequences--were fingerprinted for contig assembly to produce contiguous chromosomal regions covering the Gli-2 loci. While contigs consisting of as many as 21 BAC clones and containing up to 17 alpha-gliadin genes were formed, many BAC clones remained as singletons. The accuracy of the order of BAC clones in the contigs was verified by Southern hybridization analysis of the BAC fingerprints using an alpha-gliadin probe. These results indicate that alpha-gliadin genes are not evenly dispersed in the Gli-2 locus regions. Hybridization of these BACs with probes for long terminal repeat retrotransposons was used to determine the abundance and distribution of repetitive DNA in this region. Sequencing of BAC ends indicated that 70% of the sequences were significantly similar to different classes of retrotransposons, suggesting that these elements are abundant in this region. Several mechanisms underlying the dynamic evolution of the Gli-2 loci are discussed."

"16079999","abstracttext","At least two types of quinone reductases are present in plants: (1) the zeta-crystallin-like quinone reductases (QR1, EC 1.6.5.5) that catalyze the univalent reduction of quinones to semiquinone radicals, and (2) the DT-diaphorase-like quinone reductases (QR2, EC 1.6.99.2) that catalyze the divalent reduction of quinones to hydroquinones. QR2s protect cells from oxidative stress by making the quinones available for conjugation, thereby releasing them from the superoxide-generating one electron redox cycling, catalyzed by QR1s. Two genes, putatively encoding a QR1 and a QR2, respectively, were isolated from an expressed sequence tag collection derived from the epidermis of a diploid wheat Triticum monococcum L. 24 h after inoculation with the powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis (DC) EO Speer f. sp. tritici Em.

Heterologous expression of TmQR2 in Escherichia coli confirmed that the gene encoded a functional, dicumarol-inhibitable QR2 that could use either NADH or NADPH as an electron donor. The localization of dicumarol-inhibitable QR2 activity around powdery mildew infection sites was accomplished using a histochemical technique, based on tetrazolium dye reduction."
"19251764","articletitle","The CArG-box located upstream from the transcriptional start of wheat vernalization gene VRN1 is not necessary for the vernalization response."
"19251764","abstracttext","In diploid wheat (Triticum monococcum), and likely in other Triticeae species, the VRN1 gene is essential for the initiation of the reproductive phase, and therefore, a detailed characterization of its regulatory regions is required to understand this process. A CArG-box (MADS-box-binding site) identified in the VRN1 promoter upstream from the transcription initiation site has been proposed as a critical regulatory element for the vernalization response. This hypothesis was supported by the genetic linkage between CArG-box natural deletions and dominant Vrn1 alleles for spring growth habit and by physical interactions with VRT2, a MADS-box protein proposed as a putative flowering repressor regulated by vernalization. Here, we describe a T. monococcum accession with a strong vernalization requirement and a 48-bp deletion encompassing the CArG-box in the VRN1 promoter. Genetic analyses of 2 segregating populations confirmed that this VRN1 allele is completely linked with a strong winter growth habit (vrn-A(m)1b). Transcript levels of the VRN1 allele with the 48-bp deletion were very low in unvernalized plants and increased during vernalization to levels similar to those detected in other wild-type vrn-A(m)1 alleles. Taken together, these results indicate that the CArG-box found upstream of the VRN1 transcription initiation site is not essential for the vernalization response."

"17248744","abstracttext","Lower levels of monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) have been found in tetraploid wheats as compared with those in hexaploid wheats. The same difference has been found between hexaploid cultivars and tetraploid lines derived from them by D genome extraction. A lower level of MGDG and DGDG is also present in Triticum carthlicum (AABB) as compared with Aegilops squarrosa (DD) or with the synthetic T. spelta (AABBDD) obtained from them. Analysis of the appropriate nullitetrasomic and ditelosomic lines indicates that a gene or genes located in the short arm of chromosome 5D are responsible for the observed difference and that group 5 chromosomes can be ranked as to their influence on the MGDG and DGDG levels in the order 5B > 5D > 5A and 5D > 5B > 5A, respectively. These results further support our previous identification of DGDG as the lipid factor responsible for petroleum ether solubility of lipopurothionins. Since DGDG contributes to baking quality by improving the retention of fermentation gases, the present observations imply that the difference in bread-making quality between the two types of wheat is not due only to proteins contributed by the D genome."

"17381042","abstracttext","According to the two distal and conserved regions of known alpha-gliadin genes, gene-specific primers for alpha-gliadin were designed, and the coding regions of four gliadin genes (i.e. GliTd-1, GliTd-2, GliTd-3 and GliTd-4) with the length of about 800 bp were isolated from the genomic DNA of wild emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccoides). No introns were observed. Sequence comparison indicated that these genes should be classified as alpha-gliadins. GliTd-3 (GenBank accession No.DQ140351) and GliTd-4 (DQ140352) were potentially functional, whereas GliTd-1 (DQ140349) and GliTd-2 (DQ140350) were both pseudogenes by the definition of in-frame stop codons and frameshifts. Six conserved cysteine residues were observed. Sequence analysis suggested that the motif units of repetitive domain for the four newly detected genes were different from the known genes, and the QQQP sequence before the position 60 was more toxic to coeliac patients. Codons for proline were strongly biased. Codons (CAG and CAA) for glutamine were clustered into the specific regions, and the high percentage of pseudogenes resulted from the mutation of CAG --> TAG."

"16995914","abstracttext","Here we examined several physiological properties of two near-isogenic lines of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum var. durum) that differ in grain cadmium accumulation, to identify the function of a gene locus that confers differential grain Cd concentrations. Time- and concentration-dependent uptake and translocation studies using 109Cd were conducted on nutrient solution-grown seedlings. Root extracts were analysed by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry, gel filtration and capillary electrophoresis to determine the interaction between Cd and phytochelatins (PCs) in storage of Cd in roots. The two isolines did not differ in time- or concentration-dependent root Cd uptake, but the low grain-Cd-accumulating isoline showed decreased movement of Cd from roots to shoots. All buffer-soluble Cd extracted from roots of both isolines was in the form of a low-molecular-weight PC-containing complex. The data suggest that PC synthesis is not a limiting factor in the differential storage of Cd in roots, and that movement of Cd through the root and into the transpiration stream may be the cause of differential Cd partitioning in the two isolines."

In addition to its agronomic importance, maize has been a keystone model organism for basic research for nearly a century. Within the cereals, which include other plant model species such as rice (Oryza sativa), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), wheat (Triticum spp.), and barley (Hordeum vulgare), maize is the most thoroughly researched genetic system. Several attributes of the maize plant, including a vast collection of mutant stocks, large heterochromatic chromosomes, extensive nucleotide diversity, and genic colinearity within related grasses, have positioned this species as a centerpiece for genetic, cytogenetic, and genomic research. As a model organism, maize is the subject of such far-ranging biological investigations as plant domestication, genome evolution, developmental physiology, epigenetics, pest resistance, heterosis, quantitative inheritance, and comparative genomics. These and other studies will be advanced by the completed sequencing and annotation of the maize gene space, which will be realized during 2009. Here we present an overview of the use of maize as a model system and provide links to several protocols that enable its genetic and genomic analysis."

"23853511","abstracttext","The yellow-green leaf mutant has a non-lethal chlorophyll-deficient mutation that can be exploited in photosynthesis and plant development research. A novel yellow-green mutant derived from Triticum durum var. Cappelli displays a yellow-green leaf color from the seedling stage to the mature stage. Examination of the mutant chloroplasts with transmission electron microscopy revealed that the shape of chloroplast changed, grana stacks in the stroma were highly variable in size and disorganized. The pigment content, including chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll and carotene, was decreased in the mutant. In contrast, the chla/chlb ratio of the mutants was increased in comparison with the normal green leaves. We also found a reduction in the photosynthetic rate, fluorescence kinetic parameters and yield-related agronomic traits of the mutant. A genetic analysis revealed that two nuclear recessive genes controlled the expression of this trait. The genes were designated ygld1 and ygld2. Two molecular markers co-segregated with these genes. ygld 1 co-segregated with the SSR marker wmc110 on chromosome 5AL and ygld 2 co-segregated with the SSR marker wmc28 on chromosome 5BL. These results will contribute to the gene cloning and the understanding of the mechanisms underlying chlorophyll metabolism and chloroplast development in wheat."

Grossly, the VNO, encased by cartilage, has a paired tubular structure with a caudal blind end and a rostral connection through incisive ducts on the hard palate. In the VNO, the vomeronasal sensory epithelium (VSE) consists of galectin-3-positive supporting cells, protein gene product (PGP) 9.5-positive receptor cells, and basal cells. The vomeronasal respiratory epithelium (VRE) consists of a pseudostratified epithelium. The AOB strata included a vomeronasal nerve layer (VNL), a glomerular layer (GL), a mitral/tufted cell layer, and a granular cell layer. All lectins used in this study, including Bandeiraea simplicifolia agglutinin isolectin B4 (BSI-B4), soybean agglutinin (SBA), Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA-I), and Triticum vulgaris wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), labeled the VSE with varying intensity. In the AOB, both the VNL and the GL reacted with BSI-B4, SBA, and WGA with varying intensity, but not with UEA-I. This is the first morphological study of the VNO and AOB of the Korean roe deer, which are similar to those of goats."

Both T. durum and Th. distichum contained two pairs of satellited chromosomes, which could be distinguished from one another. In the amphiploids [T. durum×Th. distichum (2x=56)] and in the backcross T. durum/(T. durum×Th. distichum)(2), BC1F3, and BC1F5 (2n = 42) the satellite was visible on only 1B and 6B of T. durum. The vector pTa 71 containing the rRNA gene from wheat hybridized to two pairs of chromosomes (four hybridization sites) in T. durum and Th. distichum, to eight sites in the amphiploid hybrid (2n=56), and to six sites in the backcross populations BC1F1. BC1F3, and BC1F5 (2n=42). The two satellite pairs in Th. distichum could be distinguished by the chromosomal location of the rRNA site (median or subterminal) and by the centromere position. One copy of each pair was present in the BC1F1, but in the BC1F3 and BC1F5 populations the pair with the subterminal location of rRNA genes was absent. Silver nitrate staining indicated that the rRNA genes of T. durum did not completely suppress those of Th. distichum.

"24241524","abstracttext","In bacterial and mammalian cells, N-(phosphonoacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA) suppresses growth by strongly inhibiting aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase; EC 2.1.3.2), a key enzyme of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. At a concentration that would suppress growth in mammalian or bacterial cells, and that is nearly a million-fold greater than the inhibition constant (K i ) for ATCase in carrot (Daucus carota) seedling extracts, PALA does not suppress growth of carrot cells in suspension culture. To study this anomaly an assay based on the inhibition of wheat (Triticum vulgare) ATCase (K i =2 nM) was developed. Using this assay it was found that PALA is detoxified relatively rapidly by low inocula of carrot cells. The detoxification product accumulates in the extracellular fluid although the enzyme(s) responsible is intracellular or in the cell wall. The PALA-detoxifying activity can be detected at all stages of the growth cycle in culture, but reaches a maximum early in the exponential phase of growth. Cells that were repeatedly subcultured into media initially containing 1 mM PALA had the same low level of ATCase activity as control cells; there was no evidence of the amplification of the gene for this enzyme, such as occurs in mammalian cells upon repeated exposure to the drug."

"25583362","abstracttext","Drought is a normal and recurring climate feature in most parts of the world and plays a major role in limiting crop productivity. However, plants have their own defence systems to cope with adverse climatic conditions. One of these defence mechanisms is the reprogramming of gene expression by microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are small noncoding RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides length, which have emerged as important regulators of genes at post-transcriptional levels in a range of organisms. Some miRNAs are functionally conserved across plant species and are regulated by drought stress. These properties suggest that miRNA-based genetic modifications have the potential to enhance drought tolerance in cereal crops. This review summarizes the current understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of plant miRNAs, involvement of plant miRNAs in drought stress responses in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), wheat (Triticum spp.) and other plant species, and the involvement of miRNAs in plant-adaptive mechanisms under drought stress. Potential strategies and directions for future miRNA research and the utilization of miRNAs in the improvement of cereal crops for drought tolerance are also discussed."

"25212239","abstracttext","A wheat (Triticum turgidum subsp. durum) mutant, generated with sodium azide from wild-type (WT) cv. 'Trinakria', differs in its water affinity of dry leaves, and was designated as a water-mutant. Compared with the WT, water-mutant leaves have lower rates of water uptake, while stomatal and cuticular transpiration do not differ. The nuclear magnetic resonance proton signals used for image reconstruction of leaf cross sections showed differences between these genotypes for the T1 proton spin-density and the T2 proton spin-spin relaxation time. Structural and histochemical analyses at midrib level showed that the water-mutant has thinner leaves, with more and smaller cells per unit area of mesophyll and sclerenchyma, and has altered staining patterns of lignin and pectin-like substances. Stress-strain curves to examine the rheological properties of the leaves showed a biphasic trend, which reveals that the tensile strength at break load and the elastic modulus of the second phase of the water-mutant are significantly higher than for the WT. These data support the proposal of interrelationships among local biophysical properties of the leaf, the microscopic water structure, the rheological properties and the water flux rate across the leaf. This water-mutant can be used for analysis of the genetic basis of these differences, and for identification of gene(s) that govern these traits."

"28568391","abstracttext","Migration patterns in wild emmer wheat, Triticum dicoccoides, were inferred from single-locus and multilocus genetic distributions based primarily on expectations derived from single-locus and multilocus cline theory. Populations from five collections displayed a large amount of multilocus structuring, as indicated by high values of gametic-phase disequilibrium between pairs of loci and by high values of multilocus associations. Analyses of the distributions of individual alleles, however, indicated that alleles had apparent independent centers of origin and that at least some independent dispersal within regions occupied by ecotypes or races of wild emmer had occurred. The distribution of the degrees of multilocus association suggests that there has been a net migration of the northern or Qazrin race south and west into the pocket occupied by the Yehudiyya race. The results suggest that ecotypic differentiation may be independent and may antedate electrophoretically determined differentiation in these populations. There is no convincing evidence that the multilocus associations represent coadapted complexes; rather they appear to involve associations of mutant alleles that have been accentuated and preserved by low recombination rates and gene-flow barriers within previously differentiated ecotypes."

Both processes can affect the transcription of homoeologues. Here, RNA-Seq was used to obtain the genome-wide leaf transcriptome of two independent Triticum turgidum × Aegilops tauschii allotriploids (F1), along with their spontaneous allohexaploids (S1) and their parental lines. The resulting sequence data were then used to characterize variation in homoeologue transcript abundance."
"28187716","abstracttext_results","The hybridization event strongly down-regulated D-subgenome homoeologues, but this effect was in many cases reversed by whole genome doubling. The suppression of D-subgenome homoeologue transcription resulted in a marked frequency of parental transcription level dominance, especially with respect to genes encoding proteins involved in photosynthesis. Singletons (genes where no homoeologues were present) were frequently transcribed at both the allotriploid and allohexaploid plants."

"33291583","abstracttext","Durum wheat ( Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum ) is a minor crop grown on about 17 million hectares of land worldwide. Several grain characteristics determine semolina's high end-use quality, such as grain protein content (GPC) which is directly related to the final products' nutritional and technological values. GPC improvement could be pursued by considering a candidate gene approach. The glutamine synthetase (GS)/glutamate synthase (GOGAT) cycle represents a bottleneck in the first step of nitrogen assimilation. QTL for GPC have been located on all chromosomes, and several major ones have been reported on 2A and 2B chromosomes, where GS2 and Fd-GOGAT genes have been mapped. A useful and efficient method to validate a putative QTL is the constitution of near-isogenic lines (NILs) by using the marker found to be associated to that QTL. Here, we present the development of two distinct sets of heterogeneous inbred family (HIF)- based NILs segregating for GS2 and Fd-GOGAT genes obtained from heterozygous lines at those loci, as well as their genotypic and phenotypic characterizations. The results allow the validation of the previously identified GPC QTL on 2A and 2B chromosomes, along with the role of these key genes in GPC control."

"26160336","abstracttext_key message","A novel powdery mildew resistance gene and a new allele of Pm1 were identified and fine mapped. DNA markers suitable for marker-assisted selection have been identified. Powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis is one of the most important foliar diseases of wheat and causes significant yield losses worldwide. Diploid A genome species are an important genetic resource for disease resistance genes. Two powdery mildew resistance genes, identified in Triticum boeoticum (A(b)A(b)) accession pau5088, PmTb7A.1 and PmTb7A.2 were mapped on chromosome 7AL. In the present study, shotgun sequence assembly data for chromosome 7AL were utilised for fine mapping of these Pm resistance genes. Forty SSR, 73 resistance gene analogue-based sequence-tagged sites (RGA-STS) and 36 single nucleotide polymorphism markers were designed for fine mapping of PmTb7A.1 and PmTb7A.2. Twenty-one RGA-STS, 8 SSR and 13 SNP markers were mapped to 7AL. RGA-STS markers Ta7AL-4556232 and 7AL-4426363 were linked to the PmTb7A.1 and PmTb7A.2, at a genetic distance of 0.6 and 6.0 cM, respectively. The present investigation established that PmTb7A.1 is a new powdery mildew resistance gene that confers resistance to a broad range of Bgt isolates, whereas PmTb7A.2 most probably is a new allele of Pm1 based on chromosomal location and screening with Bgt isolates showing differential reaction on lines with different Pm1 alleles. The markers identified to be linked to the two Pm resistance genes are robust and can be used for marker-assisted introgression of these genes to hexaploid wheat."
"12730378","articletitle","Positional cloning of the wheat vernalization gene VRN1."
"12730378","abstracttext","Winter wheats require several weeks at low temperature to flower. This process, vernalization, is controlled mainly by the VRN1 gene. Using 6,190 gametes, we found VRN1 to be completely linked to MADS-box genes AP1 and AGLG1 in a 0.03-centimorgan interval flanked by genes Cysteine and Cytochrome B5. No additional genes were found between the last two genes in the 324-kb Triticum monococcum sequence or in the colinear regions in rice and sorghum. Wheat AP1 and AGLG1 genes were similar to Arabidopsis meristem identity genes AP1 and AGL2, respectively. AP1 transcription was regulated by vernalization in both apices and leaves, and the progressive increase of AP1 transcription was consistent with the progressive effect of vernalization on flowering time. Vernalization was required for AP1 transcription in apices and leaves in winter wheat but not in spring wheat. AGLG1 transcripts were detected during spike differentiation but not in vernalized apices or leaves, suggesting that AP1 acts upstream of AGLG1. No differences were detected between genotypes with different VRN1 alleles in the AP1 and AGLG1 coding regions, but three independent deletions were found in the promoter region of AP1. These results suggest that AP1 is a better candidate for VRN1 than AGLG1. The epistatic interactions between vernalization genes VRN1 and VRN2 suggested a model in which VRN2 would repress directly or indirectly the expression of AP1. A mutation in the promoter region of AP1 would result in the lack of recognition of the repressor and in a dominant spring growth habit."

"18036635","abstracttext","Natural variation occurs in the uptake and distribution of essential and nonessential trace elements among crop species and among cultivars within species. Such variation can be responsible for trace element deficiencies and toxicities, which in turn can affect the quality of food. Plant breeding can be an important tool to both increase the concentration of desirable trace elements and reduce that of potentially harmful trace elements such as cadmium (Cd). Selection programs for a low-Cd content of various crops, including durum wheat, sunflower, rice and soybean have been established and low-Cd durum wheat cultivars and sunflower hybrids have been developed. In durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var durum), low-Cd concentration is controlled by a single dominant gene. The trait is highly heritable, and incorporation of the low-Cd allele can help to reduce the average grain Cd to levels below proposed international limits. The allele for low-Cd concentration does not appear to affect major economic traits and should not cause problems when incorporated into durum cultivars. The cost of Cd selection in a breeding program is initially large both in terms of Cd determination and reduced progress towards development of other economic traits, but declines as more breeding lines in the program carry the low-Cd trait and are utilized in new crosses. Production of low-Cd crop cultivars can be used as a tool to reduce the risk of movement of Cd into the human diet."

"20214384","abstracttext","We analyzed the accumulation of six phytohormones and phytohormone-related compounds in a wheat, Triticum aestivium L., genotype, 'Molly', after attacks by avirulent and virulent Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), larvae, respectively, and we examined the expression of genes in the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway by Northern blot analysis. Compared with uninfested plants, attacks by avirulent larvae resulted in increased accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) by 11.3- and 8.2-fold, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) by 36.4-and 18.7-fold, 18:3 fatty acid by 4.5- and 2.2-fold, and 18:1 fatty acid by 1.8- and 1.9-fold at 24 and 72 h post-initial attack (hpia), respectively, but an 20% decrease in JA accumulation at 24 hpia at the attack site. Attacks by the virulent larvae did not affect the accumulation of SA, OPDA, and 18:3 and 18:1 fatty acids but dramatically increased the concentration of auxin (AUX) from undetectable in uninfested plants to 381.7 ng/g fresh weight at 24 hpia and 71.0 ng/g fresh weight at 72 hpia in infested plants. Transcript levels of genes encoding lipoxygenase 2, allene oxide synthase, and Arabidopsis storage protein 2 were increased after avirulent larval attacks but decreased after virulent larval attacks. Our results suggest that OPDA and SA may act together in wheat resistance to the Hessian fly, whereas AUX may play a role in the susceptibility of wheat plants. The increased OPDA accumulation after avirulent larval attacks was at least partially regulated through gene transcription."
"20163557","articletitle","Pathogen race determines the type of resistance response in the stripe rust-Triticum dicoccoides pathosystem."
"20163557","abstracttext","Wild relatives of crop plants may serve as a promising source for screening for new disease resistance genes that can be utilized in breeding programs. Triticum dicoccoides, the wild progenitor of most cultivated wheats, was shown to harbor many resistance genes against the major diseases attacking cultivated wheat. Stripe rust is a devastating fungal disease that attacks wheat in many regions of the world. New races of Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici, the causative agent of stripe rust, have overcome most of the known Yr resistance genes in wheat. Therefore, there is a need to search for new resistance genes in the T. dicoccoides gene pool. A set of 120 T. dicoccoides accessions, collected from 13 populations representing different habitats in Israel and vicinity, was tested for resistance to three prevalent stripe rust races (38E134, 6E16 and 6E0). Of these 120 accessions, 14, 8 and 12% were resistant to races 38E134, 6E16 and 6E0, respectively, while 57, 2 and 4% were moderately resistant to these races, respectively. A unique resistance was found in the population of Mt Hermon where >80% of the accessions showed resistance to all races. Distribution of infection types (ITs) of race 38E134 showed a normal distribution that can fit a quantitative pattern of response, while the distributions of ITs of races 6E16 and 6E0 had excess of extreme values and therefore showing a qualitative pattern of response. anova testing the main factor effects and interaction showed significant effects of population, race and their interaction on IT. Significant positive correlations were obtained between the resistance to races 6E16 and 6E0 and humidity variables of the collections sites, while resistance to race 38E134 was positively correlated with temperature variables. These results show that the pathogen race can determine the type of resistance response, qualitative or quantitative, in the stripe rust-T. dicoccoides pathosystem. The obtained results also reveal that the distribution of resistance to different pathogen races can be affected by different climatic factors."

The ecological genomics of the wild progenitors of wheat and barley reviewed here was central in the research program of the Institute of Evolution, University of Haifa, since 1975 ( http://evolution.haifa.ac.il ). We explored the following questions: (1) How much of the genomic and phenomic diversity of wild progenitors of cultivars (wild emmer wheat, Triticum dicoccoides, the progenitor of most wheat, plus wild relatives of the Aegilops species; wild barley, Hordeum spontaneum, the progenitor of cultivated barley; wild oat, Avena sterilis, the progenitor of cultivated oats; and wild lettuce species, Lactuca, the progenitor and relatives of cultivated lettuce) are adaptive and processed by natural selection at both coding and noncoding genomic regions? (2) What is the origin and evolution of genomic adaptation and speciation processes and their regulation by mutation, recombination, and transposons under spatiotemporal variables and stressful macrogeographic and microgeographic environments? (3) How much genetic resources are harbored in the wild progenitors for crop improvement? We advanced ecological genetics into ecological genomics and analyzed (regionally across Israel and the entire Near East Fertile Crescent and locally at microsites, focusing on the ""Evolution Canyon"" model) hundreds of populations and thousands of genotypes for protein (allozyme) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (coding and noncoding) diversity, partly combined with phenotypic diversity. The environmental stresses analyzed included abiotic (climatic and microclimatic, edaphic) and biotic (pathogens, demographic) stresses. Recently, we introduced genetic maps, cloning, and transformation of candidate genes. Our results indicate abundant genotypic and phenotypic diversity in natural plant populations. The organization and evolution of molecular and organismal diversity in plant populations, at all genomic regions and geographical scales, are nonrandom and are positively correlated with, and partly predictable by, abiotic and biotic environmental heterogeneity and stress. Biodiversity evolution, even in small isolated populations, is primarily driven by natural selection including diversifying, balancing, cyclical, and purifying selection regimes interacting with, but, ultimately, overriding the effects of mutation, migration, and stochasticity. The progenitors of cultivated plants harbor rich genetic resources and are the best hope for crop improvement by both classical and modern biotechnological methods. Future studies should focus on the interplay between structural and functional genome organization focusing on gene regulation."

In order to determine its impact on drought tolerance in wheat, we characterized a pale-green durum wheat mutant (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) under contrasting water availability conditions."
"24521234","abstracttext_results","The pale-green mutant was investigated by comparing pigment content and gene/protein expression profiles to wild-type plants at anthesis. Under well-watered (control) conditions the mutant had lower levels of chlorophylls and carotenoids, but higher levels of xanthophyll de-epoxidation compared to wild-type. Transcriptomic analysis under control conditions showed that defense genes (encoding e.g. pathogenesis-related proteins, peroxidases and chitinases) were upregulated in the mutant, suggesting the presence of mild oxidative stress that was compensated without altering the net rate of photosynthesis. Transcriptomic analysis under terminal water stress conditions, revealed the modulation of antioxidant enzymes, photosystem components, and enzymes representing carbohydrate metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, indicating that the mutant was exposed to greater oxidative stress than the wild-type plants, but had a limited capacity to respond.

"30887094","articletitle","Evaluation of the genetic architecture and the potential of genomics-assisted breeding of quality traits in two large panels of durum wheat."
"30887094","abstracttext_key message","New QTL for important quality traits in durum were identified, but for most QTL their effect varies depending on the investigated germplasm. Most of the global durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) production is used for human consumption via pasta and to a lower extent couscous and bulgur. Therefore, durum wheat varieties have to fulfill high demands regarding quality traits. In this study, we evaluated the quality traits protein content, sedimentation volume, falling number, vitreousity and thousand kernel weight in a Central European (CP) and a Southern and Western European panel (SP) with 183 and 159 durum lines, respectively, and investigated their genetic architecture by genome-wide association mapping. Except for protein content, we identified QTL explaining a large proportion of the genotypic variance for different traits. However, most of them were identified only in one panel. Nevertheless, for sedimentation volume a genomic region on chromosome 1B appeared important in both durum panels and a BLAST search against the emmer and bread wheat reference genomes points toward the candidate gene Glu-B3. This was further supported by the protein subunit banding pattern via SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. For vitreousity, genomic regions on chromosome 7A explained a larger proportion of the genotypic variance in both panels, whereas one QTL, possibly related to the Pinb-2 locus, also slightly influenced the protein content. Within each panel, high prediction abilities for genomic selection were obtained, which, however, dropped considerably when predicting across both panels. Nevertheless, the across-panel prediction ability was still larger than 0.4 for protein content and sedimentation volume, underlining the potential for genomics-aided durum breeding, if laboratory and logistical facilities are available."
"31178873","articletitle","Differential Regulation of Stomatal Conductance as a Strategy to Cope With Ammonium Fertilizer Under Ambient Versus Elevated CO 2 ."
"31178873","abstracttext","While nitrogen (N) derived from ammonium would be energetically less expensive than nitrate-derived N, the use of ammonium-based fertilizer is limited by the potential for toxicity symptoms. Nevertheless, previous studies have shown that exposure to elevated CO 2 favors ammonium assimilation in plants. However, little is known about the impact of different forms of N fertilizer on stomatal opening and their consequent effects on CO 2 and H 2 O diffusion in wheat plants exposed to ambient and elevated CO 2 . In this article, we have examined the response of the photosynthetic machinery of durum wheat ( Triticum durum , var. Amilcar) grown with different types of N fertilizer (NO 3 - , NH 4 + , and NH 4 NO 3 ) at 400 versus 700 ppm of CO 2 . Alongside gas exchange and photochemical parameters, the expression of genes involved in CO 2 ( PIP1.1 and PIP2.3 ) and H 2 O ( TIP1 ) diffusion as well as key C and N primary metabolism enzymes and metabolites were studied. Our results show that at 400 ppm CO 2 , wheat plants fertilized with ammonium as the N source had stress symptoms and a strong reduction in stomatal conductance, which negatively affected photosynthetic rates. The higher levels of PIP1.1 and PIP2.3 expression in ammonium-fertilized plants at 400 ppm CO 2 might reflect the need to overcome limitations to the CO 2 supply to chloroplasts due to restrictions in stomatal conductance. This stomatal limitation might be associated with a strategy to reduce ammonium transport toward leaves. On the other hand, ammonium-fertilized plants at elevated CO 2 did not show stress symptoms, and no differences were detected in stomatal opening or water use efficiency (WUE). Moreover, similar gene expression of the aquaporins TIP1 , PIP1.1, and PIP2.3 in ammonium-fertilized plants grown at 700 ppm compared to nitrate and ammonium nitrate plants would suggest that an adjustment in CO 2 and H 2 O diffusion is not required. Therefore, in the absence of a stress context triggered by elevated CO 2 , ammonium- and ammonium nitrate-fertilized plants were able to increase their photosynthetic rates, which were translated eventually into higher leaf protein content."

"30643692","abstracttext","Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are the main components of the plant innate immune system. Defensins represent the most important AMP family involved in defense and non-defense functions. In this work, global RNA sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly were performed to explore the diversity of defensin-like (DEFL) genes in the wheat Triticum kiharae and to study their role in induced resistance (IR) mediated by the elicitor metabolites of a non-pathogenic strain FS-94 of Fusarium sambucinum . Using a combination of two pipelines for DEFL mining in transcriptome data sets, as many as 143 DEFL genes were identified in T. kiharae, the vast majority of them represent novel genes. According to the number of cysteine residues and the cysteine motif, wheat DEFLs were classified into ten groups. Classical defensins with a characteristic 8-Cys motif assigned to group 1 DEFLs represent the most abundant group comprising 52 family members. DEFLs with a characteristic 4-Cys motif CX{3,5}CX{8,17}CX{4,6}C named group 4 DEFLs previously found only in legumes were discovered in wheat. Within DEFL groups, subgroups of similar sequences originated by duplication events were isolated. Variation among DEFLs within subgroups is due to amino acid substitutions and insertions/deletions of amino acid sequences. To identify IR-related DEFL genes, transcriptional changes in DEFL gene expression during elicitor-mediated IR were monitored. Transcriptional diversity of DEFL genes in wheat seedlings in response to the fungus Fusarium oxysporum , FS-94 elicitors, and the combination of both (elicitors + fungus) was demonstrated, with specific sets of up- and down-regulated DEFL genes. DEFL expression profiling allowed us to gain insight into the mode of action of the elicitors from F. sambucinum. We discovered that the elicitors up-regulated a set of 24 DEFL genes. After challenge inoculation with F. oxysporum , another set of 22 DEFLs showed enhanced expression in IR-displaying seedlings. These DEFLs, in concert with other defense molecules, are suggested to determine enhanced resistance of elicitor-pretreated wheat seedlings. In addition to providing a better understanding of the mode of action of the elicitors from FS-94 in controlling diseases, up-regulated IR-specific DEFL genes represent novel candidates for genetic transformation of plants and development of pathogen-resistant crops."

"24243206","abstracttext","Since its first invention in the late 1980s the particle gun has evolved from a basic gunpowder driven machine firing tungsten particles to one more refined which uses helium gas as the propellant to launch alternative heavy metal particles such as gold and silver. The simple principle is that DNA-coated microscopic particles (microcarriers) are accelerated at high speed by helium gas within a vacuum and travel at such a velocity as to penetrate target cells. However, the process itself involves a range of parameters which are open to variation: microparticle type and size, gun settings (rupture pressure, target distance, vacuum drawn, etc.), preparation of components (e.g., gold coating), and preparation of plant tissues. Here is presented a method optimized for transformation of wheat immature embryos using the Bio-Rad PDS-1000/He particle gun to deliver gold particles coated with a gene of interest and the selectable marker gene bar at 650 psi rupture pressure. Following bombardment, various tissue culture phases are used to encourage embryogenic callus formation and regeneration of plantlets and subsequent selection using glufosinate ammonium causes suppression of non-transformed tissues, thus assisting the detection of transformed plants. This protocol has been used successfully to generate transgenic plants for a wide range of wheat varieties, both spring and winter bread wheats (T. aestivum L.) and durum wheats (T. turgidum L.)."

"32397492","abstracttext","Tetraploid species T. dicoccum Shuebl is a potential source of drought tolerance for cultivated wheat, including common wheat. This paper describes the genotyping of nine stable allolines isolated in the offspring from crossing of T. dicoccum x T. aestivum L. using 21 microsatellite (simple sequence repeats-SSR) markers and two cytoplasmic mitochondrial markers to orf256, rps19-p genes; evaluation of drought tolerance of allolines at different stages of ontogenesis (growth parameters, relative water content, quantum efficiency of Photosystem II, electron transport rate, energy dissipated in Photosystem II); and the study of drought tolerance regulator gene Dreb-1 with allele-specific PCR (AS-MARKER) and partial sequence analysis. Most allolines differ in genomic composition and T. dicoccum introgressions. Four allolines-D-b-05, D-d-05, D-d-05b, and D-41-05-revealed signs of drought tolerance of varying degrees. The more drought tolerant D-41-05 line was also characterized by Dreb-B1 allele introgression from T. dicoccum . A number of non-specific patterns and significant differences in allolines in regulation of physiological parameters in drought conditions is identified. Changes in photosynthetic activity in stress-drought are shown to reflect the level of drought tolerance of the forms studied. The contribution of different combinations of nuclear/cytoplasmic genome and alleles of Dreb-1 gene in allolines to the formation of stress tolerance and photosynthetic activity is discussed."

"30786499","abstracttext","Stem rust resistance in wheat cultivars with Sr31 has been effective and durable worldwide for more than 30 years. Isolates of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici with virulence to Sr31 were detected in Uganda in 1999 (1). During 2003 and 2004, a majority of current Kenyan cultivars and a large portion of CIMMYT wheat germplasm with gene Sr31 planted in Kenya were susceptible to stem rust. Six isolates collected during 2004 at different locations in Kenya were tested for virulence on the 16 North American stem rust race differentials with the following Sr genes: Sr5, 6, 7b, 8a, 9a, 9b, 9d, 9e, 9g, 10, 11, 17, 21, 30, 36, and Tmp. An extended set of designated Sr genes (Sr13, 19, 22, 24, 25, 26, 29, 31, 32, 33, 35, 37, 39, 40, 44, and Wld-1) was also tested at the seedling stage. An isolate from Uganda collected in 1999 with virulence on Sr31 was used for comparison. Urediniospores suspended in a lightweight mineral oil were inoculated onto 7-day-old seedlings. Inoculated plants were placed in a dew chamber for 14 h at 18°C in the dark and then for an additional period of 3 to 4 h placed under fluorescent light. Plants were incubated in a greenhouse at 18 ± 2°C with a photoperiod of 16 h. Infection types (IT), described by Stakman et al. (3), were assessed after 14 days postinoculation. All isolates from Kenya exhibited a low infection type (IT 0) on line W2691SrTt-1 (donor of Sr36), a low infection type (IT 2) on cv. Triumph 64 (donor of SrTmp), and high infection types (IT 3 or 4) on all other lines in the differential set (2); thus these isolates were keyed to race TTKS. The virulence pattern of the isolate collected in 1999 from Uganda was identical to that from Kenya on the differential set and on the extended set of designated Sr genes. In this study, these isolates produced a high infection type (IT 3) on Einkorn and CnSSr21Tm (a derivative of Triticum monococcum in Chinese Spring background), two sources of Sr21 used in our study, whereas the isolate with Sr31-virulence from Uganda in 1999 was reported to be avirulent on Sr21 (1). These isolates produced high infection types on single gene lines with Sr31 and winter wheat cvs. Custer, Foster, GA-Dozier, Patton, and Pioneer 26R61, which were known to carry the 1BL.1RS translocation with Sr31. These isolates were also virulent on SrWld-1, a gene used in spring wheat for its resistance to North American stem rust isolates. In addition to Sr36 and SrTmp, other stem rust resistance genes that were effective against TTKS at the seedling stage include Sr13, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 32, 33, 35, 37, 39, 40, and 44. Cultivars, breeding germplasm, and single gene lines are currently being evaluated for adult plant reaction in Kenya. Results from this study indicated that stem rust isolates with virulence on Sr31 are now wide spread in the Eastern Africa highlands and pose a threat to wheat production in the region, as well as in other wheat production areas where Sr31 resistance is important. A rapid deployment of effective resistance genes to this race in breeding programs throughout Eastern Africa and Asia is needed to reduce this threat. References: (1) Z. A. Pretorius et al.

"20127492","abstracttext","Retrotransposons constitute a major proportion of the Triticeae genomes. Genome-scale studies have revealed their role in evolution affecting both genome structure and function and their potential for the development of novel markers. In this study, family members of an LTR copia retrotransposon which mediated the duplication of the gene encoding the high molecular weight glutenin subunit Bx7 in cultivar Glenlea were characterized. This novel element was named Sasanda_EU157184-1 (TREP3516). High density filters of the Glenlea hexaploid wheat BAC library were screened with a Sasanda long terminal repeat (LTR)-specific probe and approximately 1,075 positive clones representing an estimated copy number of 347 elements per haploid genome were identified. The 242 BAC clones with the strongest hybridization signal were selected. To maximize isolation of complete elements, this subset of clones was screened with a reverse transcriptase (RT) domain probe and DNA was isolated from the 133 clones that produced a strong hybridization signal. Left (5') and right (3') LTRs as well as the RT domains were PCR amplified and sequencing was carried out on the final subset of 121 clones. Evolutionary relationships were inferred from a data set consisting of 100 RT, 102 5' LTR and 100 3' LTR sequences representing 233, 451 and 495 informative sites for comparison, respectively. Neighbour-joining tree indicated that the element is at least 1.8 million years old and has evolved into a minimum of five sub-families. The insertion times of the 89 complete elements were estimated based on the divergence between their LTRs. Corroborating the inference from the RT domain, analysis of the LTR domains also indicated bursts of amplification from 2.6 million years ago (MYA) to now, except for one member dated to 4.6 +/- 0.7 MYA, which corresponds to the interval of divergence of Triticum and Aegilops (3 MYA) and divergence of Triticum and Rye (7 MYA). In 44 elements, the 5' and 3' LTRs were identical indicating recent transposition activity. The element can be used to develop retrotransposon-based markers such as sequence-specific amplified polymorphism, retrotransposon microsatellite amplified polymorphism and inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism, all of which are well suited for genotyping studies."

"25886913","abstracttext_background","One of the most important evolutionary processes in plants is polyploidization. The combination of two or more genomes in one organism often initially leads to changes in gene expression and extensive genomic reorganization, compared to the parental species. Hexaploid triticale (x Triticosecale) is a synthetic hybrid crop species generated by crosses between T. turgidum and Secale cereale. Because triticale is a recent synthetic polyploid it is an important model for studying genome evolution following polyploidization. Molecular studies have demonstrated that genomic sequence changes, consisting of sequence elimination or loss of expression of genes from the rye genome, are common in triticale. High-throughput DNA sequencing allows a large number of genes to be surveyed, and transcripts from the different homeologous copies of the genes that have high sequence similarity can be better distinguished than hybridization methods previously employed."

Comparisons between diploid rye and hexaploid triticale detected 112 rye cDNA contigs (~0.5%) that were totally undetected by expression analysis in all triticale tissues, although their expression was relatively high in rye tissues. Non-expressed rye genes were found to be strikingly less similar to their closest BLASTN matches in the wheat genome or in the other Triticum genomes than a test set of 200 random rye genes. Genes that were not detected in the RNA-seq data were further characterized by testing for their presence in the triticale genome by PCR using genomic DNA as a template."

"31639249","abstracttext","Crop wild relatives are fundamental genetic resources for crop improvement. Wheat wild relatives often produce heteromorphic seeds that differ in morphological and physiological traits. Several Aegilops and Triticum species possess, within the same spikelet, a dimorphic seed pair, with one seed being larger than the other. A comprehensive analysis is needed to understand which traits are involved in seed dimorphism and if these aspects of variation in dimorphic pairs are functionally related. To this end, dispersal units of Triticum urartu and five Aegilops species were X-rayed and the different seed morphs weighed. Germination tests were carried out on seeds, both dehulled and left in their dispersal units. Controlled ageing tests were performed to detect differences in seed longevity among seed morphs, and the antioxidant profile was assessed in terms of antioxidant compounds equipment and expression of selected antioxidant genes. We used PCA to group seed morphs sharing similar patterns of germination traits, longevity estimates and antioxidant profile. Different seed morphs differed significantly in terms of mass, final germination, germination timing, longevity estimates and antioxidant profile in most of the tested species. Small seeds germinated slower, had lower germination when left in their dispersal units, a higher antioxidant potential and were longer-lived than large seeds. The antioxidant gene expression varied between morphs, with different patterns across species but not clearly reflecting the phenotypic observations. The results highlight different trait trade-offs in dimorphic seeds of Aegilops and T. urartu, affecting their germination phenology and longevity, thereby resulting in recruitment niche differentiation."

B73, allowed us to examine the organization of chloroplast SSRs (cpSSRs) in genic and intergenic regions. We identified 204 cpSSRs in the sugarcane cpDNA; 22.5% were in genic regions. The ndh, rps, trn, and rpl gene clusters of the chloroplasts had the most repeats. Mononucleotide repeats were the most abundant cpSSRs in these species; however, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotide repeats were also identified. Many base substitutions and deletions/insertions were identified in the cpSSR loci and their flanking regions. Multiple alignments of all cpSSR sequences of Poaceae species made identification of nucleotide variability possible; repeat motifs are not uniformly distributed across the Poaceae plastomes, but are mostly confined to intergenic regions. Phylogeny was determined by maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining inference methods. The cpSSRs of these species were found to be polymorphic. It appears that individual cpSSRs in the Poaceae are stable, at least over short periods of evolutionary time. We conclude that the plastome database can be exploited for phylogenetic analysis and biotechnological development."

"24188189","abstracttext","Triticum aestivum aluminum-activated malate transporter (TaALMT1) is the founding member of a unique gene family of anion transporters (ALMTs) that mediate the efflux of organic acids. A small sub-group of root-localized ALMTs, including TaALMT1, is physiologically associated with in planta aluminum (Al) resistance. TaALMT1 exhibits significant enhancement of transport activity in response to extracellular Al. In this study, we integrated structure-function analyses of structurally altered TaALMT1 proteins expressed in Xenopus oocytes with phylogenic analyses of the ALMT family. Our aim is to re-examine the role of protein domains in terms of their potential involvement in the Al-dependent enhancement (i.e. Al-responsiveness) of TaALMT1 transport activity, as well as the roles of all its 43 negatively charged amino acid residues. Our results indicate that the N-domain, which is predicted to form the conductive pathway, mediates ion transport even in the absence of the C-domain. However, segments in both domains are involved in Al(3+) sensing. We identified two regions, one at the N-terminus and a hydrophobic region at the C-terminus, that jointly contribute to the Al-response phenotype. Interestingly, the characteristic motif at the N-terminus appears to be specific for Al-responsive ALMTs. Our study highlights the need to include a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis when drawing inferences from structure-function analyses, as a significant proportion of the functional changes observed for TaALMT1 are most likely the result of alterations in the overall structural integrity of ALMT family proteins rather than modifications of specific sites involved in Al(3+) sensing."

Effect of various parameters on bioreactor performance was examined and optimum removal was observed at optical density (OD600 nm): 0.8; pH: 7.2; CP concentration: 300 mg L(-1) and hydraulic retention time: 48 h. At optimum conditions, 70.3/79% of CP/chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal was achieved in batch bioreactors. In addition, P. alimentarius T14 achieved 95/91, 62.3/75, 69.8/64% CP/COD removal efficiency with addition of CS (co-substrates), CS1 (yeast extract + synthetic wastewater), CS2 (glucose + synthetic wastewater) and CS3 (yeast extract), respectively. Addition of CS1 to bioreactor could accelerate CP removal rate up to many cycles with considerable efficiency. However, accumulation of 3, 5, 6-trichloro-2-pyridinol affects reactor performance in cyclic mode. First-order rate constant k1 0.062 h(-1) and t1/2 11.1 h demonstrates fast degradation.

"26183462","abstracttext","Sugarcane is an ideal candidate for biofarming applications because of its large biomass, rapid growth rate, efficient carbon fixation pathway and a well-developed storage tissue system. Vacuoles occupy a large proportion of the storage parenchyma cells in the sugarcane stem, and the stored products can be harvested as juice by crushing the cane. Hence, for the production of any high-value protein, it could be targeted to the lytic vacuoles so as to extract and purify the protein of interest from the juice. There is no consensus vacuolar-targeting sequence so far to target any heterologous proteins to sugarcane vacuole. Hence, in this study, we identified an N-terminal 78-bp-long putative vacuolar-targeting sequence from the N-terminal domain of unknown function (DUF) in Triticum aestivum 6-SFT (sucrose: fructan 6-fructosyl transferase). In this study, we have generated sugarcane transgenics with gene coding for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused with the vacuolar-targeting determinants at the N-terminal driven by a strong constitutive promoter (Port ubi882) and demonstrated the targeting of GFP to the vacuoles. In addition, we have also generated transgenics with His-tagged β-glucuronidase (GUS) and aprotinin targeted to the lytic vacuole, and these two proteins were isolated and purified from the transgenic sugarcane and compared with commercially available protein samples. Our studies have demonstrated that the novel vacuolar-targeting determinant could localize recombinant proteins (r-proteins) to the vacuole in high concentrations and such targeted r-proteins can be purified from the juice with a few simple steps."

These strains degraded n-alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) aerobically from heavy crude oil (HCO) in an experiment at 37 °C and 140 rpm. The GC/MS investigation for degradation of different chain lengths of n-alkanes (C8-C40) by individual strains showed the highest degradation of C8-C19 (HRJ5), C20-C30 (HRJ4) and C31-C40 (HRJ5), respectively. Moreover, degradation of 16 PAHs with individual strains demonstrated that the bicyclic and pentacyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (AHs) were mostly degraded by HRJ5, tricyclic and tetracyclic AHs by HRJ6 and hexacyclic AHs by HRJ2. However, the highest degradation of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs), total saturated hydrocarbons (TSH), total aromatic hydrocarbons (TAH), n-alkanes (C8-C40) and 16 PAHs was achieved by a four-membered consortium (HRJ2 + 4 + 5 + 6) within 12 days, with the predominance of HRJ4 and HRJ6 strains which was confirmed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.

"32481013","abstracttext","Genomic retrotransposons (RTs) are major components of most plant genomes. They spread throughout the genomes by a process termed retrotransposition, which consists of reverse transcription and reinsertion of the copied element into a new genomic location (a copy-and-paste system). Abiotic and biotic stresses activate long-terminal repeat (LTR) RTs in photosynthetic eukaryotes from algae to angiosperms. LTR RTs could represent a threat to the integrity of host genomes because of their activity and mutagenic potential by epigenetic regulation. Host genomes have developed mechanisms to control the activity of the retroelements and their mutagenic potential. Some LTR RTs escape these defense mechanisms, and maintain their ability to be activated and transpose as a result of biotic or abiotic stress stimuli. These stimuli include pathogen infection, mechanical damage, in vitro tissue culturing, heat, drought and salt stress, generation of doubled haploids, X-ray irradiation and many others. Reactivation of LTR RTs differs between different plant genomes. The expression levels of reactivated RTs are influenced by the transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanisms (e.g. DNA methylation, heterochromatin formation and RNA interference). Moreover, the insertion of RTs (e.g. Triticum aestivum L. Wis2-1A) into or next to coding regions of the host genome can generate changes in the expression of adjacent host genes of the host. In this paper, we review the ways that plant genomic LTR RTs are activated by environmental stimuli to affect restructuring and diversification of the host genome."

"30669974","abstracttext_background","Chloroplasts are one of the most indispensable organelles that make life forms on the earth possible by their capacity to photosynthesize. These organelles possess a circular genome with a number of coding genes responsible for self-regulation. tRNAs are an important evolutionary-conserved gene family that are responsible for protein translation. However, within the chloroplast genome, tRNA machinery are poorly understood."
"30669974","abstracttext_results","In the present study, the chloroplast genome of six monocot plants, Oryza nivara (NC_005973), Oryza sativa (NC_001320), Sachharum officinarum (NC_006084), Sorghum bicolor (NC_008602), Triticum aestivum (NC_002762), and Zea mays (NC_001666) were downloaded and analyzed to identify tRNA sequences. Further analysis of the tRNA sequences in the chloroplast genomes of the monocot plants resulted in the identification of several novel features. The length of tRNAs in the chloroplast genome of the monocot plants ranged from 59 to 155 nucleotides. Pair-wise sequence alignment revealed the presence of a conserved A-C-x-U-A-x-U-A-x-U-x 5 -U-A-A nucleotide consensus sequence. In addition, the tRNAs in chloroplast genomes of the monocot plants also contain 21-28 anti-codons against 61 sense codons in the genome. They also contain a group I intron and a C-A-U anti-codon for tRNA Ile , which is a common anti-codon of tRNA Met . Evolutionary analysis indicates that tRNAs in the chloroplast genome have evolved from multiple common ancestors, and tRNA Met appears to be the ancestral tRNA that underwent duplication and diversification to give rise to other tRNAs."
"30669974","abstracttext_conclusion","The results obtained from the study of chloroplast tRNA will greatly help to increase our understanding of tRNA biology at a new level. Functional studies of the reported novel aspects of the chloroplast tRNA of the monocot plants will greatly help to decipher their roles in diverse cellular processes."

"30370195","abstracttext","With the continuous increase in the population of developing countries and decline of natural resources, there is an urgent need to qualitatively and quantitatively augment crop productivity by using new tools and technologies for improvement of agriculturally important traits. The new scientific and technological omics-based approaches have enabled us to deal with several issues and challenges faced by modern agricultural system and provided us novel opportunities for ensuring food and nutritional security. Recent developments in sequencing techniques have made available huge amount of genomic and transcriptomic data on model and cultivated crop plants including Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Triticum aestivum etc. The sequencing data along with other data generated through several omics platforms have significantly influenced the disciplines of crop sciences. Gene discovery and expression profiling-based technologies are offering enormous opportunities to the scientific community which can now apply marker-assisted selection technology to assess and enhance diversity in their collected germplasm, introgress essential traits from new sources and investigate genes that control key traits of crop plants. Utilization of omics science and technologies for crop productivity, protection and management has recently been receiving a lot of attention; the majority of the efforts have been put into signifying the possible applications of various omics technologies in crop plant sciences. This article highlights the background of challenges and opportunities for augmentation of crop productivity through interventions of omics technologies in India."

"30103700","abstracttext_background","Nitrate (NO 3 - ) is the major source of nitrogen (N) for higher plants aside from its function in transducing the N signaling. Improving N use efficiency of crops has been an effective strategy for promotion of the sustainable agriculture worldwide. The regulatory pathways associating with N uptake and the corresponding biochemical processes impact largely on plant N starvation tolerance. Thus, exploration of the molecular mechanism underlying nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and the gene wealth will pave a way for molecular breeding of N starvation-tolerant crop cultivars."
"30103700","abstracttext_results","In the current study, we characterized the function of TaNBP1, a guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta gene of wheat (T. aestivum), in mediating the plant N starvation response. TaNBP1 protein harbors a conserved W40 domain and the TaNBP1-GFP (green fluorescence protein) signals concentrate at positions of cytoplasm membrane and cytosol. TaNBP1 transcripts are induced in roots and leaves upon N starvation stress and that this upregulated expression is recovered by N recovery treatment. TaNBP1 overexpression confers improved phenotype, enlarged root system architecture (RSA), and increased biomass for plants upon N deprivation relative to the wild type, associating with its role in enhancing N accumulation and improving reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. Nitrate transporter (NRT) gene NtNRT2.2 and antioxidant enzyme genes NtSOD1, NtSOD2, and NtCAT1 are transcriptionally regulated under TaNBP1 and contribute to the improved N acquisition and the increased AE activities of plants."
"30103700","abstracttext_conclusions","Altogether, TaNBP1 is transcriptional response to N starvation stress. Overexpression of this gene enhances plant N starvation adaptation via improvement of N uptake and cellular ROS homeostasis by modifying transcription of NRT gene NtNRT2.2 and antioxidant enzyme genes NtSOD1, NtSOD2, and NtCAT1, respectively. Our research helps to understand the mechanism underlying plant N starvation response and benefits to genetically engineer crop cultivars with improved NUE under the N-saving cultivation conditions."

"15164175","abstracttext","This paper reports the characterization of the low-molecular-weight (LMW) glutenin gene family of Aegilops tauschii (syn. Triticum tauschii), the D-genome donor of hexaploid wheat. By analysis of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones positive for hybridization with an LMW glutenin probe, seven unique LMW glutenin genes were identified. These genes were sequenced, including their untranslated 3' and 5' flanking regions. The deduced amino acid sequences of the genes revealed four putative active genes and three pseudogenes. All these genes had a very high level of similarity to LMW glutenins characterized in hexaploid wheat. The predicted molecular weights of the mature proteins were between 32.2 kDa and 39.6 kDa, and the predicted isoelectric points of the proteins were between 7.53 and 8.06. All the deduced proteins were of the LMW-m type. The organization of the seven LMW glutenin genes appears to be interspersed over at least several hundred kilo base pairs, as indicated by the presence of only one gene or pseudogene per BAC clone. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA of Ae. tauschii and the BAC clones containing the seven LMW glutenin genes indicated that the BAC clones contained all LMW glutenin-hybridizing bands present in the genome. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of an LMW glutenin extract from Ae. tauschii was conducted and showed the presence of at least 11 distinct proteins. Further analysis indicated that some of the observed proteins were modified gliadins. These results suggest that the actual number of typical LMW glutenins may in fact be much lower than previously thought, with a number of modified gliadins also being present in the polymeric fraction."

"17046593","abstracttext","Understanding the molecular structure of high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) may provide useful evidence for the study on the improvement of quality of cultivated wheat and the evolution of Glu-1 alleles. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) shows that the subunits encoded by Glu-B1 were null, named 1Bxm, in a Triticum turgidum var. dicoccoides line PI94640. Primers based on the conserved regions in wheat HMW-GS gene promoter and coding sequences were used to amplify the genomic DNA of line PI94640. The PCR products were sequenced, and the total nucleotide sequence of 3,442 bp including upstream sequence of 1,070 bp was obtained. Compared with the reported gene sequences of Glu-1Bx alleles, the promoter region of the Glu-1Bxm showed close resemblance to 1Bx7. The Glu-1Bxm coding region differs from the other Glu-1Bx alleles for a deduced mature protein with only 212 residues, and a stop codon (TAA) at 637 bp downstream from the start codon was present, which was probably responsible for the silencing of x-type subunit genes at the Glu-B1 locus. Phylogenetic tree based on the nucleotide sequence alignment of HMW glutenin subunit genes showed that 1Bxm was the most ancient type of Glu-B1 alleles, suggesting that the evolution rates are different among Glu-1Bx genes. Further study on the contribution of the unique silenced Glu-B1 alleles to quality improvement was also discussed."

"21408015","articletitle","Transcriptome analysis of the vernalization response in barley (Hordeum vulgare) seedlings."
"21408015","abstracttext","Temperate cereals, such as wheat (Triticum spp.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare), respond to prolonged cold by becoming more tolerant of freezing (cold acclimation) and by becoming competent to flower (vernalization). These responses occur concomitantly during winter, but vernalization continues to influence development during spring. Previous studies identified VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1) as a master regulator of the vernalization response in cereals. The extent to which other genes contribute to this process is unclear. In this study the Barley1 Affymetrix chip was used to assay gene expression in barley seedlings during short or prolonged cold treatment. Gene expression was also assayed in the leaves of plants after prolonged cold treatment, in order to identify genes that show lasting responses to prolonged cold, which might contribute to vernalization-induced flowering. Many genes showed altered expression in response to short or prolonged cold treatment, but these responses differed markedly. A limited number of genes showed lasting responses to prolonged cold treatment. These include genes known to be regulated by vernalization, such as VRN1 and ODDSOC2, and also contigs encoding a calcium binding protein, 23-KD jasmonate induced proteins, an RNase S-like protein, a PR17d secretory protein and a serine acetyltransferase. Some contigs that were up-regulated by short term cold also showed lasting changes in expression after prolonged cold treatment. These include COLD REGULATED 14B (COR14B) and the barley homologue of WHEAT COLD SPECIFIC 19 (WSC19), which were expressed at elevated levels after prolonged cold. Conversely, two C-REPEAT BINDING FACTOR (CBF) genes showed reduced expression after prolonged cold. Overall, these data show that a limited number of barley genes exhibit lasting changes in expression after prolonged cold treatment, highlighting the central role of VRN1 in the vernalization response in cereals."

"25888295","abstracttext_background","In order to clarify the origin of spring growth habit in modern domesticated wheat, allelic variability of the VRN-1 gene was investigated in a wide set of accessions of the wild tetraploid species Triticum dicoccoides (BBAA), together with diploid species T. monococcum, T. boeoticum and T. urartu, presumable donors of the A genome to polyploid wheats."
"25888295","abstracttext_results","No significant variation was found at the VRN-B1 locus of T. dicoccoides, whereas at VRN-A1 a number of previously described alleles were found with small deletions in the promoter (VRN-A1b, VRN-A1d) or a large deletion in the first (1st) intron (VRN-A1L). The diploid A genome species were characterized by their own set of VRN-1 alleles including previously described VRN-A1f and VRN-A1h alleles with deletions in the promoter region and the VRN-A1ins allele containing a 0.5 kb insertion in the 1st intron. Based on the CAPS screening data, alleles VRN-A1f and VRN-A1ins were species-specific for T. monococcum, while allele VRN-A1h was specific for T. boeoticum. Different indels were revealed in both the promoter and 1(st) intron of the recessive VRN-A1u allele providing specific identification of T. urartu, the proposed donor of the A genome to modern wheat. We found that alleles VRN-A1b and VRN-A1h, previously described as dominant, have either no or weak association with spring growth habit, while in some diploid accessions this habit was associated with the recessive VRN-A1 allele."
"25888295","abstracttext_conclusions","Spring growth habit in diploid wheats was only partially associated with indels in regulatory regions of the VRN-1 gene. An exception is T. monococcum where dominant mutations in both the promoter region and, especially, the 1st intron were selected during domestication resulting in a greater variety of spring forms. The wild tetraploid T. dicoccoides had a distinct set of VRN-A1 alleles compared to the diploids in this study, indicating an independent origin of spring tetraploid forms that likely occurred after combining of diploid genomes. These alleles were subsequently inherited by cultivated polyploid (tetraploid and hexaploid) descendants."

"33114422","abstracttext","Wheat is the most widely grown crop and represents the staple food for one third of the world's population. Wheat is attacked by a large variety of pathogens and the use of resistant cultivars is an effective and environmentally safe strategy for controlling diseases and eliminating the use of fungicides. In this study, a collection of wild and cultivated tetraploid wheats ( Triticum turgidum) were evaluated for seedling resistance (SR) and adult plant resistance (APR) to powdery mildew ( Blumeria graminis ) and genotyped with a 90K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array to identify new sources of resistance genes. The genome-wide association mapping detected 18 quantitative trait loci (QTL) for APR and 8 QTL for SR, four of which were identical or at least closely linked to four QTL for APR. Thirteen candidate genes, containing nucleotide binding sites and leucine-rich repeats, were localized in the confidence intervals of the QTL-tagging SNPs. The marker IWB6155, associated to QPm.mgb-1AS, was located within the gene TRITD1Av1G004560 coding for a disease resistance protein. While most of the identified QTL were described previously, five QTL for APR (QPm.mgb-1AS, QPm.mgb-2BS, QPm.mgb-3BL.1, QPm.mgb-4BL, QPm.mgb-7BS.1) and three QTL for SR ( QPm.mgb-3BL.3, QPm.mgb-5AL.2, QPm.mgb-7BS.2 ) were mapped on chromosome regions where no resistance gene was reported before. The novel QTL/genes can contribute to enriching the resistance sources available to breeders."

"32648010","abstracttext_key message","Wheat MAPK gene TaMPK14 is N starvation response and is crucial in modulating plant low-N stress tolerance. Improving plant N use efficiency (NUE) contributes largely to the sustainable crop production worldwide. In this study, TaMPK14, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family gene in T. aestivum, was characterized for the role in mediating N starvation response. TaMPK14 harbors conserved domain/motifs specified by the plant MAPK proteins. In vitro assay for kinase activity of TaMPK14 validated its phosphorylation nature. TaMPK14 transcripts were upregulated in both roots and leaves under low-N treatment; moreover, the expression levels induced by N starvation were gradually restored following the N recovery progression. These results suggested transcriptional response of TaMPK14 upon the low-N stress. Compared with wild type (WT), the TaMPK14 overexpressing lines in N. tabacum displayed improved growth and N accumulation traits under deficient-N treatment, which indicated the crucial roles of the MAPK gene in mediating N starvation response. Additionally, the lines treated by N starvation were shown to be improved on cellular ROS homeostasis, displaying higher antioxidant enzymes (AE) activities and less ROS accumulative amount than WT. The transcripts of nitrate transporter gene NtNRT2.1 and those of AE genes NtSOD1, NtCAT1;2, and NtPOD4 were significantly upregulated in N-deprived TaMPK14 lines; overexpression of them conferred plants enhanced N uptake capacity and AE activities, respectively. Moreover, RNA-seq datasets generated from N-deprived transgenic lines contained numerous differential genes involving modulating various biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. Together, our investigation suggested that TaMPK14 improves plant N starvation response through transcriptional regulation of distinct NRT and AE genes as well as modulation of associated biological processes."

In di-, tetra- and hexaploid wheats the presence of a dominant allele of at least one VRN1 gene homologue (Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1, Vrn-G1 or Vrn-D1) determines the spring growth habit. Allelic variation between the Vrn-1 and vrn-1 alleles relies on mutations in the promoter region or the first intron. The origin and variability of the dominant VRN1 alleles, determining the spring growth habit in tetraploid wheat species have been poorly studied."
"28105956","abstracttext_results","Here we analyzed the growth habit of 228 tetraploid wheat species accessions and 25 % of them were spring type. We analyzed the promoter and first intron regions of VRN1 genes in 57 spring accessions of tetraploid wheats. The spring growth habit of most studied spring accessions was determined by previously identified dominant alleles of VRN1 genes. Genetic experiments proof the dominant inheritance of Vrn-A1d allele which was widely distributed across the accessions of Triticum dicoccoides. Two novel alleles were discovered and designated as Vrn-A1b.7 and Vrn-B1dic. Vrn-A1b.7 had deletions of 20 bp located 137 bp upstream of the start codon and mutations within the VRN-box when compared to the recessive allele of vrn-A1. So far the Vrn-A1d allele was identified only in spring accessions of the T. dicoccoides and T. turgidum species. Vrn-B1dic was identified in T. dicoccoides IG46225 and had 11 % sequence dissimilarity in comparison to the promoter of vrn-B1.

"29947952","abstracttext_key message","Wheat miRNA member TaMIR1139 targets genes functional in various families and plays crucial roles in regulating plant Pi starvation tolerance. Through regulating target genes at posttranscriptional or translational level, plant miRNAs are involved in mediating diverse biological processes associated with growth, development, and responses to adverse stresses. In this study, we characterized the expression pattern and function of TaMIR1139, a miRNA member of wheat (T. aestivum) under Pi deprivation. TaMIR1139 precursor is also present in N. tabucum, suggesting the conserved nature of miR1139 across monocots and eudicots. TaMIR1139 targets seven genes within different families. The transcripts abundance of TaMIR1139 was induced upon Pi deprivation and the upregulated expression under Pi starvation was downregulated by the Pi recovery treatment, In contrast, the genes targeted by TaMIR1139 exhibited reduced transcripts upon Pi starvation and their downregulated expression was recovered by Pi-recovery condition, suggesting the regulation of them under TaMIR1139 through a cleavage mechanism. TaMIR1139 overexpression conferred the Pi-deprived plants improved phenotype, biomass, photosynthesis, and Pi acquisition. Transcriptome analysis identified numerous genes involving biological process, cellular components, and molecular function were differentially expressed in the TaMIR1139 overexpression lines, which suggests the TaMIR1139-mediated plant Pi starvation tolerance to be associated with the role of miRNA in extensively modulating the transcript profiling. A phosphate transporter (PT) gene NtPT showed significantly upregulated expression in TaMIR1139 overexpression lines; overexpression of it conferred plants improved Pi acquisition upon Pi starvation, suggesting its contribution to the TaMIR1139-mediated plant low-Pi stress resistance. Our investigation indicates that TaMIR1139 is critical in plant Pi starvation tolerance through transcriptionally regulating the target genes and modulating the Pi stress-defensiveness processes."

"12595992","abstracttext","The Yr5 gene confers resistance to all races of the stripe rust pathogen ( Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici) of wheat in the United States. To develop molecular markers for Yr5, a BC(7):F(3) population was developed by backcrossing the Yr5 donor ' Triticum spelta album' (TSA) with the recurrent parent 'Avocet Susceptible' (AVS). Seedlings of the Yr5 near-isogenic lines (AVS/6* Yr5), AVS, TSA, and the BC(7):F(3) lines were tested with North American races of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici under controlled greenhouse conditions. The single gene was confirmed by a 1:2:1 segregation ratio for homozygous-resistant, heterozygous and homozygous-susceptible BC(7):F(3) lines. Genomic DNA was extracted from the parents (the Yr5 near-isogenic line and AVS) and 202 BC(7):F(3) lines. The resistance gene-analog polymorphism (RGAP) technique was used to identify molecular markers. The parents and the homozygous-resistant and homozygous-susceptible BC(7):F(3) bulks were used to identify putative RGAP markers for Yr5. Association of the markers with Yr5 was determined using segregation analysis with DNA from the individual BC(7):F(3) lines. Of 16 RGAP markers confirmed by segregation analysis with 109 BC(7):F(3) lines, and nine of the markers confirmed with an additional 93 BC(7):F(3) lines, three markers co-segregated with the resistance allele and three markers co-segregated with the susceptibility allele at the Yr5 locus. The other four markers were tightly linked to the locus. Analysis of a set of Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic lines with three markers that co-segregated with, or were linked to, the susceptibility allele confirmed that the Yr5 locus is on chromosome 2B. Of five RGAP markers that were cloned and sequenced, markers Xwgp-17 and Xwgp-18 that co-segregated with the Yr5 locus were co-dominant and had 98% homology with each other in both DNA and translated amino-acid sequences. The two markers had 97% homology with a resistance gene-like sequence from Aegilops ventricosa and had significant homology with many known plant resistance genes, resistance gene analogs and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from wheat and other plant species. The markers Xwgp-17 and Xwgp-18 also had significant homology with the NB-ARC domain that is in several genes for plant resistance to diseases, nematode cell death and human apoptotic signaling. These markers should be useful to clone Yr5 and combine Yr5 with other genes for durable and superior resistance for the control of stripe rust."

"12582508","abstracttext","An earliness per se gene, designated Eps-A(m) 1, was mapped in diploid wheat in F(2) and single-seed descent mapping populations from the cross between cultivated (DV92) and wild (G3116) Triticum monococcum accessions. A QTL with a peak on RFLP loci Xcdo393 and Xwg241, the most distal markers on the long arm of chromosome 1A(m), explained 47% of the variation in heading date (LOD score 8.3). Progeny tests for the two F(2:3) families with critical recombination events between Xcdo393 and Xwg241 showed that the gene was distal to Xcdo393 and linked to Xwg241. Progeny tests and replicated experiments with line #3 suggested that Eps-A(m) 1 was distal to Xwg241. This gene showed a large effect on heading date in the controlled environment experiments, and a smaller, but significant, effect under natural conditions. Eps-A(m) 1 showed significant epistatic interactions with photoperiod and vernalization treatments, suggesting that the different classes of genes affecting heading date interact as part of a complex network that controls the timing of flowering induction. Besides its interactions with other genes affecting heading date, Eps-A(m) 1 showed a significant interaction with temperature. The effect of temperature was larger in plants carrying the DV92 allele for late flowering than in those carrying the G3116 allele for early flowering. Average differences in heading date between the experiments performed at 16 degrees C and 23 degrees C were approximately 11 days ( P < 0.001) for the lines carrying the Eps-A(m) 1 allele for early flowering but approximately 50 days ( P < 0.0001) for the lines carrying the allele for late flowering. The large differences in heading time (average 80 days) observed between plants carrying the G3116 and DV92 alleles when grown at 16 degrees C, suggest that it would be possible to produce very detailed maps for this gene to facilitate its future positional cloning."

"16936782","abstracttext","A novel y-type high molecular mass glutenin subunit (HMM-GS) possessing a mobility that is slightly slower than that of the subunit Dy10 obtained by SDS-PAGE, named Dy10.1t, in the wild wheat Aegilops tauschii was identified by 1- and 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The gene encoding the HMM subunit Dy10.1t was amplified with allele-specific PCR primers, and the amplified products were cloned and sequenced. The coding domain of the Dy10.1t subunit gene consisted of 1980 bp encoding a protein of 658 residues with an M rs of 68 611 Da, which was similar to the M rs determined by MALDI-TOF-MS. The deduced amino acid sequence indicated that Dy10.1t subunit displayed a greater similarity to the Dy12 subunit, differing by only 8 amino acid substitutions. Six coding region single-nucleotide polymorphisms were discovered in the Dy10.1t gene by multiple alignments (1 per 330 bp), 1 in the N-terminal domain and the others in the central repeats. Five of them resulted in residue substitutions, whereas 3 created enzyme site changes. The homology and neighbour-joining trees constructed from code domain sequences of 20 x- and y-type glutenin genes from different Triticum species separated into 2 halves, which corresponded to the x-type and y-type HMM glutenin alleles. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Glu-1 gene duplication event probably occurred at about 16.83 million years ago, whereas the divergence times of A, B, and D genomes within x-type and y-type halves were before 7.047 and 10.54 million years ago, respectively."

In addition, 360 RAPD primers were tested on the NILs. Six RFLP probes showed polymorphism between the NILs, and 11 RAPD primers detected one additional band in the resistant NIL. The genetic linkage of the polymorphic markers with Lr24 was tested on a segregating F2 population (150 plants) derived from a cross between the leaf rust resistant Lr24/7 (*) ""Arina"" and the susceptible spelt (Triticum spelta) variety 'Oberkulmer'. All 6 RFLP markers were completely linked to Lr24: one was inherited as a codominant marker (PSR1205), one was in coupling phase (PSR1203) and 4 were in repulsion phase (PSR388, PSR904, PSR931, PSR1067) with Lr24. The localization of these probes on chromosome 3D was confirmed by nulli-tetrasomic analysis. Distorted genotypic segregation was found for the Codominant RFLP marker PSR1205. This distortion can be explained by the occurrence of hemizygous plants. One of the 11 RAPD markers (OPJ-09) also showed complete linkage to theLr24 resistance gene. The polymorphic RAPD fragment was cloned and sequenced. Specific primers were synthesized, and they produced an amplification product only in the resistant plants. This specific marker allows a reliable and rapid screening of a large number of genotypes in practical breeding. Analysis of 6 additional lines containing Lr24 revealed that 3 lines have a smaller chromosomal segment of A. elongatum than lines derived from 'Agent', a commonly used gene donor for the Lr24 resistance gene."

"10231962","abstracttext","We used PCR to obtain phylogenetically informative sequences from the high molecular weight glutenin genes of wheat. The validity of partial sequence comparisons as a means of studying glutenin phylogenetics was established by constructing neighbour-joining trees from partial alignments of 12 published glutenin allele sequences. PCR was then used to obtain 20 novel glutenin allele sequences from various Triticum and Aegilops species, including a 3000 year old preserved wheat. A neighbour-joining tree derived from all known glutenin allele sequences had eight clades, representing the eight loci from which the allele sequences were derived, and was split into two halves, one comprising alleles from the Glu-1-1 loci and the other comprising Glu-1-2 alleles. The topology was compatible with the postulated relationships between the A, B, D, and G genomes. The Glu gene duplication event was tentatively dated at 7.2-10.0 million years ago (MYA), the origin of the four genomes at 5.0-6.9 MYA, and the split between the B and G genomes at 2.5-3.5 MYA. The Glu-B1-1 alleles in cultivated wheats fell into two subgroups that diverged 1.4-2.0 MYA, suggesting that emmer was domesticated twice. The D allele sequences were relatively diverse, indicating that the hybridization event that resulted in the hexaploid bread wheats might have occurred more than once."
"15714326","articletitle","A reconsideration of the domestication geography of tetraploid wheats."
"15714326","abstracttext","The domestication of tetraploid wheats started from their wild progenitor Triticum dicoccoides. In this paper, the geographical distribution of this progenitor is revised to include more sampling locations. The paper is based on a collection of wild and domesticated lines (226 accessions in total) analyzed by AFLP at 169 polymorphic loci. The collection includes the 69 wild lines considered by Mori et al. (2003) in their study on chloroplast DNA haplotypes of T. dicoccoides. The goal of the experiment was to reconsider which location thought to have generated the domesticated germplasm has the highest chance of being the actual site from which wild progenitors were sampled during domestication. Phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear AFLP databases indicates that two different genetic taxa of T. dicoccoides exist, the western one, colonizing Israel, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, and the central-eastern one, which has been frequently sampled in Turkey and rarely in Iran and Iraq. It is the central-eastern race that played the role of the progenitor of the domesticated germplasm. This is supported by the cumulative results of the AFLP data from the collections of Ozkan et al. (2002) and of Mori et al. (2003), which indicate that the Turkish Karacadag population, intermixed with some Iraq-Iran lines, has a tree topology consistent with that of the progenitor of domesticated genotypes. The Turkish Kartal population belongs genetically to the central-eastern T. dicoccoides race but at the nuclear DNA level is less related to the domesticated gene pool. A general agreement between published work on tetraploid wheat domestication emerges from these results. A disagreement is nevertheless evident at the local geographical scale; the chloroplast DNA data indicate the Kartal mountains while AFLP fingerprinting points to the Karacadag Range as the putative site of tetraploid wheat domestication."
"16453131","articletitle","Detection of QTLs for grain protein content in durum wheat."
"16453131","abstracttext","Grain protein content (GPC) of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) is an important trait for the nutritional value of grain and for influencing the technological property of flour. Protein content is a quantitative trait negatively correlated with grain yield, thus increase in protein quantity usually results in yield reduction. This study was initiated to introgress alleles for high GPC from var. dicoccoides into durum wheat germplasm by the backcross inbred line (BIL) method and to identify molecular markers linked to high GPC alleles not associated with depressing effects on yield. The backcross line 3BIL-85 with high GPC and similar grain yield to the recurrent parent was backcrossed to Latino, and the generations F2, F3 and F4 were evaluated for GPC and yield per spike (GYS) in three field trials. Three QTLs with major effects on GPC were detected on chromosome arms 2AS, 6AS and 7BL, identified by the markers Xcfa2164, XP39M37 (250) and Xgwm577, respectively. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the three QTLs explained all the genetic variances of the trait. The high GPC parental line 3BIL-85 was not significantly different from the recurrent parent Latino for GYS, but the phenotypic correlation coefficient between GPC and GYS had negative values (from -0.02 to -0.28) in each trial, although it was statistically significant only in the F3 progeny trial. No co-located QTL for GYS was detected, excluding the hypothesis that the putative QTLs for GPC were indirect QTLs for low grain yield. The negative protein-yield response could be due to: (a) co-location of grain yield per spike QTLs with reduced phenotypic effects not detectable by the experimental design or statistical procedures, or to (b) opposite pleiotropic gene effects due to the major bio-energetic requirements for synthesis of protein then carbohydrates. Mapping loci by BILs should enable the production of near-isogenic lines in which the individual effects of each QTL can be examined in detail without confounding variations due to other putative QTLs."

"19638675","abstracttext","Triticale introgressive lines were developed by incorporating diploid wheat (Triticum monococcum [TM16]) genes into the hexaploid triticale genotype LT522/6. The synthetic allotetraploid T. monococcum cereale (A(m) A(m)RR) was used as a bridging form to introduce the genes. A group of 43 introgressive lines, parental stocks and a check cultivar were inoculated at the seedling stage (in the greenhouse) and at the adult plant stage (in the field) with four pathotypes of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici to determine if the stripe rust resistance was derived from TM16 and to analyze the expression of the diploid wheat gene(s) at the hexaploid level. At the seedling stage, 14 triticale introgressive lines expressed resistance to some of the used pathotypes, showing introduction of a genetic material from the T. monococcum genome. Among them, 7 lines were resistant to all four stripe rust pathotypes applied at this stage. In the field, adult plant resistance and percentage of infected leaf area were scored and transformed into the coefficient of infection. Plant response to stripe rust was compatible at these two developmental stages with a high statistical probability showing the genetic dependence on the same genetic background. Also observed was a full concordance of the adult plant resistance to stripe rust with previously assessed resistance to leaf rust, as well as the highly significant linkage of the resistance to the both diseases at the seedling stage in the set of the tested introgression lines. This result strongly suggests that T. monococcum genes responsible for these characters are located in proximity."

"20680609","abstracttext","Stem rust resistance gene Sr22 transferred to common wheat from Triticum boeoticum and T. monococcum remains effective against commercially prevalent pathotypes of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, including Ug99 and its derivatives. Sr22 was previously located on the long arm of chromosome 7A. Several backcross derivatives (hexaploid) possessing variable sized Sr22-carrying segments were used in this study to identify a closely linked DNA marker. Expressed sequenced tags belonging to the deletion bin 7AL-0.74-0.86, corresponding to the genomic location of Sr22 were screened for polymorphism. In addition, RFLP markers that mapped to this region were targeted. Initial screening was performed on the resistant and susceptible DNA bulks obtained from backcross derivatives carrying Sr22 in three genetic backgrounds with short T. boeoticum segments. A cloned wheat genomic fragment, csIH81, that detected RFLPs between the resistant and susceptible bulks, was converted into a sequence tagged site (STS) marker, named cssu22. Validation was performed on Sr22 carrying backcross-derivatives in fourteen genetic backgrounds and other genotypes used for marker development. Marker cssu22 distinguished all backcross-derivatives from their respective recurrent parents and co-segregated with Sr22 in a Schomburgk (+Sr22)/Yarralinka (-Sr22)-derived recombinant inbred line (RIL) population. Sr22 was also validated in a second population, Sr22TB/Lakin-derived F(4) selected families, containing shortened introgressed segments that showed recombination with previously reported flanking microsatellite markers."

"24306693","abstracttext","Brachypodium distachyon, a small wild grass within the Pooideae family, is a new model organism for exploring the functional genomics of cereal crops. It was shown to have close relationships to wheat, barley and rice. Here, we describe the molecular characterisation and evolutionary relationships of high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) genes from B. distachyon. Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), high performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses demonstrated that there was no HMW-GS expression in the Brachypodium grains due to the silencing of their encoding genes. Through allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) amplification and cloning, a total of 13 HMW-GS encoding genes from diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid Brachypodium species were obtained, and all of them had typical structural features of y-type HMW-GS genes from common wheat and related species, particularly more similar to the 1Dy12 gene. However, the presence of an in-frame premature stop codon (TAG) at position 1521 in the coding region resulted in the conversion of all the genes to pseudogenes. Further, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that HMW-GS genes in B. distachyon displayed a similar trend, but with a low transcriptional expression profile during grain development due to the occurrence of the stop codon. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the highly conserved Glu-1-2 loci were presented in B. distachyon, which displayed close phylogenetic evolutionary relationships with Triticum and related species."

"26132599","abstracttext","Multiparental cross designs for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) provide an efficient alternative to biparental populations because of their broader genetic basis and potentially higher mapping resolution. We describe the development and deployment of a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population in durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) obtained by crossing four elite cultivars. A linkage map spanning 2664 cM and including 7594 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was produced by genotyping 338 RILs. QTL analysis was carried out by both interval mapping on founder haplotype probabilities and SNP bi-allelic tests for heading date and maturity date, plant height and grain yield from four field experiments. Sixteen QTL were identified across environments and detection methods, including two yield QTL on chromosomes 2BL and 7AS, with the former mapped independently from the photoperiod response gene Ppd-B1, while the latter overlapped with the vernalization locus VRN-A3. Additionally, 21 QTL with environment-specific effects were found. Our results indicated a prevalence of environment-specific QTL with relatively small effect on the control of grain yield. For all traits, functionally different QTL alleles in terms of direction and size of genetic effect were distributed among parents. We showed that QTL results based on founder haplotypes closely matched functional alleles at known heading date loci. Despite the four founders, only 2.1 different functional haplotypes were estimated per QTL, on average. This durum wheat population provides a mapping resource for detailed genetic dissection of agronomic traits in an elite background typical of breeding programmes."
"29403518","articletitle","Environmental and Genetic Variation for Yield-Related Traits of Durum Wheat as Affected by Development."
"29403518","abstracttext","Phenology has a profound effect on adaptation and productivity of crops. The impact of phenology on tillering and fertility traits of durum wheat ( Triticum turgidum L. subsp. durum Desf.) was evaluated with the aim of specifying which group of flowering genes ( Vrn, Ppd , or eps ) was involved in their control. A recombinant inbred line population was grown under four contrasting conditions of vernalization and daylength. Phenotyping was carried out according to robust phenological models dissecting both phenological and yield related traits. Whole-genome profiling was performed using the DArT-Seq technology. The genetic variability for tillering was mainly related to the genetic variability for vernalization sensitivity, as shown by the many quantitative trait loci (QTLs) identified in non-vernalized plants associated to both tillering and phenological traits. No effects of photoperiod sensitivity on spikelet number were detected in short-day-grown plants, apparently because of limited genetic variability in photoperiod sensitivity of the population. Earliness per se was involved in control of spikelet number via final leaf number, with these traits genetically correlated and sharing some QTLs. Chaff weight and number of kernels per g chaff were negatively associated and related to anthesis date under most conditions. QTL mapping uncovered novel loci involved in phenological control of tillering and fertility traits, and confirmed the presence of several well-established loci. Phenotyping of both phenology and kernel number according to a robust physiological model amplified the possibility of identifying genetic factors underlying their variations. Also, isolating known flowering gene cues by manipulation of environmental conditions provided the opportunity for each group of genes to be expressed without confounding effects of the others. This information helps to predict the consequences of either genetic manipulation of flowering genes and changes in environmental conditions on the potential yield of durum wheat."

"31974668","abstracttext_key message","Using the ph1b mutant, the recombination frequency between the homoeologous region of 2B and 2G was significantly increased. By this, we narrowed Pm6 to a 0.9 Mb physical region. The powdery mildew (Pm) resistance gene Pm6 from Triticum timopheevii (2n = 48, AAGG) was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 2G and introduced into common wheat in the form of 2B-2G introgressions. The introgression line IGV1-465 has the shortest 2G segment, which is estimated 37 Mb in size when referring to 2BL genome reference of Chinese Spring (CS). The further fine mapping of Pm6 was impeded by the inhibition of allogeneic chromosome recombination between 2B and 2G in the Pm6 region. In the present study, to overcome 2B/2G recombination suppression, a ph1b-based strategy was employed to produce introgressions with reduced 2G fragments for the fine mapping of Pm6. IGV1-465 was crossed and backcrossed to the CSph1b mutant to produce plants with increased 2B/2G chromosome pairing frequency at the Pm6 region. A total of 182 allogeneic recombinants were obtained through two-round screening, i.e., first round of screening of 820 BC 1 F 2:3 progenies using the flanking markers CIT02g-14/CIT02g-19 and second round of screening of 642 BC 1 F 2:4 progenies using the flanking markers CIT02g-13/CIT02g-18, respectively. Through marker analysis using 30 chromosome 2G-specific markers located in the Pm6 region, the identified recombinants were divided into 14 haplotypes. Pm resistance evaluation of these haplotypes enabled us to narrow Pm6 to a 0.9 Mb physical region of 2BL, flanked by markers CIT02g-20 and CIT02g-18. Six wheat varieties containing Pm6 were identified from a natural population, and they showed increased Pm resistance. This implied Pm6 is still effective, especially when used in combination with other Pm resistance genes."

"31355965","abstracttext","Sequence elimination is one of the main mechanisms that increases the divergence among homoeologous chromosomes after allopolyploidization to enhance the stability of recently established lineages, but it can cause a loss of some economically important genes. Synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW) is an important source of genetic variation to the natural hexaploid wheat (NHW) genepool that has low genetic diversity. Here, we investigated the change between SHW and NHW genomes by utilizing a large germplasm set of primary synthetics and synthetic derivatives. Reproducible segment elimination (RSE) was declared if a large chromosomal chunk (>5 cM) produced no aligned reads in more than five SHWs. RSE in five genomic regions was the major source of variation between SHW and NHW. One RSE eliminated almost the complete short arm of chromosome 1B, which contains major genes for flour quality, disease resistance and different enzymes. The occurrence of RSE was highly dependent on the choice of diploid and tetraploid parental lines, their ancestral subpopulation and admixture, e.g. SHWs derived from Triticum dicoccon or from one of two Aegilops tauschii subpopulations were almost free of RSE, while highly admixed parents had higher RSE rates. The rate of RSE in synthetic derivatives was almost double that in primary synthetics. Genome-wide association analysis detected four loci with minor effects on the occurrence of RSE, indicating that both parental lines and genetic factors were affecting the occurrence of RSE. Therefore, pre-pre-breeding strategies should be applied before introducing SHW into pre-breeding programs to ensure genomic stability and avoid undesirable gene loss."

In this study, we cloned three BR receptor homologous genes TaBRI1-A1, -B1 and -D1 from hexaploid wheat ( Triticum estivum L.) and further isolated the TaBRI1-A1, TaBRI1-D1 deletion mutants from the ion beam-induced mutants of variety Xiaoyan81, TaBRI1-A1 and TaBRI1-D1 in which the expression of total receptor TaBRI1 was significantly decreased. The TaBRI1 knock-down mutants exhibited relatively erect leaves and a significant decrease in the 1000-grain weight. Further studies showed that TaBRI1 knock-down mutants showed a significant reduction in photosynthetic rate during the whole grain-filling stage. TaBRI1 knock-down plants generated by TaBRI1-A1, TaBRI1-D1 deletion or using virus-induced gene silencing exhibited the reduction in the efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) ( Fv / Fm , Φ PSII and electron transport rate, ETR) especially under high light and high temperature stresses. The 24-epibrassinolide (EBR) treatment increased CO 2 assimilation rate in the wild type under both normal and high light and high temperature stresses conditions, but this increasing effect was not observed in the TaBRI1 knock-down mutants. Meanwhile, the expression levels of BR biosynthetic genes including TaDWARF4 , TaCPD1 and TaCPD90C1 is not decreased or decreased to a lesser extent in the TaBRI1 knock-down mutants after EBR treatment. These results suggested that TaBRI1 is required for maintaining photosynthesis and tolerance to high light and high temperature stresses both of which are important for grain yield and will be a possible engineered target to control plant photosynthesis and yields in wheat."

This study assesses the significance of using two DNA Barcoding loci (matK and rbcL) in distinguishing between 18 different Triticum accessions in Egypt. We isolated and sequenced 15 rbcL and six matK fragments, but our analysis of the resultant sequences demonstrated a limited ability of matK and rbcL in distinguishing between Triticum accessions. Therefore, we pursued a bioinformatics approach to determine the most useful loci which may be used as DNA barcodes for the Triticum spp. We obtained the 10 available chloroplast genomes of the 10 Triticum species and sub-species from NCBI, and performed chloroplast genome-wide analysis to find the potential barcode loci. A total of 134 chloroplast genes, gene combinations, intergenic regions and intergenic region combinations were tested using a Tree-based method. We were unable to discriminate between Triticum species by using chloroplast genes, gene combinations and intergenic regions. However, a combination of the intergenic region (trnfM-trnT) with either (trnD-psbM), (petN-trnC), (matK-rps16) or (rbcL-psaI) demonstrated a very high discrimination capacity, suggesting their utilization as DNA barcodes for the Triticum plants. Furthermore, our novel DNA barcodes demonstrated high discrimination capacity for other Poaceae members."

"16775696","abstracttext","Three novel low molecular weight (LMW) glutenin subunits from cultivated einkorn (Triticum monococcum L., A(m)A(m), 2n = 2x = 14) were characterized by SDS-PAGE and molecular weights determined by MALDI-TOF-MS. Their coding genes were amplified and cloned with designed AS-PCR primers, revealing three complete gene sequences. All comprised upstream, open reading frame (ORF), downstream and no introns were present. The deduced amino acid sequences showed that all three genes, named as LMW-M1, LMW-M3 and LMW-M5, respectively, belonged to the LMW-i type subunits with the predicted molecular weight between 38.5206 and 38.7028 kDa. They showed high similarity with other LMW-i type genes from hexaploid bread wheats, but also displayed unique features. Particularly, LMW-M5 subunit contained an extra cysteine residue in the C-terminus except for eight conserved cysteines, which resulted from a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the T-C transition, namely arginine --> cysteine substitution at position 242 from the N-terminal end. This is the first report that the LMW-i subunit contained nine cysteines residues that could result in a more highly cross-linked and more elastic glutenin suggesting that LMW-M5 gene may associates with good quality properties. In addition, a total of 25 SNPs and one insertions/deletions (InDels) were detected among three LMW-i genes, which could result in significant functional changes in polymer formation of gluten. It is anticipated that these SNPs could be used as reliable genetic markers during wheat quality improvement. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that LMW-i type genes apparently differed from LMW-m and LMW-s type genes and diverged early from the primitive LMW-GS gene family, at about 12.92 million years ago (MYA) while the differentiation of A(m) and A genomes was estimated at 3.98 MYA."

"20063107","abstracttext","Allelic differences at the VRN1 (AP1/CAL/FRU), VRN2 (ZCCT) and VRN3 (FT) vernalization genes affect flowering time in wheat. The two maintained vegetative phase (mvp) mutants from Triticum monococcum L., previously reported as carrying a single gene (VRN1) deletion, are incapable of flowering. In this study, we show that both mvp lines have larger deletions that include the genes AGLG1, CYS, PHYC, VRN1 and possibly others. The original mvp deletions were generated in lines that lack the VRN2 gene. Therefore, to study the effect of the mvp deletions on the regulation of VRN2 we generated populations segregating for both genes simultaneously. The two mvp deletions co-segregated with the non-flowering phenotype, but surprisingly, the lines homozygous for the mvp mutations showed reduced transcript levels of both VRN2 and FT relative to the wild type. The VRN1 deletion is an unlikely cause of the down-regulation of VRN2 since VRN2 transcript levels are higher in the fall, before VRN1 is expressed, and are down-regulated by VRN1. Since both VRN2 and FT are regulated by light and photoperiod, their down-regulation in the mvp mutants might be related to the deletion of the PHYC photoreceptor. However, alternative hypotheses including combinations of other genes deleted in the mvp mutants cannot be ruled out. Until the specific gene(s) responsible for the down-regulation of VRN2 and FT and the non-flowering phenotype are precisely identified, it is premature to use these results to postulate alternative flowering models."

"29491869","abstracttext","Powdery mildew resistance gene Pm4b , originating from Triticum persicum , is effective against the prevalent Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici ( Bgt ) isolates from certain regions of wheat production in China. The lack of tightly linked molecular markers with the target gene prevents the precise identification of Pm4b during the application of molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS). The strategy that combines the RNA-Seq technique and the bulked segregant analysis (BSR-Seq) was applied in an F 2:3 mapping population (237 families) derived from a pair of isogenic lines VPM1/7 ∗ Bainong 3217 F 4 (carrying Pm4b ) and Bainong 3217 to develop more closely linked molecular markers. RNA-Seq analysis of the two phenotypically contrasting RNA bulks prepared from the representative F 2:3 families generated 20,745,939 and 25,867,480 high-quality read pairs, and 82.8 and 80.2% of them were uniquely mapped to the wheat whole genome draft assembly for the resistant and susceptible RNA bulks, respectively. Variant calling identified 283,866 raw single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and InDels between the two bulks. The SNPs that were closely associated with the powdery mildew resistance were concentrated on chromosome 2AL. Among the 84 variants that were potentially associated with the disease resistance trait, 46 variants were enriched in an about 25 Mb region at the distal end of chromosome arm 2AL. Four Pm4b -linked SNP markers were developed from these variants. Based on the sequences of Chinese Spring where these polymorphic SNPs were located, 98 SSR primer pairs were designed to develop distal markers flanking the Pm4b gene. Three SSR markers, Xics13 , Xics43 , and Xics76 , were incorporated in the new genetic linkage map, which located Pm4b in a 3.0 cM genetic interval spanning a 6.7 Mb physical genomic region. This region had a collinear relationship with Brachypodium distachyon chromosome 5, rice chromosome 4, and sorghum chromosome 6. Seven genes associated with disease resistance were predicted in this collinear genomic region, which included C2 domain protein, peroxidase activity protein, protein kinases of PKc_like super family, Mlo family protein, and catalytic domain of the serine/threonine kinases (STKc_IRAK like super family). The markers developed in the present study facilitate identification of Pm4b during its MAS practice."

"27889157","abstracttext","The present work was carried out to retrieve the origin of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in sourdough. To this purpose, wheat LAB were monitored from ear harvest until the first step of fermentation for sourdough development. The influence of the geographical area and variety on LAB species/strain composition was also determined. The ears of four Triticum durum varieties (Duilio, Iride, Saragolla and Simeto) were collected from several fields located within the Palermo province (Sicily, Italy) and microbiologically investigated. In order to trace the transfer of LAB during the consecutive steps of manipulation, ears were transformed aseptically and, after threshing, milling and fermentation, samples of kernels, semolinas and doughs, respectively, were analysed. LAB were not found to dominate the microbial communities of the raw materials. In general, kernels harboured lower levels of microorganisms than ears and ears than semolinas. Several samples showing no development of LAB colonies acidified the enrichment broth suggesting the presence of LAB below the detection limit. After fermentation, LAB loads increased consistently for all doughs, reaching levels of 7.0-7.5 Log CFU/g on M17. The values of pH (5.0) and TTA (5.6 mL NaOH/10 g of dough) indicated the occurrence of the acidification process for several doughs. LAB were phenotypically and genotypically differentiated by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR into eight groups including 51 strains belonging to the species Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus coryniformis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garvieae, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus faecium, Leuconostoc citreum, and Pediococcus pentosaceus. Lactobacilli constituted a minority the LAB community, while lactococci represented more than 50% of strains. Lower LAB complexity was found on kernels, while a richer biodiversity was observed in semolinas and fermented doughs. For broader microbiota characterisation in doughs before fermentation, the 16S rRNA gene fragment profiling was conducted on the unfermented doughs using MiSeq Illumina. LAB group was represented by Enterococcus, Lactococcus and members of Leuconostocaceae family whose relative abundances differed according to both geographical area and variety of wheat. The culture-independent approach confirmed that pediococci and lactobacilli constituted low abundance members of the semolina LAB microbiota and that although some strains may pass from wheat ear to fermented doughs, most are likely to come from other sources."

Gene copy concentrations determined by the qPCR were calibrated against pure culture mycelium of T. aestivum, enabling quantification of the mycelium in soil and in host roots from the fields. Significant concentrations of the fungus were observed not only in the finest roots with ectomycorrhizae but also in other root types, indicating that the fungus is an important component of the microbial film at the root surface. The concentration of T. aestivum in soil is relatively high compared to other ectomycorrhizal fungi. To evaluate the reliability of the measurement of the soil mycelium density using qPCR, the steady basal extracellular concentration of the stabilized T. aestivum DNA should be known and taken into account. Therefore, we addressed the stability of the qPCR signal in soil subjected to different treatments. After the field soil was sieved, regardless of whether it was dried/rewetted or not, the T. aestivum DNA was quickly decomposed. It took just about 4 days to reach a steady concentration. This represents a conserved pool of T. aestivum DNA and determines detection limit of the qPCR quantification in our case. When the soil was autoclaved and recolonized by saprotrophic microorganisms, this conserved DNA pool was eliminated and the soil became free of T. aestivum DNA."

"25846877","abstracttext","Trehalose plays an important role in metabolic regulation and abiotic stress tolerance in plants. Trehalose contents are potentially modulated by trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS), which is a key enzyme in the trehalose biosynthetic pathway. Using available wheat expressed sequence tag sequence information from NCBI and two wheat genome databases, we identified 12 wheat TPS genes and performed a comprehensive study on their structural, evolutionary and functional properties. The estimated divergence time of wheat TPS gene pairs and wheat-rice orthologues suggested that wheat and rice have a common ancestor. The number of TPS genes in the wheat genome was estimated to be at least 12, which is close to the number found in rice, Arabidopsis and soybean. Moreover, it has been reported earlier in other plants that TPS genes respond to abiotic stress, however, our study mainly analysed the TPS gene family under freezing conditions in winter wheat, and determined that most of the TPS gene expression in winter wheat was induced by freezing conditions, which further suggested that wheat TPS genes were involved in winter wheat freeze-resistance signal transduction pathways. Taken together, the current study represents the first comprehensive study of TPS genes in winter wheat and provides a foundation for future functional studies of this important gene family in Triticeae."

"32462194","abstracttext","NPF genes encode membrane transporters involved in the transport of a large variety of substrates including nitrate and peptides. The NPF gene family has been described for many plants, but the whole NPF gene family for wheat has not been completely identified. The release of the wheat reference genome has enabled the identification of the entire wheat NPF gene family. A systematic analysis of the whole wheat NPF gene family was performed, including responses of specific gene expression to development and nitrogen supply. A total of 331 NPF genes (113 homoeologous groups) have been identified in wheat. The chromosomal location of the NPF genes is unevenly distributed, with predominant occurrence in the long arms of the chromosomes. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that wheat NPF genes are closely clustered with Arabidopsis, Brachypodium, and rice orthologues, and subdivided into eight subfamilies. The expression profiles of wheat NPF genes were examined using RNA-seq data, and a subset of 44 NPF genes (homoeologous groups) with contrasting expression responses to nitrogen and/or development in different tissues were identified. The systematic identification of gene composition, chromosomal locations, evolutionary relationships, and expression profiles contributes to a better understanding of the roles of the wheat NPF genes and lays the foundation for further functional analysis in wheat."

"18514805","abstracttext","This study investigated the presence of carbohydrates N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and sialic acid oligosaccharides, in the uterine epithelium of pseudopregnant rats treated with ovarian hormones and Clomiphene citrate (CC) a commonly used fertility drug associated with low pregnancy rates. Ovariectomized sexually mature rats were given 0.25mg CC prior to the implantation-priming hormone sequence of 5mg progesterone for 3 days and a single dose of 0.5microg estradiol-17beta (E(2)) on day 3 (PP(PE)) and sacrificed 24h after the last hormone treatment. Uterine tissue was incubated with the lectin Triticum vulgare (wheat germ agglutinin, WGA), associated with avidin and subsequently labelled with biotinylated-ferritin for electron microscopy, a combined alcian blue/PAS technique for light microscopy and RT-PCR was run for progesterone-associated endometrial protein (PAEP) gene, a pregnancy related endometrial gene that is associated with the protein thought to express carbohydrates in the uterus and suppress immune function. The results indicate that CC administration decreases the expression of these carbohydrates both at a cellular level and genetic level when compared to the PP(PE) group. However, the lowest expression of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and sialic acid was seen in the placebo group. The ovarian hormones were therefore shown to be important for the synthesis of these carbohydrates that are important in the implantation period and the maintenance of pregnancy. The results suggest that the effect of CC on the expression of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and sialic acid is a significant reason why there are low pregnancy rates with CC use."

"16765389","abstracttext","Wheat seedlings (Triticum durum Desf.) were incubated in 100muM Cu(2+) for different periods of time ranging from 1min up to 16h. Following metal addition a rapid intake of copper ions into the roots was observed. Cu(2+) induced an accumulation of both phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylbutanol within 1min of incubation, the latter indicating a very rapid induction of phospholipase D (PLD) activity. The highest PLD stimulation was detected after 2h from copper addition and decreased almost to the initial value at increasing times. Cycloheximide treatment of roots lowered phosphatidylbutanol accumulation because of a reduced PLD activity. The expression profile of a T. durum putative PLD-encoding gene showed a peak after 1h of treatment as well, indicating that enhanced gene expression contributed to the increase in PLD activity. In the absence of copper ions, roots treated with the G protein activator mastoparan showed increases in phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylbutanol similar to those detected with the metal. PLD activity was also stimulated by cholera toxin. Two putatively G protein alpha subunit encoding sequences were isolated and no significant differences in transcription activity following Cu(2+) addition were observed. In copper-treated roots an early production of superoxide generated both by total and membrane-bound NADPH oxidase occurred. The G protein inhibitor suramin as well as the PLD antagonist 1-butanol abolished copper-induced superoxide production."

"18943794","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Stagonospora nodorum leaf blotch is an economically important foliar disease in the major wheat-growing areas of the world. In related work, we identified a host-selective toxin (HST) produced by the S. nodorum isolate Sn2000 and determined the chromosomal location of the host gene (Snn1) conditioning sensitivity to the toxin using the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative mapping population and cytogenetic stocks. In this study, we used the same plant materials to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with resistance to fungal inoculations of Sn2000 and investigate the role of the toxin in causing disease. Disease reactions were scored at 5, 7, and 10 days postinoculation to evaluate changes in the degree of effectiveness of individual QTL. A major QTL was identified on the short arm of chromosome 1B, which coincided with the snn1 toxin-insensitivity gene. This locus explained 58% of the phenotypic variation for the 5-day reading but decreased to 27% for the 10-day reading, indicating that the toxin is most effective in the early stages of the interaction. In addition, relatively minor QTL were identified on chromosomes 3AS, 3DL, 4AL, 4BL, 5DL, 6AL, and 7BL, but not all minor QTL were significant for all readings and their effects varied. Multiple regression models explained from 68% of the phenotypic variation for the 5-day reading to 36% for the 10-day reading. The Chinese Spring nullisomic 1B tetrasomic 1D line and the Chinese Spring-Triticum dicoccoides disomic 1B chromosome substitution line, which were insensitive to SnTox1, were more resistant to the fungus than the rest of the nullisomictetrasomic and disomic chromosome substitution lines. Our results indicate that the toxin produced by isolate Sn2000 is a major virulence factor."

"17721744","abstracttext","An Indian isolate of Rice tungro bacilliform virus from West Bengal (RTBV-WB) showed significant nucleotide differences in its putative promoter region when compared with a previously characterized isolate from Philippines. The transcription start site of RTBV-WB was mapped followed by assessing the activity and tissue-specificity of the full-length (FL) promoter (-231 to +645) and several of its upstream and downstream deletions by studying the expression of beta-Glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L. subsp. indica) plants at various stages of development. In addition to the expected vascular-specific expression pattern, studied by histochemical staining, GUS enzymatic assay and northern and RT-PCR analysis, two novel patterns were revealed in some of the downstream deleted versions; a non-expressing type, representing no expression at any stage in any tissue and constitutive type, representing constitutive expression at all stages in most tissues. This indicated the presence of previously unreported positive and negative cis-regulatory elements in the downstream region. The negative element and a putative enhancer region in the upstream region specifically bound to rice nuclear proteins in vitro. The FL and its deletion derivatives were also active in heterologous systems like tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and wheat (Triticum durum). Expression patterns in tobacco were different from those observed in rice suggesting the importance of upstream elements in those systems and host-specific regulation of the promoter in diverse organisms. Thus, the RTBV-WB FL promoter and its derivatives contain an array of cis-elements, which control constitutive or tissue- and development-specific gene expression in a combinatorial fashion."

"19360986","abstracttext","The differentiation of genetic diversity was estimated among 15 wild emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccoides) populations of the macrogeographic scale in Israel by 25 EST-SSR markers. A total of 92 EST-SSR alleles were detected, and the number of alleles ranged from 1 to 7 with an average of 3.68 per locus. Allele numbers and the polymorphic information content (PIC)value of EST-SSR loci on the B genome were higher than those on the A genome. The genetic similarity coefficient (GS)varied from 0.189 to 0.966, and all genotypes were clustered into four major groups. The population Mt. Gerizim had the highest genetic variations, whereas the population Beit-Oren had the lowest genetic variations. Most of genetic variance existed within populations was observed based on the coefficient of gene differentiation (F(ST)=0.355). The value of genetic distance (D) between the populations varied from 0.112 to 0.672 with an average of 0.406, and the results of Mantel test(r=0.104, p=0.809) showed that the estimates of genetic distance were geographically independent. The values of Nei's gene diversity (He) and Shannon's information index (I) correlated negatively with the temperature factor: mean January temperature (Tj), whereas they correlated positively with another factor: mean number of Sharav days (Sh). The correlation matrix between He in the EST-SSRs and climatic variables contained 37 significant (pB0.05) correlations. The present study established that T. dicoccoides in Israel had a considerable amount of genetic variations at EST-SSR loci at least partly correlated with ecological factors. These results suggested that EST-SSR diversity is adaptive by natural selection and influenced by both internal and external factors and their interactions."

Subunits of this enzyme over-express under stress conditions. Little is known about the structure and regulatory mechanism of the F(0) portion of this enzyme. We isolated the full-length coding sequence of the RMtATP6 gene from rice and wheat, and partial sequences from Aegilops crassa and Triticum monococcum (Poaceae). We found that the sequence of rice RMtATP6 is 1965 bp long and contains two exons and one intron in 3'-UTR. Then, we analyzed the 2000-bp upstream region of the initiation codon ATG of the RMtATP6 and AtMtATP6, as promoter. The RMtATP6 coding sequence was found to be much conserved in the different plant species, possibly because of its key role under stress conditions. Promoter analysis demonstrated that RMtATP6 and AtMtATP6 include cis-acting elements such as ABRE, MYC/MYB, GT element in the upstream region, which respond to abscisic acid stress hormone and might show vital its roles in biotic and abiotic tolerance as an early-stress responsive gene. A mitochondrial signal peptide of 30 amino acids in length and an N-terminal cleavage site between amino acids 20 and 21 were discovered in RMtATP6. In addition, we found a transmembrane domain with an alpha helix structure that possibly passed through the mitochondrial inner membrane and established the 6-kDa subunit in the F(0) portion of the enzyme complex. Apparently, under stress conditions, with increasing ATP consumption by the cell, the 6-kDa subunit accumulates; by switching on F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase it provides additional energy needed for cell homeostasis."

"25017054","abstracttext","Drought is one of the most important abiotic stresses, constraining crop production seriously. The dehydration responsive element binding proteins (DREBs) are important plant-specific transcription factors that respond to various abiotic stresses and consequently induce abiotic stress-related genes that impart stress endurance in plants. Wild species are naturally exposed to various abiotic stresses and potentially harbor suitable alleles through natural selection. In this study we isolated and characterized Dreb2 from Triticum urartu (GenBank: KF731664), Aegilops speltoides (GenBank: KF731665) and Aegilops tauschii (GenBank: KF731663), the A, B and D genome ancestors of bread wheat, respectively. Analysis of over 1.3 kb upstream region of the gene revealed the presence of several conserved cis-acting regulatory elements including ABA-responsive elements, low temperature responsive elements, and several light and environmental signaling related motifs potentially vindicate Dreb2 responses to environmental signals. Moreover, the gene exhibited an alternative splicing, conserved among orthologous genes in grasses, and produced a non-functional isoform due to splicing in an exon resulted frame-shift creating an early stop codon before the functional domain. The expression analysis of Dreb2 under normal and different levels of dehydration stress conditions indicated that the two active spliced isoforms are upregulated when the plant exposed to drought stress whereas the non-functional isoform is downregulated in severe drought."

"29367015","abstracttext","Using heavy-ion beam mutagenesis of Triticum monococcum strain KU104-1, we identified a mutant that shows extra early-flowering; it was named extra early-flowering 3 (exe3). Here, we carried out expression analyses of clock-related genes, clock downstream genes and photoperiod pathway genes, and found that the clock component gene PHYTOCLOCK 1/LUX ARRHYTHMO (PCL1/LUX) was not expressed in exe3 mutant plants. A PCR analysis of DNA markers indicated that the exe3 mutant had a deletion of wheat PCL1/LUX (WPCL1), and that the WPCL1 deletion was correlated with the mutant phenotype in the segregation line. We confirmed that the original strain KU104-1 carried a mutation that produced a null allele of a flowering repressor gene VERNALIZATION 2 (VRN2). As a result, the exe3 mutant has both WPCL1 and VRN2 loss-of-function mutations. Analysis of plant development in a growth chamber showed that vernalization treatment accelerated flowering time in the exe3 mutant under short day (SD) as well as long day (LD) conditions, and the early-flowering phenotype was correlated with the earlier up-regulation of VRN1. The deletion of WPCL1 affects the SD-specific expression patterns of some clock-related genes, clock downstream genes and photoperiod pathway genes, suggesting that the exe3 mutant causes a disordered SD response. The present study indicates that VRN1 expression is associated with the biological clock and the VRN1 up-regulation is not influenced by the presence or absence of VRN2."

"28286900","abstracttext_key message","Markers linked to stem rust resistance gene Sr47 were physically mapped in three small Aegilops speltoides chromosomal bins. Five markers, including two PCR-based SNP markers, were validated for marker-assisted selection. In durum wheat (Triticum turgidum subsp. durum), the gene Sr47 derived from Aegilops speltoides conditions resistance to race TTKSK (Ug99) of the stem rust pathogen (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici). Sr47 is carried on small interstitial translocation chromosomes (Ti2BL-2SL-2BL·2BS) in which the Ae. speltoides chromosome 2S segments are divided into four bins in genetic stocks RWG35, RWG36, and RWG37. Our objective was to physically map molecular markers to bins and to determine if any of the molecular markers would be useful in marker-assisted selection (MAS). Durum cultivar Joppa was used as the recurrent parent to produce three BC 2 F 2 populations. Each BC 2 F 2 plant was genotyped with markers to detect the segment carrying Sr47, and stem rust testing of BC 2 F 3 progeny with race TTKSK confirmed the genotyping. Forty-nine markers from published sources, four new SSR markers, and five new STARP (semi-thermal asymmetric reverse PCR) markers, were evaluated in BC 2 F 2 populations for assignment of markers to bins. Sr47 was mapped to bin 3 along with 13 markers. No markers were assigned to bin 1; however, 7 and 13 markers were assigned to bins 2 and 4, respectively. Markers Xrwgs38a, Xmag1729, Xwmc41, Xtnac3119, Xrwgsnp1, and Xrwgsnp4 were found to be useful for MAS of Sr47. However, STARP markers Xrwgsnp1 and Xrwgsnp4 can be used in gel-free systems, and are the preferred markers for high-throughput MAS. The physical mapping data from this study will also be useful for pyramiding Sr47 with other Sr genes on chromosome 2B."

"30954019","abstracttext","Catalase proteins play a crucial role in detoxifying hydrogen peroxide, generated during plant growth, and in response to various environmental stresses. Despite their importance, little is known about their localization and expression in wheat. In this study, we identified and characterized a novel peroxisomal catalase gene from Triticum monococcum, designated as TmCAT1. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that TmCAT1 shared high identity with TdCAT1 and other plant catalases belonging to subfamily 1. We predicted the 3D structure model and the oligomerization arrangement of TmCAT1. Besides, we displayed an arrangement in asymmetric unit, which involved interactions including, mainly, residues from N-terminal domain. Interestingly, sequence analysis indicated that TmCAT1, like TdCAT1, had the peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1) around its C-terminus. Transient expression of TmCAT1-GFP and TdCAT1-GFP in tobacco leaves revealed that the two fused proteins are targeted into peroxisomes. However, the truncated forms lacking the tripeptide QKL remained in the cytosol. Concerning the expression profile analysis, TmCAT1 is expressed especially in leaves in normal condition. On the other hand, it is up-regulated by different stress incorporating salt, osmotic, oxidative, heavy metal and hormones stresses. Functional analysis by heterologous expression in yeast cells showed that TmCAT1 improved tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses. The presence of important cis-regulatory elements in the promoter region of TmCAT1 strongly reinforces the interest of this gene in plant adaptation to various stresses."

The wheat MnSOD gene was the longest among those sequenced from plant species. The transcription initiation site was preceded by a G+C-rich promoter without a TATA or CAAT box. The promoter contained many putative cis-acting regulatory elements, including an abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive element, a stress-responsive element, and a GC-repeat, as well as several other structural features in common with the promoter of the rice MnSOD gene. A Stowaway-like transposable element was found in intron 5 of the wheat MnSOD gene, but further investigation revealed the transposable element was not present in all copies of the MnSOD genes."

The mechanism of transgenic wheat seeds with antisense trxs gene, which is responsible for low germination rate was studied through analyzing the changes in proteins of wheat seeds during germination. The antisense trxs could weaken the metabolism of wheat seeds by decreasing the quantity of proteins involved in metabolism, while chloroform-methanol (CM) protein fraction consisted mostly of some low molecular weight proteins (<20 kD). Compared with wild-type wheat seeds, the folding of glutenin in transgenic wheat ones was affected during the wheat maturating. Big glutenin macropolymers could be formed more easily in transgenic wheat seeds than in wild-type wheat ones. Therefore, the degradation speed of glutenin in transgenic wheat seeds was slower than that in wild-type wheat ones during seed germination. In addition, the degradation of some proteins in transgenic wheat embryos was also delayed during germination."

"2987849","abstracttext","The wheat mitochondrial gene for apocytochrome b (CYB) has been identified by its hybridization to a yeast CYB probe and its nucleotide sequence has been determined. The wheat CYB sequence predicts a cytochrome b apoprotein of 398 amino acids; it is almost identical to that of maize but has ten additional amino acids at the carboxy terminus. No introns are present in the wheat CYB gene, but an internal segment of the gene is repeated at another genomic location. Transcript analysis reveals a single wheat CYB mRNA of approximately 2.4 kb with a long untranslated leader. Sequences upstream of the CYB coding region are very similar in wheat and maize but the stretch proposed to be a ribosome binding site in maize is not conserved in wheat. The corresponding leader regions of the wheat mitochondrial mRNAs for cytochrome oxidase subunits I and II also lack complementarity to the 3'-end of the small subunit rRNA. We conclude that alternative signals are involved in the initiation of translation in plant mitochondria."

"11038571","abstracttext","Spores harboring an ACC1 deletion derived from a diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, in which one copy of the entire ACC1 gene is replaced with a LEU2 cassette, fail to grow. A chimeric gene consisting of the yeast GAL10 promoter, yeast ACC1 leader, wheat cytosolic acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) cDNA, and yeast ACC1 3' tail was used to complement a yeast ACC1 mutation. The complementation demonstrates that active wheat ACCase can be produced in yeast. At low concentrations of galactose, the activity of the ""wheat gene"" driven by the GAL10 promoter is low and ACCase becomes limiting for growth, a condition expected to enhance transgenic yeast sensitivity to wheat ACCase-specific inhibitors. An aryloxyphenoxypropionate and two cyclohexanediones do not inhibit growth of haploid yeast strains containing the yeast ACC1 gene, but one cyclohexanedione inhibits growth of the gene-replacement strains at concentrations below 0.2 mM. In vitro, the activity of wheat cytosolic ACCase produced by the gene-replacement yeast strain is inhibited by haloxyfop and cethoxydim at concentrations above 0.02 mM. The activity of yeast ACCase is less affected. The wheat plastid ACCase in wheat germ extract is inhibited by all three herbicides at concentrations below 0.02 mM. Yeast gene-replacement strains will provide a convenient system for the study of plant ACCases."

Here we designed a new wheat exome capture probe panel based on IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 genome sequence information and developed an effective algorithm, varBScore, that can sufficiently reduce the background noise in gene mapping and identification. An effective method, termed bulked segregant exome capture sequencing (BSE-Seq) for identifying causal mutations or candidate genes was established by combining the use of a newly designed wheat exome capture panel, sequencing of bulked segregant pools from segregating populations, and the robust algorithm varBScore. We evaluated the effectiveness of varBScore on SNP calling using the published dataset for mapping and cloning the yellow rust resistance gene Yr7 in wheat. Furthermore, using BSE-Seq, we rapidly identified a wheat yellow leaf mutant gene, ygl1 , in an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutant population and found that a single mutation of G to A at 921 position in the wild type YGL1 gene encoding magnesium-chelatase subunit chlI caused the leaf yellowing phenotype. We further showed that mutation of YGL1 through CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing led to a yellow phenotype on the leaves of transgenic wheat, indicating that  ygl1  is the correct causal gene responsible for the mutant phenotype. In summary, our approach is highly efficient for discovering causal mutations and gene cloning in wheat."

"28690617","abstracttext","Deficiency of necessary macronutrients, i.e., Potassium (K), Magnesium (Mg), Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Sulfate (S) in the soil leads to a reduction in plant growth and yield, which is a result of changes in expression level of various genes. This study was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes and its associated metabolic pathways occurred in soil grown wheat root samples excavated from the control and treated fields. To identify the difference in gene expression levels due to deficiency of the said nutrients, a transcriptomic, meta-analysis was performed on array expression profile data. A set of 435 statistically significant probes encoding 398 Nutrient Deficiency Response Genes (NRGs) responding at-least one nutrients deficiency (ND) were identified. Out of them 55 NRGs were found to response to minimum two ND. Singular Enrichment Analysis (SEA) predicts ontological based classifications and functional analysis of NRGs in different cellular/molecular pathways involved in root development and growth. Functional annotation and reaction mechanism of differentially expressed genes, proteins/enzymes in the different metabolic pathway through MapMan analysis were explored. Further the meta-analysis was performed to revels the active involvement each NRGs in distinct tissues and their comparative potential expression analysis in different stress conditions. The study results in exploring the role of major acting candidate genes such as Non-specific serine/threonine protein kinase, Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase, Peroxides, Glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase proenzyme, Dehydrin family proteins, Transcription factors, Membrane Proteins, Metal binding proteins, Photosystem proteins, Transporter and Transferase associated in different metabolic pathways. Finally, the differences of transcriptional responses in the soil-grown root of T. aestivum cv. and in-vitro grown model plants under nutrients deficiency were summarized."

"31621500","abstracttext","Transcription factor NAM-B1 has a major role in the process of senescence, which results in higher Fe and Zn concentrations in grains of wild wheat ( T. durum ; Td). The absence of the wild type NAMB1 in T. aestivum (Ta), one of the cardinal crops essential for more than 1/3 rd of the global population, affects Fe and Zn remobilisation to the maturing grain from the flag leaf resulting in lesser micronutrient bioavailability. The cardinal difference in the NAMB1 gene between the two species is the absence of +1 bp allele in Ta. Insilico studies using NAMB1 from Td and Ta was performed to explore the variation in the interaction with the conserved cis-element DNA motif (CATGTG) as both the proteins share the same domain, but there are no in silico studies reported of these proteins. The secondary structure, 3D-modelling of the proteins, DNA-protein docking and dynamics have computed by Schrodinger Prime Suite. Predicted secondary structures were energy minimised using Macromodel and docking was performed based on binding energy and hydrogen bonds. Molecular dynamics simulation of NAMB1-Ta and NAMB1-Td individually and with the cis-element motif, performed for 100 ns, revealed significant variations in the protein-DNA interaction in Ta. This work provides the modelled 3D-interaction profile caused by a single bp frameshift mutation in understanding the difference in function between NAMB1 orthologs due to lack of NAC domain. The overall computational analysis reveals that NAMB1-Ta and NAMB1-Td proteins display a good amount of dissimilarity in their structure, dynamics and DNA-binding characteristics.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The psbA gene is located in the large single copy region adjacent to one inverted repeat and is transcribed toward the latter. The sequence of the 5' end of the wheat gene is homologous with dicot psbA genes. We have located the 5' terminus of the wheat psbA RNA to a position 83 nt upstream of its coding region. The same psbA RNA species was capped in vitro by guanylyltransferase, establishing that its 5' end is a transcription start site. Regions which resemble procaryotic -10 and -35 promoter elements are located immediately upstream of the wheat psbA transcription initiation site."

"16865332","abstracttext","The high-quality rice genome sequence is serving as a reference for comparative genome analysis in crop plants, especially cereals. However, early comparisons with bread wheat showed complex patterns of conserved synteny (gene content) and colinearity (gene order). Here, we show the presence of ancient duplicated segments in the progenitor of wheat, which were first identified in the rice genome. We also show that single-copy (SC) rice genes, those representing unique matches with wheat expressed sequence tag (EST) unigene contigs in the whole rice genome, show more than twice the proportion of genes mapping to syntenic wheat chromosome as compared to the multicopy (MC) or duplicated rice genes. While 58.7% of the 1,244 mapped SC rice genes were located in single syntenic wheat chromosome groups, the remaining 41.3% were distributed randomly to the other six non-syntenic wheat groups. This could only be explained by a background dispersal of genes in the genome through transposition or other unknown mechanism. The breakdown of rice-wheat synteny due to such transpositions was much greater near the wheat centromeres. Furthermore, the SC rice genes revealed a conserved primordial gene order that gives clues to the origin of rice and wheat chromosomes from a common ancestor through polyploidy, aneuploidy, centromeric fusions, and translocations. Apart from the bin-mapped wheat EST contigs, we also compared 56,298 predicted rice genes with 39,813 wheat EST contigs assembled from 409,765 EST sequences and identified 7,241 SC rice gene homologs of wheat. Based on the conserved colinearity of 1,063 mapped SC rice genes across the bins of individual wheat chromosomes, we predicted the wheat bin location of 6,178 unmapped SC rice gene homologs and validated the location of 213 of these in the telomeric bins of 21 wheat chromosomes with 35.4% initial success. This opens up the possibility of directed mapping of a large number of conserved SC rice gene homologs in wheat. Overall, only 46.4% of these SC genes code for proteins with known functional domains; the remaining 53.6% have unknown function, and hence, represent an important, but yet, under explored category of genes."

The single, dominant, seedling yellow rust resistance gene, designated YrMoro, was mapped to the group 1 chromosomes. The STS marker was developed from an AFLP band which cosegregated with the YrMoro gene. Sequence-specific primers were made which incorporated the selective bases of the AFLP primers, plus 16 and 17 additional bases extending into the AFLP band. This simple, PCR-based marker will allow wheat breeders to pyramid this resistance gene, along with other resistance genes, into a single wheat genotype."

The deduced amino acid sequence of the two cDNAs showed a high degree of identity with COMT from other plants and were most similar to COMTs from monocots. RNA gel blot hybridization demonstrated that the wheat COMT gene W-cm5-1 was expressed in stem, root and leaf tissues. W-cm5-1 mRNA levels in the developing wheat stem were associated with the stem lodging character in two wheat cultivars. These results suggest that the action of the wheat COMT gene may be related to stem rigidity and lodging character in wheat."

The gene was transmitted to the progeny following Mendelian rules. Segregation and loss of the selectable marker gene was also found in three out of six events from other experiments where high-molecular-weight glutenin genes were expressed or over-expressed.

In the present study, meiotic phenotypic differences on homoeologous chromosome pairing at metaphase I between hybrids of wheat genotypes Chinese Spring ph1b (CSph1b) and KL with rye were studied by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). The frequency of wheat-wheat associations was higher in CSph1b×rye than in KL×rye. However, frequencies of wheat-rye and rye-rye associations were higher in KL×rye than in CSph1b×rye. These differences may be the result of different mechanisms of control between the ph-like gene(s) controlling homoeologous chromosome pairing in KL and CSph1b. Wheat-wheat associations were much more frequent than wheat-rye pairing in both hybriods. This may be caused by lower overall affinity, or homoeology, between wheat and rye chromosomes than between wheat chromosomes."

"15889729","abstracttext","A study to determine yield response to the Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko), was conducted during the 1997-1998 and 1998-1999 growing seasons at three eastern Colorado locations, Akron, Fort Collins, and Lamar, with three wheat lines containing either Russian wheat aphid-resistant Dn4 gene, Dn6 gene, or resistance derived from PI 222668, and TAM 107 as the susceptible control. Russian wheat aphids per tiller were greater on TAM 107 than the resistant wheat lines at the 10x infestation level at Fort Collins and Akron in 1999. Yield, seed weight, and number of seeds per spike for each wheat line were somewhat affected by Russian wheat aphid per tiller mainly at Fort Collins. The infested resistant wheat lines harbored fewer Russian wheat aphids and yielded more than the infested susceptible wheat lines. Wheat lines containing the Dn4, Dn6, and PI 222668 genes contain different levels of antibiosis or antixenosis and tolerance. Although differences existed among sites and resistance, there is a benefit to planting resistant wheat when there is a potential for Russian wheat aphid infestations."
"32983186","articletitle","TaTCP-1 , a Novel Regeneration-Related Gene Involved in the Molecular Regulation of Somatic Embryogenesis in Wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.)."
"32983186","abstracttext","The lower regeneration rate of wheat calli is the main factor restricting the development of transgenic wheat plants. Therefore, improving the regeneration rate of wheat callus is a precondition for developing genetic engineering-based wheat breeding approaches. In the present study, we explored the molecular mechanism of wheat regeneration and aimed to establish an efficient system for transgenic wheat. We isolated and identified a regeneration-related gene, TaTCP-1 (KC808517), from wheat cultivar Lunxuan 987. Sequence analysis revealed that the ORF of TaTCP-1 was 1623bp long encoding 540 amino acids. The TaTCP-1 gene was expressed in various wheat tissues. Further, the level of TaTCP-1 expression was higher in calli and increased gradually with increasing callus induction time, reaching a peak on the 11th day after induction. Moreover, the expression level of TaTCP-1 was higher in embryogenic calli than in non-embryonic calli. The TaTCP-1 protein was localized to the nucleus, cytoplasm, and cell membrane. The callus regeneration rate of wheat plants transformed with TaTCP-1-RNAi reduced by 85.09%. In contrast, it increased by 14.43% in plants overexpressing TaTCP-1 . In conclusion, our results showed that TaTCP-1 played a vital role in promoting wheat regeneration, and regulated the somatic embryogenesis of wheat. These results may have implications in the genetic engineering of wheat for improved wheat production."
"28765985","articletitle","Translational genomics of grain size regulation in wheat."
"28765985","abstracttext_key message","Identifying and mapping grain size candidate genes in the wheat genome greatly empowers reverse genetics approaches to improve grain yield potential of wheat. Grain size (GS) or grain weight is believed to be a major driving force for further improvement of wheat yield. Although the large, polyploid genome of wheat poses an obstacle to identifying GS determinants using map-based cloning, a translational genomics approach using GS regulators identified in the model plants rice and Arabidopsis as candidate genes appears to be effective and supports a hypothesis that a conserved genetic network regulates GS in rice and wheat. In this review, we summarize the progress in the studies on GS in the model plants and wheat and identify 45 GS candidate loci in the wheat genome. In silico mapping of these GS loci in the diploid wheat and barley genomes showed (1) several gene families amplified in the wheat lineage, (2) a significant number of the GS genes located in the proximal regions surrounding the centromeres, and (3) more than half of candidate genes to be negative regulators, or their expression negatively related by microRNAs. Identifying and mapping the wheat GS gene homologs will not only facilitate candidate gene analysis, but also open the door to improving wheat yield using reverse genetics approaches by mining desired alleles in landraces and wild ancestors and to developing novel germplasm by TILLING and genome editing technologies."

After locating Ror1 to the centromeric region of barley chromosome 1H using a combined amplified fragment length polymorphism/restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) approach, sequences of RFLP probes from this chromosome region of barley and corresponding genome regions from the related grass species oat (Avena spp.), wheat, and Triticum monococcum were used to develop STS markers. Primers based on the RFLP probe sequences were used to polymerase chain reaction-amplify and directly sequence homologous DNA stretches from each of four parents that were used for mapping. Over 28,000 bp from 22 markers were compared. In addition to one insertion/deletion of at least 2.0 kb, 79 small unique sequence polymorphisms were observed, including 65 single nucleotide substitutions, two dinucleotide substitutions, 11 insertion/deletions, and one 5-bp/10-bp exchange. The frequency of polymorphism between any two barley lines ranged from 0.9 to 3.0 kb, and was greatest for comparisons involving an Ethiopian landrace. Haplotype structure was observed in the marker sequences over distances of several hundred basepairs. Polymorphisms in 16 STSs were used to generate genetic markers, scored by restriction enzyme digestion or by direct sequencing. Over 2,300 segregants from three populations were used in Ror1 linkage analysis, mapping Ror1 to a 0.2- to 0.5-cM marker interval. We discuss the implications of sequence haplotypes and STS markers for the generation of high-density maps in cereals."

"15632113","abstracttext","A novel gene sequence, with two exons and one intron, encoding a metallothionein (MT) has been identified in durum wheat Triticum durum cv. Balcali85 genomic DNA. Multiple alignment analyses on the cDNA and the translated protein sequences showed that T. durum MT (dMT) can be classified as a type 1 MT. dMT has three Cys-X-Cys motifs in each of the N- and C-terminal domains and a 42-residue-long hinge region devoid of cysteines. dMT was overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein (GSTdMT), and bacteria expressing the fusion protein showed increased tolerance to cadmium in the growth medium compared with controls. Purified GSTdMT was characterized by SDS- and native-PAGE, size exclusion chromatography, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. It was shown that the recombinant protein binds 4 +/- 1 mol of cadmium/mol of protein and has a high tendency to form stable oligomeric structures. The structure of GSTdMT and dMT was investigated by synchrotron x-ray solution scattering and computational methods. X-ray scattering measurements indicated a strong tendency for GSTdMT to form dimers and trimers in solution and yielded structural models that were compatible with a stable dimeric form in which dMT had an extended conformation. Results of homology modeling and ab initio solution scattering approaches produced an elongated dMT structure with a long central hinge region. The predicted model and those obtained from x-ray scattering are in agreement and suggest that dMT may be involved in functions other than metal detoxification."

"12582867","abstracttext","Genes for puroindoline-a (Pin-a), puroindoline-b (Pin-b) and grain-softness proteins (GSP) have been shown to be linked to the dominant Ha locus responsible for the soft texture of the grain. Though linkage has been demonstrated of the puroindoline genes to the Ha locus, there is no clear evidence that puroindoline content is the product of the gene Ha. A segregating population of 115 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) originating from a cross between the hexaploid Synthetic wheat ( Triticum durum x Aegilops tauschii, W 7984) and the cultivar 'Opata' (M 85) was studied in two different experimental years to detect Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) for three traits: grain hardness (Hard), puroindoline-a (Pin-a) and puroindoline-b (Pin-b) contents. The detection of QTLs was performed using marker linear regression. Negative correlation coefficients (-0.86 and -0.80) were identified between grain hardness and puroindoline content (a and b, respectively) on data obtained in 1996. Results obtained in 1999 confirmed the negative correlation between Hard and Pin-a (-0.73); however a positive correlation coefficient was found with Pin-b content (0.41). Total phenotypic variation explained by each QTL was calculated (R2). For each of the Hard, Pin-a and Pin-b traits one major QTL was detected on the short arm of chromosome 5D, located close to the mta9 allele (puroindoline-a). For the first year (1996) the QTL in this region explained around 63% of the phenotypic variability in grain hardness, 77% in Pin-a and 45% in Pin-b contents. These values were confirmed in trials carried out in 1999 with a R2 value of 0.71, 0.72 and 0.25 for Hard, Pin-a and Pin-b, respectively. In 1996 and 1999 a second major QTL was detected for grain hardness on the long arm of the same chromosome. Present results indicate that it cannot be definitely concluded that puroindoline content represents a linear explanation for variations in grain hardness."
"18317935","articletitle","Identification of candidate CBF genes for the frost tolerance locus Fr-Am2 in Triticum monococcum."
"18317935","abstracttext","A cluster of eleven CBF genes was recently mapped to the Frost resistance-2 (Fr-Am2) locus on chromosome 5 of diploid wheat (Triticum monococcum) using a cross between frost tolerant accession G3116 and frost sensitive DV92. The Fr-Am2 locus was mapped at the peak of two overlapping quantitative trait loci (QTL), one for frost survival and the other for differential expression of the cold regulated gene COR14b. Seven lines with recombination events within the CBF cluster were used to identify CBF candidate genes for these QTL. The lines carrying the critical recombination events were tested for whole plant frost survival and for differential transcript levels of cold induced COR14b and DHN5 genes. The strongest effect for these traits was associated to the linked TmCBF12, TmCBF14 and TmCBF15 genes, with the G3116 allele conferring improved frost tolerance and higher levels of COR14b and DHN5 transcript at mild cold temperatures (12-15 degrees C) than the DV92 allele. Comparison of CBF protein sequences revealed that the DV92 TmCBF12 protein contains a deletion of five amino acids in the AP2 DNA binding domain. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA) confirmed that the protein encoded by this allele cannot bind to the CRT/DRE (C-repeat/ dehydration-responsive element) motif present in the promoters of several cold induced genes. A smaller effect on frost tolerance was mapped to the distal group of CBF genes including TmCBF16. Transcript levels of TmCBF16, as well as those of TmCBF12 and TmCBF15 were up-regulated at mild cold temperatures in G3116 but not in DV92. Higher threshold induction temperatures can result in earlier initiation of the cold acclimation process and better resistance to subsequent freezing temperatures. The non-functional TmCBF12 allele in DV92 can also contribute to its lower frost tolerance."

"18470193","abstracttext","First division restitution (FDR) in intergeneric Triticeae hybrids provides an important meiotic mechanism for the production of amphidiploids without the use of colchicine and similar chemicals. The genetic controls of FDR were investigated by examining microsporogenesis and fertility in F1 hybrids of two- and three-way crosses of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) cultivars Langdon (LDN) and Golden Ball (GB), 'Gazelle' rye (Secale cereale L.), and one accession (RL5286) of Aegilops squarrosa L. The results from two-way crosses indicated that the first meiotic division varied, depending on the hybrid. GB crossed with Ae. squarrosa developed tripolar spindles and prevented congregation of chromosomes at the equatorial plate. The hybrid of GB with rye had a delayed first division. But, the hybrids of LDN with both Ae. squarrosa and rye had a high frequency of FDR. Analysis from the three-way crosses indicated that inheritance in rye crosses differed from those with Ae. squarrosa. FDR segregated in a 1:1 ratio in the rye cross, suggesting that the FDR is controlled by a single gene from LDN. However, FDR fit a 1:3 ratio in the three-way crosses with Ae. squarrosa. Cytological data suggested that tripolar spindles are a major factor preventing FDR in Ae. squarrosa crosses. Some progenies from the three-way cross with rye had a high frequency of monads that resulted from second division failure of FDR cells."

"18539775","abstracttext","The switch from vegetative to reproductive growth is marked by the termination of vegetative development and the adoption of floral identity by the shoot apical meristem (SAM). This process is called the floral transition. To elucidate the molecular determinants involved in this process, we performed genome-wide RNA expression profiling on maize (Zea mays) shoot apices at vegetative and early reproductive stages using massively parallel signature sequencing technology. Profiling revealed significant up-regulation of two maize MADS-box (ZMM) genes, ZMM4 and ZMM15, after the floral transition. ZMM4 and ZMM15 map to duplicated regions on chromosomes 1 and 5 and are linked to neighboring MADS-box genes ZMM24 and ZMM31, respectively. This gene order is syntenic with the vernalization1 locus responsible for floral induction in winter wheat (Triticum monococcum) and similar loci in other cereals. Analyses of temporal and spatial expression patterns indicated that the duplicated pairs ZMM4-ZMM24 and ZMM15-ZMM31 are coordinately activated after the floral transition in early developing inflorescences. More detailed analyses revealed ZMM4 expression initiates in leaf primordia of vegetative shoot apices and later increases within elongating meristems acquiring inflorescence identity. Expression analysis in late flowering mutants positioned all four genes downstream of the floral activators indeterminate1 (id1) and delayed flowering1 (dlf1). Overexpression of ZMM4 leads to early flowering in transgenic maize and suppresses the late flowering phenotype of both the id1 and dlf1 mutations. Our results suggest ZMM4 may play roles in both floral induction and inflorescence development."

"17287973","abstracttext","A monosomic addition line of Aegilops tauschii chromosome 1D in Triticum durum cv. PBW114 was produced in 1990. This line was self-pollinated and maintained for several generations while following the presence of chromosome 1D carrying the gene for red glume color. Cytological analysis indicated that two of the three derivative lines had substitution of chromosome 1D for 1A and another had substitution of chromosome 1D for 1B. One of these lines carried a pair of small chromosomes in addition to the 1D chromosome. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of the derived lines showed the presence of high-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenin encoded by the Glu-D1 locus. The small chromosome found in one of the lines had nearly regular pairing and transmission to daughter nuclei. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and analysis of molecular markers indicated that the small chromosome was derived from the short arm of chromosome 1A and carried the Glu-A3 locus. Microsatellite mapping based on the deletion bin map revealed that the small chromosome had terminal deletions on both the terminal and centromeric sides. The line with the small chromosome showed improvement of the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-sedimentation value as compared to parent durum. However, the increase in SDS-sedimentation value was more significant in the substitution line of chromosome 1D for 1A without the small chromosome. These facts suggest a negative effect of the Glu-A3 locus on dough strength. The sequence of the Glu-D1 locus from these lines showed that the HMW glutenin subunits were Ae. tauschii specific 2(t) + T2, which were previously found to be associated with poor rheological properties and bread loaf volume in synthetic hexaploid wheat by other workers. Thus, the significant improvement in the SDS-sedimentation value of the substitution line of 1D for 1A suggests that the absence of the negative effect of chromosome 1A on quality is more important than the presence of Glu-D1 of Ae. tauschii."

"21423406","abstracttext","Genes encoding proteins that contain the universal stress protein (USP) domain are known to provide bacteria, archaea, fungi, protozoa, and plants with the ability to respond to a plethora of environmental stresses. Specifically in plants, drought tolerance is a desirable phenotype. However, limited focused and organized functional genomic datasets exist on drought-responsive plant USP genes to facilitate their characterization. The overall objective of the investigation was to identify diverse plant universal stress proteins and Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) responsive to water-deficit stress. We hypothesize that cross-database mining of functional annotations in protein and gene transcript bioinformatics resources would help identify candidate drought-responsive universal stress proteins and transcripts from multiple plant species. Our bioinformatics approach retrieved, mined and integrated comprehensive functional annotation data on 511 protein and 1561 ESTs sequences from 161 viridiplantae taxa. A total of 32 drought-responsive ESTs from 7 plant genera Glycine, Hordeum, Manihot, Medicago, Oryza, Pinus and Triticum were identified. Two Arabidopsis USP genes At3g62550 and At3g53990 that encode ATP-binding motif were up-regulated in a drought microarray dataset. Further, a dataset of 80 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) linked to 20 singletons and 47 transcript assembles was constructed. Integrating the datasets on SSRs and drought-responsive ESTs identified three drought-responsive ESTs from bread wheat (BE604157), soybean (BM887317) and maritime pine (BX682209). The SSR sequence types were CAG, ATA and AT respectively. The datasets from cross-database mining provide organized resources for the characterization of USP genes as useful targets for engineering plant varieties tolerant to unfavorable environmental conditions."

The objective of this research was to identify and map leaf, stripe and stem rust resistance loci from the French cultivar Sachem and Canadian cultivar Strongfield. A doubled haploid population from Sachem/Strongfield and parents were phenotyped for seedling reaction to leaf rust races BBG/BN and BBG/BP and adult plant response was determined in three field rust nurseries near El Batan, Obregon and Toluca, Mexico. Stripe rust response was recorded in 2009 and 2011 nurseries near Toluca and near Njoro, Kenya in 2010. Response to stem rust was recorded in field nurseries near Njoro, Kenya, in 2010 and 2011. Sachem was resistant to leaf, stripe and stem rust. A major leaf rust quantitative trait locus (QTL) was identified on chromosome 7B at Xgwm146 in Sachem. In the same region on 7B, a stripe rust QTL was identified in Strongfield. Leaf and stripe rust QTL around DArT marker wPt3451 were identified on chromosome 1B. On chromosome 2B, a significant leaf rust QTL was detected conferred by Strongfield, and at the same QTL, a Yr gene derived from Sachem conferred resistance. Significant stem rust resistance QTL were detected on chromosome 4B. Consistent interactions among loci for resistance to each rust type across nurseries were detected, especially for leaf rust QTL on 7B. Sachem and Strongfield offer useful sources of rust resistance genes for durum rust breeding."

"24226406","abstracttext","The present paper is part of a research program which aims at a quantitative analysis of the effects of light and gibberellic acid (GA3) on growth of the first foliage leaf in durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.). Since leaf growth is the combined result of the increase in cell number (cell division) and cell enlargement, the influence of light and GA3 treatment on cell division in the basal meristem of the first leaf in two cultivars, Cappelli and Creso, was investigated. Creso is a short-strawed cultivar carrying the Gai 1 gene which influences both plant height and insensitivity to applied GA3. Cell division, as measured by mitotic index, was similar in darkness, continuous red light and dichromatic irradiation (far-red plus red), while lower mitotic rates were observed under continuous far-red light: this indicates that the response of cell division is modulated by a high-irradiance reaction of phytochrome in both cultivars. The two cultivars showed different responses to blue light. In Cappelli, blue light and dichromatic irradiation (blue plus red) gave lower mitotic indices than the dark control, indicating the action of a specific blue-light-absorbing photoreceptor, whereas in Creso the response kinetics to all light regimes which included blue light were more complex. On the basis also of the results obtained with GA3 application in Cappelli, it appears that (i) the hormonal treatment is able to change the pattern of mitotic index only in the presence of the action of a blue-light receptor and (ii) the different responses of the two cultivars could be the result of different endogenous hormonal levels. The importance of the observations in relation to the data for first-leaf longitudinal growth reported in a previous paper (Baroncelli et al. 1984, Planta 160, 298-304) is discussed."

"25480445","abstracttext","The morphological features of the olfactory mucosae of Korean roe deer, Capreolus pygargus, were histologically studied using the ethmoid turbinates containing the olfactory mucosae from six roe deer (male, 2-3 years old). The ethmoid turbinates were embedded in paraffin, and histochemically evaluated in terms of the mucosal characteristics. Lectin histochemistry was performed to investigate the carbohydrate-binding specificity on the olfactory mucosa. Lectins, including Triticum vulgaris wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA-I), and soybean agglutinin (SBA) were used for the N-acetylglucosamine, fucose and N-acetylgalactosamine carbohydrate groups, respectively. Histologically, the olfactory mucosa, positioned mainly in the caudal roof of the nasal cavity, consisted of the olfactory epithelium and the lamina propria. The olfactory epithelium consisted of protein gene product (PGP) 9.5-positive olfactory receptor cells, galectin-3-positive supporting cells and basal cells. Bowman's glands in the lamina propria were stained by both the periodic acid Schiff reagent and alcian blue (pH 2.5). Two types of lectin, WGA and SBA, were labeled in free border, receptor cells, supporting cells and Bowman's glands, with the exception of basal cells, while UEA-I was labeled in free border, supporting cells and Bowman's glands, but not in receptor cells and basal cells, suggesting that carbohydrate terminals on the olfactory mucosae of roe deer vary depending on cell type. This is the first morphological study of the olfactory mucosa of the Korean roe deer to evaluate carbohydrate terminals in the olfactory mucosae."

"25724957","abstracttext","Triticum turgidum subsp. durum was grown according to four farming systems: conventional (CONV), organic with cow manure (OMAN) or green manure (OLEG), and without inputs (NOINPUT). Some chemical and technological characteristics differed between CONV and organic flours. As shown by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) analysis, OMAN and OLEG flours showed the highest number of gliadins, and OMAN flour also had the highest number of high-molecular-mass glutenins. Type I sourdoughs were prepared at the laboratory level through a back-slopping procedure, and the bacterial ecology during sourdough preparation was described by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Before fermentation, the dough made with CONV flour showed the highest bacterial diversity. Flours were variously contaminated by genera belonging to the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria. Mature sourdoughs were completely and stably dominated by lactic acid bacteria. The diversity of Firmicutes was the highest for mature sourdoughs made with organic and, especially, NOINPUT flours. Beta diversity analysis based on the weighted UniFrac distance showed differences between doughs and sourdoughs. Those made with CONV flour were separated from the other with organic flours. Lactic acid bacterium microbiota structure was qualitatively confirmed through the culturing method. As shown by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis, yeasts belonging to the genera Saccharomyces, Candida, Kazachstania, and Rhodotorula occurred in all sourdoughs. Levels of bound phenolic acids and phytase and antioxidant activities differed depending on the farming system. Mature sourdoughs were used for bread making. Technological characteristics were superior in the breads made with organic sourdoughs. The farming system is another determinant affecting the sourdough microbiota. The organic cultivation of durum wheat was reflected along the flour-sourdough fermentation-bread axis."

"28273182","abstracttext","Einkorn (Triticum monococcum L.) is A-genome diploid wheat that has a potential to become a useful model for understanding the biology and genomics in Triticeae. Unfortunately, the application of modern technologies such as genetic engineering, RNAi-based gene silencing and genome editing is not available for einkorn as there is no efficient in vitro tissue culture and plant regeneration system. In the present study an efficient and simple protocol for plant regeneration via direct or indirect somatic embryogenesis and organogenesis has been developed. Various auxins used as sole inductors in einkorn displayed low effect for morphogenesis (0-8%) and plant regeneration (1-2 shoots per explant). The addition of Daminozide, the inhibitor of biosynthesis of gibberellins, together with auxin significantly improved the formation of morphogenic structures, especially when Dicamba (51.4%) and Picloram (56.6%) were used for combination; furthermore, the simultaneous addition of cytokinin into induction medium significantly promoted in vitro performance. Among the tested cytokinins, the urea-type substances, such as TDZ and CPPU were more effective than the adenine type ones, BA and Zeatin, for the regulation of morphogenesis; especially, TDZ was more effective than CPPU for shoot formation (11.73 vs. 7.04 per regenerating callus). The highest morphogenic response of 90.2% with the production of more than 10 shoots per initial explant was observed when 3.0 mg/L Dicamba, 50.0 mg/L Daminozide and 0.25 mg/L TDZ were combined together. Along with the identification of appropriate induction medium, the optimal developmental stage for einkorn was found as partially transparent immature embryo in size of around 1.0 mm. Although in the present study the critical balance between plant growth regulators was established for einkorn only, we assume that further the proposed strategy could be successfully applied to other recalcitrant cereal species and genotypes."
"30099611","articletitle","The wheat TdRL1 is the functional homolog of the rice RSS1 and promotes plant salt stress tolerance."
"30099611","abstracttext_key message","Rice rss1 complementation assays show that wheat TdRL1 and RSS1 are true functional homologs. TdRL1 over-expression in Arabidopsis conferred salt stress tolerance and alleviated ROS accumulation. Plants have developed highly flexible adaptive responses to their ever-changing environment, which are often mediated by intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP). RICE SALT SENSITIVE 1 and Triticum durum RSS1-Like 1 protein (TdRL1) are both IDPs involved in abiotic stress responses, and possess conserved D and DEN-Boxes known to be required for post-translational degradation by the APC/C cdc20 cyclosome. To further understand their function, we performed a computational analysis to compare RSS1 and TdRL1 co-expression networks revealing common gene ontologies, among which those related to cell cycle progression and regulation of microtubule (MT) networks were over-represented. When over-expressed in Arabidopsis, TdRL1::GFP was present in dividing cells and more visible in cortical and endodermal cells of the Root Apical Meristem (RAM). Incubation with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 stabilized TdRL1::GFP expression in RAM cells showing a post-translational regulation. Moreover, immuno-cytochemical analyses of transgenic roots showed that TdRL1 was present in the cytoplasm and within the microtubular spindle of mitotic cells, while, in interphasic cells, it was rather restricted to the cytoplasm with a spotty pattern at the nuclear periphery. Interestingly in cells subjected to stress, TdRL1 was partly relocated into the nucleus. Moreover, TdRL1 transgenic lines showed increased germination rates under salt stress conditions as compared to wild type. This enhanced salt stress tolerance was associated to an alleviation of oxidative damage. Finally, when expressed in the rice rss1 mutant, TdRL1 suppressed its dwarf phenotype upon salt stress, confirming that both proteins are true functional homologs required for salt stress tolerance in cereals."

"31897516","abstracttext_key message","We discussed the most recent efforts in wheat functional genomics to discover new genes and their deployment in breeding with special emphasis on advances in Asian countries. Wheat research community is making significant progress to bridge genotype-to-phenotype gap and then applying this knowledge in genetic improvement. The advances in genomics and phenomics have intrigued wheat researchers in Asia to make best use of this knowledge in gene and trait discovery. These advancements include, but not limited to, map-based gene cloning, translational genomics, gene mapping, association genetics, gene editing and genomic selection. We reviewed more than 57 homeologous genes discovered underpinning important traits and multiple strategies used for their discovery. Further, the complementary advancements in wheat phenomics and analytical approaches to understand the genetics of wheat adaptability, resilience to climate extremes and resistance to pest and diseases were discussed. The challenge to build a gold standard reference genome sequence of bread wheat is now achieved and several de novo reference sequences from the cultivars representing different gene pools will be available soon. New pan-genome sequencing resources of wheat will strengthen the foundation required for accelerated gene discovery and provide more opportunities to practice the knowledge-based breeding."

"24232622","abstracttext","Allozyme variation in the tetraploid wild emmer wheat, Triticum dicoccoides, the progenitor of all cultivated wheats, was studied for the proteins encoded by 42 gene loci in 1815 plants representing 37 populations - 33 from Israel and 4 from Turkey - sampled in 33 localities from 1979 to 1987. The results showed that: (a) 6 loci (14%) were monomorphic in all populations, 15 loci (36%) were locally polymorphic, and 21 loci (50%) were regionally polymorphic. These results are similar to those obtained earlier on 12 Israeli populations. All polymorphic loci (except 4) displayed high local levels of polymorphism (>/ 10%). (b) The mean number of alleles per locus, A, was 1.252 (range: 1.050-1.634); the proportion of polymorphic loci per population averaged 0.220 (range: 0.050-0.415); genic diversity, He, averaged 0.059 (range: 0.002-0.119). (c) Altogether there were 119 alleles at the 42 putative loci tested, 114 of these in Israel, (d) Genetic differentiation was primarily regional and local, not clinal; 70% of the variant alleles were common (>/ 10%) and not widespread, but rather localized or sporadic, displaying an ""archipelago"" population genetics and ecology structure. The coefficients of genetic distance between populations were high and averaged D = 0.134; range: 0.018-0.297, an indication of sharp genetic differentiation over short distances, (e) Discriminant analyses differentiated Israeli from Turkish populations, and within Israel, between central and 3 marginal regions, as well as between different soil-type populations, (f) Allozymic variation comprised 40% within and 60% between populations, (g) Gametic phase disequilibria were abundant, their number being positively correlated (rs = 0.60, P<0.01) with the humidity, (h) Multilocus organization was substantive, also positively correlated with humidity, (i) Allozyme diversity, overall and at single loci, was significantly correlated with, and partly predictable by, climatic and edaphic factors, (j) The distrubition of the significant positive and negative values and the absence of autocorrelations in the correlogram revealed no similar geographic patterns across loci, eliminating migration as a prime factor of population genetic differentiation. These results suggest: (I) during the evolutionary history of wild emmer, diversifying natural selection, through climatic and edaphic factors, was a major agent of genetic structure and differentiation at both the single and multilocus levels; (II) wild emmer harbors large amounts of genetic diversity exploitable as genetic markers in sampling and abundant genetic resources utilizable for wheat improvement."
"31396255","articletitle","Identification of a Dominant Chlorosis Phenotype Through a Forward Screen of the Triticum turgidum cv. Kronos TILLING Population."
"31396255","abstracttext","Durum wheat ( Triticum turgidum ) derives from a hybridization event approximately 400,000 years ago which led to the creation of an allotetraploid genome. The evolutionary recent origin of durum wheat means that its genome has not yet been fully diploidised. As a result, many of the genes present in the durum genome act in a redundant fashion, where loss-of-function mutations must be present in both gene copies to observe a phenotypic effect. Here, we use a novel set of induced variation within the cv. Kronos TILLING population to identify a locus controlling a dominant, environmentally dependent chlorosis phenotype. We carried out a forward screen of the sequenced cv. Kronos TILLING lines for senescence phenotypes and identified a line with a dominant early senescence and chlorosis phenotype. Mutant plants contained less chlorophyll throughout their development and displayed premature flag leaf senescence. A segregating population was classified into discrete phenotypic groups and subjected to bulked-segregant analysis using exome capture followed by next-generation sequencing. This allowed the identification of a single region on chromosome 3A, Yellow Early Senescence 1 ( YES-1 ), which was associated with the mutant phenotype. While this phenotype was consistent across 4 years of field trials in the United Kingdom, the mutant phenotype was not observed when grown in Davis, CA (United States). To obtain further SNPs for fine-mapping, we isolated chromosome 3A using flow sorting and sequenced the entire chromosome. By mapping these reads against both the cv. Chinese Spring reference sequence and the cv. Kronos assembly, we could identify high-quality, novel EMS-induced SNPs in non-coding regions within YES-1 that were previously missed in the exome capture data. This allowed us to fine-map YES-1 to 4.3 Mb, containing 59 genes. Our study shows that populations containing induced variation can be sources of novel dominant variation in polyploid crop species, highlighting their importance in future genetic screens. We also demonstrate the value of using cultivar-specific genome assemblies alongside the gold-standard reference genomes particularly when working with non-coding regions of the genome. Further fine-mapping of the YES-1 locus will be pursued to identify the causal SNP underpinning this dominant, environmentally dependent phenotype."

"24522724","abstracttext_key message","Using association and linkage mapping, two SNP markers closely linked to the SBWMV resistance gene on chromosome 5D were identified and can be used to select the gene in breeding. Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV) disease is a serious viral disease of winter wheat growing areas worldwide. SBWMV infection can significantly reduce grain yield up to 80 %. Developing resistant wheat cultivars is the only feasible strategy to reduce the losses. In this study, wheat Infinium iSelect Beadchips with 9 K wheat SNPs were used to genotype an association mapping population of 205 wheat accessions. Six new SNPs from two genes were identified to be significantly associated with the gene for SBWMV resistance on chromosome 5D. The SNPs and Xgwm469, an SSR marker that has been reported to be associated with the gene, were mapped close to the gene using F6-derived recombinant inbred lines from the cross between a resistant parent 'Heyne' and a susceptible parent 'Trego'. Two representative SNPs, wsnp_CAP11_c209_198467 and wsnp_JD_c4438_5568170, from the two linked genes in wheat were converted into KBioscience Competitive Allele-Specific Polymerase assays and can be easily used in marker-assisted selection to improve wheat resistance to SBWMV in breeding."

"11244111","abstracttext","Hexaploid wheat is a young polyploid species and represents a good model to study mechanisms of gene evolution after polyploidization. Recent studies at the scale of the whole genome have suggested rapid genomic changes after polyploidization but so far the rearrangements that have occurred in terms of gene content and organization have not been analyzed at the microlevel in wheat. Here, we have isolated members of a receptor kinase (Lrk) gene family in hexaploid and diploid wheat, Aegilops tauschii, and barley (Hordeum vulgare). Phylogenetic analysis has allowed us to establish evolutionary relationships (orthology versus paralogy) between the different members of this gene family in wheat as well as with Lrk genes from barley. It also demonstrated that the sequences of the homoeologous Lrk genes evolved independently after polyploidization. In addition, we found evidence for gene loss during the evolution of wheat and barley. Analysis of large genomic fragments isolated from nonorthologous Lrk loci showed a high conservation of the gene content and gene organization at these loci on the homoeologous group 1 chromosomes of wheat and barley. Finally, sequence comparison of two paralogous fragments of chromosome 1B showed a large number of local events (sequence duplications, deletions, and insertions), which reveal rearrangements and mechanisms for genome enlargement at the microlevel."

"28251756","abstracttext","Parastagonospora nodorum is an important pathogen of wheat. The contribution of secondary metabolites to this pathosystem is poorly understood. A biosynthetic gene cluster (SNOG_08608-08616) has been shown to be upregulated during the late stage of P. nodorum wheat leaf infection. The gene cluster shares several homologues with the Cercospora nicotianae CTB gene cluster encoding the biosynthesis of cercosporin. Activation of the gene cluster by overexpression (OE) of the transcription factor gene (SNOG_08609) in P. nodorum resulted in the production of elsinochrome C, a perelyenequinone phytotoxin structurally similar to cercosporin. Heterologous expression of the polyketide synthase gene elcA from the gene cluster in Aspergillus nidulans resulted in the production of the polyketide precursor nortoralactone common to the cercosporin pathway. Elsinochrome C could be detected on wheat leaves infected with P. nodorum, but not in the elcA disruption mutant. The compound was shown to exhibit necrotic activity on wheat leaves in a light-dependent manner. Wheat seedling infection assays showed that ΔelcA exhibited reduced virulence compared with wild type, while infection by an OE strain overproducing elsinochrome C resulted in larger lesions on leaves. These data provided evidence that elsinochrome C contributes to the virulence of P. nodorum against wheat."

In this work, we identified and characterized the EFPL gene TaEPFL1 from the wheat pistillody mutant HTS-1. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis indicated that TaEPFL1 belongs to the EPFL1 gene. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that the TaEPFL1 gene is expressed at an abnormally high level in pistillody stamens compared with that in pistils and stamens. Heterologous expression of the TaEPFL1 gene in Arabidopsis caused shortened filaments and pedicels and might reduce the level of AtACO2 gene expression. These results suggest that TaEPFL1 plays an important role in the development of stamen and that overexpression of TaEPFL1 results in abnormal stamens. We deduced that the overexpression of the TaEPFL1 gene may contribute to the homeotic transformation of stamens into pistils or pistil-like structures in wheat. These data offer insights into the molecular mechanism of pistillody mutation in wheat."

Sequence comparisons show that the wheat mt and cp tRNA(Trp) genes are 97% homologous. On the wheat cp DNA, a tRNA(UGGPro) gene was found 139 bp upstream of the cp tRNA(Trp) gene. On the wheat mt DNA, a sequence of 23 nucleotides completely homologous with the 3' end of this cp tRNA(Pro) gene was found 136 bp upstream of the mt tRNA(Trp) gene, but there is only 38% homology between cp and mt wheat genomes in the intergenic regions. The overall organization of this region in the chloroplast genome (a tRNA(Trp) gene separated by about 140 bp from a tRNA(Pro) gene) is also found in the mitochondrial genome, suggesting that this mitochondrial fragment might have originated from a chloroplast DNA insertion. A comparison of the genes and of the intergenic regions located between the tRNA(Trp) gene and the tRNA(Pro) (or partial tRNA(Pro)) gene shows that there is an almost complete conservation of these sequences in the mitochondrial DNA of wheat and maize, whereas wheat mt and cp intergenic regions show more sequence divergence. Wheat mt tRNA(Trp) gene is encoded by the main mt genome (accounted for by the master chromosome) but, in the case of maize mitochondria, this gene was found to be encoded by the 2.3 kb linear plasmid, indicating that this plasmid is not dispensable in maize mitochondria."

"24407610","abstracttext","Cultivars of T. aestivum crossed onto two lines with male sterility induced by the cytoplasm of T. timopheevi gave a high level of restoration in the F1 generation.

The possible association between this gene and mildew resistance or some other desirable character derived from 'CI 12633', a common ancestor of the cultivars used, is discussed."

"15514442","abstracttext","The polyploid nature of wheat is a key characteristic of the plant. Full-length complementary DNAs (cDNAs) provide essential information that can be used to annotate the genes and provide a functional analysis of these genes and their products. We constructed a full-length cDNA library derived from young spikelets of common wheat, and obtained 24056 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from both ends of the cDNA clones. These ESTs were grouped into 3605 contigs using the phrap method, representing expressed loci from each of the three genomes. Using BLAST, 3605 contigs were grouped into 1902 gene clusters, showing that loci of the three genomes are not always expressed. A homology search of these gene clusters against a wheat EST database (15964 gene clusters) and a rice full-length cDNA database (21447 gene clusters) revealed that a quarter of the wheat full-length cDNAs were novel. A protein database of Arabidopsis was used to examine the functional classification of these gene clusters. The GC-content in the 5 -UTR region of wheat cDNAs was compared to that of rice. Forty-three genes (3.5% of wheat cDNAs homologous to those of rice) possessed distinct GC-content in the 5 -UTR region, suggesting different breeding behaviors of wheat and rice."

"12582614","abstracttext","The casein kinase CK2 is one of the major multifunctional protein kinases in cells that is expressed ubiquitously and is essential for survival. The alpha-subunit of CK2 is thought to be involved in light-regulated gene expression and rhythmic expression of genes by circadian rhythm in plants. The rice chromosome-3 region containing the photoperiod-response Hd6 gene, an orthologue of the CK2alpha genes of Arabidopsis and maize, is in synteny with the wheat chromosome-5A Vrn-A1 region. This evidence proposes two possibilities, first the wheat Vrn-A1 is an orthologue of the rice CK2alpha, and second the wheat CK2alpha which has not yet been identified is located independently but tightly linked to Vrn-A1. To clarify whether the wheat CK2alpha gene is conserved in the Vrn-A1 region and to elucidate the above two possibilities, we attempted to isolate this gene from the wheat cDNA library and to map it on the chromosome-5A region that is syntenous to the rice Hd6 region. The isolated cDNA clone showed an extremely high homology with the Arabidopsis CK2alpha gene. Using this clone as a probe genomic Southern-blot analyses of the aneuploid lines available in Chinese Spring assigned the wheat homologue of CK2alpha to the long arm of chromosome 5A. Furthermore, a linkage analysis using an F(2) population having recombination in the Vrn-A1 region revealed that the wheat CK2alpha, designated as tck2a, is tightly linked to Vrn-A1 by 1.1 cM"

"23177146","abstracttext","Wheat stripe rust is a devastating disease in many regions of the world. In wheat, 49 resistance genes for stripe rust have been officially documented, but only three genes are cloned, including the race-specific resistance Yr10 candidate gene (Yr10(CG)) and slow-rusting genes Lr34/Yr18 (hereafter designated as Yr18) and Yr36. In this study, we developed gene-specific markers for these genes and used them to screen a collection of 659 wheat accessions, including 485 Chinese cultivars. Thirteen percent and eleven percent of the tested Chinese cultivars were positive for the markers for Yr10(CG) and Yr18(RH) (the resistant haplotype of Yr18), respectively, but none were positive for the Yr36 marker. Since there is a limited use of the Yr10 gene in Chinese wheat, the relatively high frequency of wheat varieties with the Yr10(CG) marker suggests that the identity of the Yr10 gene is unknown. With regards to the Yr18 gene, 29% of the tested cultivars that are used in the Middle and Lower Yangtze Valleys' winter wheat zone were positive for Yr18(RH) markers. A non-functional allele of Yr18(RH) was identified in 'Mingxian 169', a commonly used susceptible check for studying stripe rust. The data presented here will provide useful information for marker-assisted selection for wheat stripe rust resistance."
"30312356","articletitle","A wheat cytochrome P450 enhances both resistance to deoxynivalenol and grain yield."
"30312356","abstracttext","The mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) serves as a plant disease virulence factor for the fungi Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum during the development of Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease on wheat. A wheat cytochrome P450 gene from the subfamily CYP72A, TaCYP72A, was cloned from wheat cultivar CM82036. TaCYP72A was located on chromosome 3A with homeologs present on 3B and 3D of the wheat genome. Using gene expression studies, we showed that TaCYP72A variants were activated in wheat spikelets as an early response to F. graminearum, and this activation was in response to the mycotoxic Fusarium virulence factor deoxynivalenol (DON). Virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) studies in wheat heads revealed that this gene family contributes to DON resistance. VIGS resulted in more DON-induced discoloration of spikelets, as compared to mock VIGS treatment. In addition to positively affecting DON resistance, TaCYP72A also had a positive effect on grain number. VIGS of TaCYP72A genes reduced grain number by more than 59%. Thus, we provide evidence that TaCYP72A contributes to host resistance to DON and conclude that this gene family warrants further assessment as positive contributors to both biotic stress resistance and grain development in wheat."
"10092181","articletitle","Regulation by biotic and abiotic stress of a wheat germin gene encoding oxalate oxidase, a H2O2-producing enzyme."
"10092181","abstracttext","Germins and germin-like proteins (GLPs) constitute a ubiquitous family of plant proteins that seem to be involved in many developmental and stress-related processes. Wheat germin has been extensively studied at the biochemical level: it is found in the apoplast and the cytoplasm of germinating embryo cells and it has oxalate oxidase activity (EC 1.2.3.4). Germin synthesis can also be induced in adult wheat leaves by auxins and by a fungal pathogen but it remains to be determined whether the same gene is involved in developmental, hormonal and stress response. In this work, we have studied the expression of one of the wheat germin genes, named gf-2.8, in wheat as well as in transgenic tobacco plants transformed with either this intact gene or constructs with GUS driven by its promoter. This has allowed us to demonstrate that expression of this single gene is both developmentally and pathogen-regulated. In addition, we show that expression of the wheat gf-2.8 germin gene is also stimulated by some abiotic stresses, especially the heavy metal ions Cd2+, Cu2+ and Co2+. Several chemicals involved in stress signal transduction pathways were also tested: only polyamines were shown to stimulate expression of this gene. Because regulation of the wheat gf-2.8 germin gene is complex and because its product results in developmental and stress-related release of hydrogen peroxide in the apoplast, it is likely that it plays an important role in several aspects of plant growth and defence mechanisms."
"19769576","articletitle","Two different CC-NBS-LRR genes are required for Lr10-mediated leaf rust resistance in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat."
"19769576","abstracttext","Comparative study of disease resistance genes in crop plants and their relatives provides insight on resistance gene function, evolution and diversity. Here, we studied the allelic diversity of the Lr10 leaf rust resistance gene, a CC-NBS-LRR coding gene originally isolated from hexaploid wheat, in 20 diploid and tetraploid wheat lines. Besides a gene in the tetraploid wheat variety 'Altar' that is identical to the hexaploid wheat Lr10, two additional, functional resistance alleles showing sequence diversity were identified by virus-induced gene silencing in tetraploid wheat lines. In contrast to most described NBS-LRR proteins, the N-terminal CC domain of LR10 was found to be under strong diversifying selection. A second NBS-LRR gene at the Lr10 locus, RGA2, was shown through silencing to be essential for Lr10 function. Interestingly, RGA2 showed much less sequence diversity than Lr10. These data demonstrate allelic diversity of functional genes at the Lr10 locus in tetraploid wheat, and these new genes can now be analyzed for agronomic relevance. Lr10-based resistance is highly unusual both in its dependence on two, only distantly, related CC-NBS-LRR proteins, as well as in the pattern of diversifying selection in the N-terminal domain. This indicates a new and complex molecular mechanism of pathogen detection and signal transduction."

"26694368","abstracttext","The artificial gene D6D encoding the enzyme ∆⁶desaturase was designed and synthesized using the sequence of the same gene from the fungus Thamnidium elegans. The original start codon was replaced by the signal sequence derived from the wheat gene for high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit and the codon usage was completely changed for optimal expression in wheat. Synthesized artificial D6D gene was delivered into plants of the spring wheat line CY-45 and the gene itself, as well as transcribed D6D mRNA were confirmed in plants of T₀ and T₁ generations. The desired product of the wheat genetic modification by artificial D6D gene was the γ-linolenic acid. Its presence was confirmed in mature grains of transgenic wheat plants in the amount 0.04%-0.32% (v/v) of the total amount of fatty acids. Both newly synthesized γ-linolenic acid and stearidonic acid have been detected also in leaves, stems, roots, awns, paleas, rachillas, and immature grains of the T₁ generation as well as in immature and mature grains of the T₂ generation. Contents of γ-linolenic acid and stearidonic acid varied in range 0%-1.40% (v/v) and 0%-1.53% (v/v) from the total amount of fatty acids, respectively. This approach has opened the pathway of desaturation of fatty acids and production of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids in wheat."
"16357197","articletitle","Analysis and mapping of randomly chosen bacterial artificial chromosome clones from hexaploid bread wheat."
"16357197","abstracttext","The current view of wheat genome composition is that genes are compartmentalized into gene-rich and gene-poor regions. This model can be tested by analyzing randomly selected bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones for gene content, followed by placement of these BACs onto physical and genetic maps. Map localization could be difficult for BACs that consist entirely of repeated elements. We therefore developed a technique where repeat junctions are used to generate unique markers. Four BAC clones from hexaploid wheat variety Chinese Spring were randomly selected and sequenced at 4- to 6-fold redundancy. About 50% of the BAC sequences corresponded to previously identified repeats, mainly LTR-retrotransposons, whereas most of the remaining DNA consisted of sequences with unknown origin or function. The average gene content was <1%, although each BAC contained one or two identified genes. Repeat boundaries were amplified and used to map each clone to a chromosome arm. Extrapolation from wheat-rice comparative knowledge suggests that three of the four BAC clones originate from ""gene-rich"" regions of the wheat genome. Nevertheless, because these BACs carry only a single gene (two BACs) or two genes (one BAC), the predicted gene density is approximately 1 gene per 75 kb, which is considerably lower than previously estimated gene densities (one gene per 5-20 kb) for gene-rich regions in wheat. This analysis of randomly selected wheat BAC clones suggests that genes are more evenly distributed in wheat than previously believed and substantiates the need for large-scale random BAC sequencing to determine wheat genome organization."
"12879254","articletitle","Genetic mapping of Dn7, a rye gene conferring resistance to the Russian wheat aphid in wheat."
"12879254","abstracttext","The Russian wheat aphid is a significant pest problem in wheat and barley in North America. Genetic resistance in wheat is the most effective and economical means to control the damage caused by the aphid. Dn7 is a rye gene located on chromosome 1RS that confers resistance to the Russian wheat aphid. The gene was previously transferred from rye into a wheat background via a 1RS/1BL translocation. This study was conducted to genetically map Dn7 and to characterize the type of resistance the gene confers. The resistant line '94M370' was crossed with a susceptible wheat cultivar that also contains a pair of 1RS/1BL translocation chromosomes. The F(2) progeny from this cross segregated for resistance in a ratio of 3 resistant: 1 susceptible, indicating a single dominant gene. One-hundred and eleven RFLP markers previously mapped on wheat chromosomes 1A, 1B and 1D, barley chromosome 1H and rye chromosome 1R, were used to screen the parents for polymorphism. A genetic map containing six markers linked to Dn7, encompassing 28.2 cM, was constructed. The markers flanking Dn7 were Xbcd1434 and XksuD14, which mapped 1.4 cM and 7.4 cM from Dn7, respectively. Dn7 confers antixenosis, and provides a higher level of resistance than that provided by Dn4. The applications of Dn7 and the linked markers in wheat breeding are discussed."

"24688294","abstracttext","WRKY transcription factors have been extensively characterized in the past 20 years, but in wheat, studies on WRKY genes and their function are lagging behind many other species. To explore the function of wheat WRKY genes, we identified a TaWRKY68 gene from a common wheat cultivar. It encodes a protein comprising 313 amino acids which harbors 19 conserved motifs or active sites. Gene expression patterns were determined by analyzing microarray data of TaWRKY68 in wheat and of orthologous genes from maize, rice and barley using Genevestigator. TaWRKY68 orthologs were identified and clustered using DELTA-BLAST and COBALT programs available at NCBI. The results showed that these genes, which are expressed in all tissues tested, had relatively higher levels in the roots and were up-regulated in response to biotic stresses. Bioinformatics results were confirmed by RT-PCR experiments using wheat plants infected by Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Blumeria graminis, or treated with Deoxynivalenol, a Fusarium graminearum-induced mycotoxin in wheat or barley. In summary, TaWRKY68 functions differ during plant developmental stages and might be representing a hub gene function in wheat responses to various biotic stresses. It was also found that including data from major cereal genes in the bioinformatics analysis gave more accurate and comprehensive predictions of wheat gene functions."

We recently constructed the first physical map of a wheat chromosome (3B). However gene mapping is still laborious in wheat because of high redundancy between the three homoeologous genomes. In contrast, in the closely related diploid species, barley, numerous gene-based markers have been developed.

"16260473","abstracttext","The application of a new gene-based strategy for sequencing the wheat mitochondrial genome shows its structure to be a 452 528 bp circular molecule, and provides nucleotide-level evidence of intra-molecular recombination. Single, reciprocal and double recombinant products, and the nucleotide sequences of the repeats that mediate their formation have been identified. The genome has 55 genes with exons, including 35 protein-coding, 3 rRNA and 17 tRNA genes. Nucleotide sequences of seven wheat genes have been determined here for the first time. Nine genes have an exon-intron structure. Gene amplification responsible for the production of multicopy mitochondrial genes, in general, is species-specific, suggesting the recent origin of these genes. About 16, 17, 15, 3.0 and 0.2% of wheat mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) may be of genic (including introns), open reading frame, repetitive sequence, chloroplast and retro-element origin, respectively. The gene order of the wheat mitochondrial gene map shows little synteny to the rice and maize maps, indicative that thorough gene shuffling occurred during speciation. Almost all unique mtDNA sequences of wheat, as compared with rice and maize mtDNAs, are redundant DNA. Features of the gene-based strategy are discussed, and a mechanistic model of mitochondrial gene amplification is proposed."

"18944773","abstracttext","ABSTRACT The fungus Pyrenophora tritici-repentis produces a toxin (Ptr ToxA) that causes rapid cell necrosis in sensitive wheat genotypes. A single recessive gene (tsn1) on chromosome 5BL in common wheat confers insensitivity to this toxin. Our objectives were to analyze the allelic relationships of genotypes that have shown insensitivity to a P. tritici-repentis necrosis-inducing toxin, map the gene for insensitivity to the necrosis-inducing factor produced by P. tritici-repentis in a durum wheat population, and determine the reaction to P. tritici-repentis of aneuploid genotypes that do not contain the gene. Greenhouse-grown plants of seven populations from crosses of insensitive genotypes; an F(2) population of durum wheat; and 'Chinese Spring' aneuploid, substitution, and deletion lines were infiltrated with Ptr ToxA. All crosses involving insensitive genotypes failed to produce sensitive progeny, indicating that the same gene is present in these genotypes. The gene for insensitivity in the durum population was mapped to the same region on 5BL as in common wheat using restriction fragment length polymorphism markers. 'Chinese Spring', its homoeologous group 5 nullisomic-tetrasomic stocks, and 5BL deletion lines were insensitive to the toxin. Substitution of a 5B chromosome from sensitive genotypes into 'Chinese Spring' resulted in sensitivity. Therefore, insensitivity is not conferred by a gene product per se, but rather conferred by absence of a gene for sensitivity."

RNA editing of the mitochondrial nad6 transcript was studied by cDNA sequencing. Twelve edited sites were identified at the same positions as those already identified in the wheat mitochondria nad6 transcript.

TaPK3 has high sequence homology (97% similarity with some sequence diversity at the 3' end) to the wheat PKABA1 protein kinase mRNA, which is upregulated by cold-temperature treatment, dehydration and abscisic acid (ABA). Use of a TaPK3 gene-specific probe has revealed that TaPK3 is differentially expressed with respect to PKABA1. TaPK3 mRNA accumulates in greening shoot tissue of wheat, but is not affected by dehydration, cold-temperature treatment or ABA. Based on sequence and expression differences, we conclude that expression of the PKABA1-like protein kinases is not limited to stress responses."

Russian wheat aphid populations from Hungary, Russia, and Syria have previously been identified as virulent to D. noxia (Dn) 4, the gene in all Russian wheat aphid-resistant cultivars produced in Colorado. However, the virulence of Russian wheat aphid populations from central Europe, North Africa, and South America to existing Dn genes has not been assessed. Experiments with plants containing several different Dn genes demonstrated that populations from Chile, the Czech Republic, and Ethiopia are also virulent to Dn4. The Czech population was also virulent to plants containing the Dnx gene in wheat plant introduction PI220127. The Ethiopian population was also virulent to plants containing the Dny gene in the Russian wheat aphid-resistant 'Stanton' produced in Kansas. The Chilean and Ethiopian populations were unaffected by the antibiosis resistance in Dn4 plants. There were significantly more nymphs of the Chilean population on plants of Dn4 than on Dn6 plants at both 18 and 23 d postinfestation, and the Ethiopian population attained a significantly greater weight on Dn4 plants than on plants containing Dn5 or Dn6. These newly characterized virulent Russian wheat aphid populations pose a distinct threat to existing or proposed wheat cultivars possessing Dn4."

This study analyzed expression profiles of five potential reference genes selected and sequenced during RNA sequencing experiments. The expression of genes coding for actin and ribosomal protein L27 was comparatively less variable in RWA fed on different wheat hosts.

Southern blot analysis suggests that six copies of the PetF gene are present in the wheat haploid genome. Northern blot analysis has shown that the genes are both developmentally and light regulated in wheat seedlings and provides evidence that a circadian rhythm regulates the steady-state levels of ferredoxin transcripts. The intact wheat gene and several chimeric constructs, containing portions of the 5'-upstream region fused to the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene, have been introduced into tobacco plants, but levels of beta-glucuronidase activity above background were not detected, suggesting that the 5'-upstream region is unable to function as a promoter in tobacco plants."

"23205963","abstracttext","Introgression of sequences from crop species in wild relatives is of fundamental and practical concern. Here, we address gene flow between cultivated wheat and its widespread polyploid relative, Aegilops triuncialis, using 12 EST-SSR markers mapped on wheat chromosomes. The presence of wheat diagnostic alleles in natural populations of the barbed goatgrass growing in proximity to cultivated fields highlights that substantial gene flow occurred when both species coexisted. Furthermore, loci from the A subgenome of wheat were significantly less introgressed than sequences from other subgenomes, indicating differential introgression into Ae. triuncialis. Gene flow between such species sharing nonhomeologous chromosomes addresses the evolutionary outcomes of hybridization and may be important for efficient gene containment."

"32552347","abstracttext","As stress-inducible proteins, dehydrins exert functional protective role by alleviating the cell damage when plants are suffering from the stresses. However, the upstream regulatory mechanism of these proteins is not very clear. To unravel the regulatory mechanism of dehydrin, a screen of wheat cDNA library from cold and PEG-treated wheat seedlings was performed and a transcription factor TaERF4a (GenBank NO. AFP49822.1) interacting with wheat dehydrin wzy1-2 gene (Gene ID: 100037544) promoter was identified by yeast one-hybrid assay. The regulator TaERF4a and the wzy1-2 gene can respond to the abiotic stress, the induced transcripts of these two genes exhibit a similar expression trend under adverse environmental conditions. In planta, the dual luciferase transient assay analysis showed that TaERF4a can positively regulate the expression of WZY1-2 dehydrin. Therefore, the obtained results suggest that ERF transcription factor can regulate the expression level of the dehydrin gene in wheat."

"24310937","abstracttext","A 1700 base pairHindIII restriction fragment from theE. gracilis chloroplast chromosome has been shown to contain the gene for the proton-translocating subunit of the ATP synthase (atpH). The gene was mapped by heterologous hybridization using internal sequences of the gene from wheat and spinach chloroplast DNA. Each chloroplast chromosome contains a single copy of atpH, which is located close to the gene for the alpha subunit of the ATP synthase (atpA). The nucleotide sequence of the gene is uninterrupted by introns. The predicted sequence of 77 amino acids is 70% homologous to that of the wheat and spinach polypeptides. The gene is expressedin vivo as shown by hybridization of atpH probes to cellulose nitrate filter blots of total chloroplast RNA. 5'-proximal to the atpH locus on the clonedHindIII fragment are 38 codons from the carboxy terminus of an open reading frame which may be another ATP synthase subunit. Transcription of the ORF and the atpH gene may be as part of a large polycistronic mRNA."

"21943048","abstracttext_background","Revolver is a newly discovered multi-gene family of transposable elements in the Triticeae genome. Revolver encompasses 2929 to 3041 bp, has 20 bp of terminal inverted repeated sequences at both ends, and contains a transcriptionally active gene encoding a DNA-binding-like protein. A putative TATA box is located at base 221, with a cap site at base 261 and a possible polyadenylation signal AATAAA at base 2918. Revolver shows considerable quantitative variation in wheat and its relatives."
"21943048","abstracttext_results","Revolver cDNAs varied between 395 and 2,182 bp in length. The first exon exhibited length variation, but the second and third exons were almost identical. These variants in the Revolver family shared the downstream region of the second intron, but varied structurally at the 5' first exon. There were 58 clones, which showed partial homology to Revolver, among 440,000 expressed sequence tagged (EST) clones sourced from Triticeae. In these Revolver homologues with lengths of 360-744 bp, the portion after the 2nd exon was conserved (65-79% homology), but the 1st exon sequences had mutually low homology, with mutations classified into 12 types, and did not have EST sequences with open reading frames (ORFs). By PCR with the 3'-flanking region of a typical genomic clone of Revolver-2 used as a single primer, rye chromosomes 1R and 5R could be simultaneously identified. Extensive eco-geographic diversity and divergence was observed among 161 genotypes of the single species Triticum dicoccoides collected from 18 populations in Israel with varying exposures to abiotic and biotic stresses (soil, temperature, altitude, water availability, and pathogens)."
"21943048","abstracttext_conclusions","On the base of existing differences between Revolver variants, the molecular markers that can distinguish different rye chromosomes were developed. Eco-geographic diversification of wild emmer T. dicoccoides in Israel and high Revolver copy numbers are associated with higher rainfall and biotic stresses. The remarkable quantitative differences among copy numbers of Revolver in the same species from different ecosystems suggest strong amplification activity within the last 10,000 years. It is the interesting finding because the majority of Triticeae high-copy transposable elements seem to be inactive at the recent time except for BARE-1 element in Hordeum and the fact might be interesting to perceive the processes of plant adaptive evolution."
"15085449","articletitle","Sequence analysis of the long arm of rice chromosome 11 for rice-wheat synteny."
"15085449","abstracttext","The DNA sequence of 106 BAC/PAC clones in the minimum tiling path (MTP) of the long arm of rice chromosome 11, between map positions 57.3 and 116.2 cM, has been assembled to phase 2 or PLN level. This region has been sequenced to 10x redundancy by the Indian Initiative for Rice Genome Sequencing (IIRGS) and is now publicly available in GenBank. The region, excluding overlaps, has been predicted to contain 2,932 genes using different software. A gene-by-gene BLASTN search of the NCBI wheat EST database of over 420,000 cDNA sequences revealed that 1,143 of the predicted rice genes (38.9%) have significant homology to wheat ESTs (bit score >/= 100). Further BLASTN search of these 1,143 rice genes with the GrainGenes database of sequence contigs containing bin-mapped wheat ESTs allowed 113 of the genes to be placed in bins located on wheat chromosomes of different homoeologous groups. The largest number of genes, about one-third, mapped to the homoeologous group 4 chromosomes of wheat, suggesting a common evolutionary origin. The remaining genes were located on wheat chromosomes of different groups with significantly higher numbers for groups 3 and 5. Location of bin-mapped wheat contigs to chromosomes of all the seven homoeologous groups can be ascribed to movement of genes (transpositions) or chromosome segments (translocations) within rice or the hexaploid wheat genomes. Alternatively, it could be due to ancient duplications in the common ancestral genome of wheat and rice followed by selective elimination of genes in the wheat and rice genomes. While there exists definite conservation of gene sequences and the ancestral chromosomal identity between rice and wheat, there is no obvious conservation of the gene order at this level of resolution. Lack of extensive colinearity between rice and wheat genomes suggests that there have been many insertions, deletions, duplications and translocations that make the synteny comparisons much more complicated than earlier thought. However, enhanced resolution of comparative sequence analysis may reveal smaller conserved regions of colinearity, which will facilitate selection of markers for saturation mapping and sequencing of the gene-rich regions of the wheat genome."

In this work, we isolated and sequenced the homolog of the D53 gene in several accessions of the wild grass Dasypyrum villosum of different geographical origins, resulting in the discovery of large allelic variety. A molecular marker was also created that allows us to differentiate the D. villosum D53 gene from common wheat genes. Using this marker and monosomic addition, substitution and translocation wheat lines carrying the known D. villosum chromosomes, the D53 gene was localized on the long arm of the 5V chromosome."

The GRRs varied both in gene number and density. The five largest GRRs physically spanning <3% of the genome contained 26% of the wheat genes. Approximate size of the GRRs ranged from 3 to 71 Mb. Recombination mainly occurred in the GRRs. Various GRRs varied as much as 128-fold for gene density and 140-fold for recombination rates. Except for a general suppression in 25-40% of the chromosomal region around centromeres, no correlation of recombination was observed with the gene density, the size, or chromosomal location of GRRs. More than 30% of the wheat genes are in recombination-poor regions thus are inaccessible to map-based cloning."

"16534972","abstracttext","Tn5-B20 (lacZ as reporter gene) transcriptional fusion mutants of Pseudomonas fluorescens R2f were screened for their response to wheat root exudate. Several mutants showed (beta)-galactosidase activity under the influence of wheat root exudate. In one such mutant, RIWE8, gene expression was specifically induced by proline but not by 125 other substrates. This mutant also showed reporter gene induction, albeit to a lesser extent, by exudate of maize and grass roots but not by that of clover roots. In situ promoter activity of RIWE8 was found in Flevo silt loam soil amended with proline but not in water-, arginine-, glutamic acid-, or malic acid-amended soils. Reporter gene expression in RIWE8 was triggered in a model rhizosphere-soil system in the presence of wheat, maize, and grass roots but not in the presence of clover roots or in root-free (bulk) soil. The induction of expression of the reporter gene in soil, using this approach, is suggestive that promoter activity in RIWE8 may be useful for the construction of organisms with rhizosphere-controlled beneficial genes."

"16944595","abstracttext","DNA samples of 19 wheat cultivars or lines were screened with the primer pair Xgwm410, a diagnostic marker of wheat stripe rust resistant gene YrCN19. The results showed that the wheat cultivars or lines CN19, XK5, AIM5 and AIM6 produced the amplicon Xgwm410/391, which co-segregated with the resistance of YrCN19, but other cultivars or lines did not produced it. Pedigree analysis and resistance test showed that CN19, XK5, AIM5 and AIM6 carried wheat stripe rust gene YrCN19. Genetic analysis proved that the resistance to wheat stripe rust of CN19, XK5, and AIM5 inherited in single dominant gene genetic law (3 resistant: 1 susceptible). The results also proved that the resistance descent in the cross combination Yanfu188/AIM6 complied with the single dominant gene genetic law (3 resistant: 1 susceptible), while the resistance inheritance in other cross combinations (CN18/AIM6, Lu955159/AIM6 and Shu3110/ AIM6) complied with two gene complementary genetic law (9 resistant: 7 susceptible). The results suggested that the resistance expression and separation of YrCN19 was distinct in the various genetic backgrounds or cross combinations. This study would expedite the exploitation and utilization of YrCN19 in wheat resistant breeding."
"17021941","articletitle","Wheat Dof transcription factor WPBF interacts with TaQM and activates transcription of an alpha-gliadin gene during wheat seed development."
"17021941","abstracttext","Wheat prolamin-box binding factor (WPBF), a DOF transcription factor previously was isolated from wheat endosperm and suggested to function as an activator of prolamin gene expression during seed development. In this study, we showed that WPBF is expressed in all wheat tissues analyzed, and a protein, TaQM, was identified from a wheat root cDNA library, to interact with the Dof domain of WPBF. The specific interaction between WPBF and TaQM was confirmed by pull-down assay and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiment. The expression patterns of TaQM gene are similar with that of WPBF. The GST-WPBF expressed in bacteria binds the Prolamin box (PB) 5'-TGTAAAG-3', derived from the promoter region of a native alpha-gliadin gene encoding a storage protein. Transient expression experiments in co-transfected BY-2 protoplast cells demonstrated that WPBF trans-activated transcription from native alpha-gliadin promoter through binding to the intact PB. When WPBF and TaQM are co-transfected together the transcription activity of alpha-gliadin gene was six-fold higher than when WPBF was transfected alone. Furthermore, the promoter activities of WPBF gene were observed in the seeds and the vascular system of transgenic Arabidopsis, which was identical to the expression profiles of WPBF in wheat. Hence, we proposed that WPBF functions not only during wheat seed development but also during other growth and development processes."

In phylogenetic analyses using maximum likelihood, parsimony and distance methods, the predicted protein sequence of wheat-G (1005 amino acids, 113 kDa) clusters with sequences of previously assigned mitochondrial RNAPs from dicotyledonous plants (Arabidopsis thaliana, Chenopodium album); likewise, in such analyses, the wheat-C sequence (949 amino acids, 107 kDa) affiliates specifically with the Arabidopsis sequence that encodes a phage-like RNAP thought to function in chloroplasts. To confirm biochemically the assignment of the gene encoding the putative wheat mitochondrial RNAP, we isolated a ca. 100 kDa wheat mitochondrial protein that is enriched in fractions displaying specific in vitro transcription activity and that reacts with an antibody raised against a recombinant maize phage-type RNAP. Internal peptide sequence information obtained from the 100-kDa polypeptide revealed that it corresponds to the predicted wheat-G cDNA sequence, providing direct evidence that the wheat-G gene (which we propose to call RpoTm) encodes the wheat mitochondrial RNAP."

We have isolated the gene that encodes a host-selective toxic protein produced by the fungus Pyrenophora tritici-repentis and confirmed that this gene functions in the plant as the primary determinant of pathogenicity in the Pyrenophora-wheat interaction. These results demonstrate that a single gene encodes the production of a host-selective toxin and that transformation of this gene into a non-toxin-producing isolate of P. tritici-repentis leads to both toxin production and pathogenicity."

The putative amino acid sequence of this gene consists of 173 amino acid residues, and is an acid polypeptide. It was highly homologous to thaumatin proteins isolated from other plants, so it is designated as TaTLP1 (GenBank accession number: AF384146). Northern blot analysis of TaTLP1 showed that the transcription difference obviously existed between resistant wheat-Haynaldia villosa 6VS/6AL translocation line and susceptible ""Yangmai 5"". The result of western blot showed that the protein expression product of TaTLP1 gene in wheat seedling leaf was a soluble cytoplasm protein, whose expression was induced by fungus Erysiph graminis and apparently related to disease resistance of the 6VS/6AL translocation line. Southern blot indicated that the TaTLP1 gene had 1-2 copies in wheat genome, and had been localized on the specific region of 7B and 7D chromosomes in wheat."

"15800731","abstracttext","Solid-state fermentation (SSF) with Aspergillus oryzae results in high levels of secreted protein. However, control mechanisms of gene expression in SSF have been only poorly studied. In this study we show that both glucoamylase (glaB) and protease (alpA, nptB) genes are highly expressed during surface cultivation on wheat-based solid medium, and even higher during cultivation on wheat kernels. In wheat-based liquid medium, low levels of gene expression are observed. Typical SSF cultivation conditions, such as low water activity and the formation of aerial hyphae, did not contribute to the high-level gene expression on wheat-based solid medium. Analysis of wheat-based solid and liquid cultivations showed differences in carbon and nitrogen utilisation and external pH. The results presented show that the difference in regulation of transcription of the alpA and nptB genes in wheat-based liquid and solid medium could be pH dependent, involving a pH-dependent transcription regulator. The results obtained suggest that the difference in regulation of transcription of the glaB gene in wheat-based liquid and solid medium is caused by a difference in carbohydrate degradation and consumption under the different culture conditions."

"22366867","abstracttext","Functional markers (FM) are developed from sequence polymorphisms present in allelic variants of a functional gene at a locus. FMs accurately discriminate alleles of a targeted gene, and are ideal molecular markers for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding. In this paper, we summarize FMs developed and used in common wheat. To date, more than 30 wheat loci associated with processing quality, agronomic traits, and disease resistance, have been cloned, and 97 FMs were developed to identify 93 alleles based on the sequences of those genes. A general approach is described for isolation of wheat genes and development of FMs based on in silico cloning and comparative genomics. The divergence of DNA sequences of different alleles that affect gene function is summarized. In addition, 14 molecular markers specific for alien genes introduced from common wheat relatives were also described. This paper provides updated information on all FMs and gene-specific STS markers developed so far in wheat and should facilitate their application in wheat breeding programs."

"24322586","abstracttext","The grass species Brachypodium distachyon has emerged as a model system for the study of gene structure and function in temperate cereals. As a first demonstration of the utility of Brachypodium to study wheat gene promoter function, we transformed it with a T-DNA that included the uidA reporter gene under control of a wheat High-Molecular-Weight Glutenin Subunit (HMW-GS) gene promoter and transcription terminator. For comparison, the same expression cassette was introduced into wheat by biolistics. Histochemical staining for β-glucuronidase (GUS) activity showed that the wheat promoter was highly expressed in the endosperms of all the seeds of Brachypodium and wheat homozygous plants. It was not active in any other tissue of transgenic wheat, but showed variable and sporadic activity in a minority of styles of the pistils of four homozygous transgenic Brachypodium lines. The ease of obtaining transgenic Brachypodium plants and the overall faithfulness of expression of the wheat HMW-GS promoter in those plants make it likely that this model system can be used for studies of other promoters from cereal crop species that are difficult to transform."

"32120271","abstracttext","Hybrid necrosis and hybrid chlorosis are sometimes observed in interspecific hybrids between the tetraploid wheat cultivar Langdon and diploid wild wheat Aegilops tauschii. Many WRKY transcription factor genes are dramatically upregulated in necrosis and chlorosis wheat hybrids. Here, we isolated cDNA clones for four wheat WRKY transcription factor genes, TaWRKY49, TaWRKY92, TaWRKY112, and TaWRKY142, that were commonly upregulated in the hybrid necrosis and hybrid chlorosis and belonged to the same clade of the WRKY gene family. Expression patterns of the four TaWRKY genes in response to several stress conditions were similar in wheat seeding leaves. The four TaWRKY-GFP fusion proteins were targeted to the nucleus in onion epidermal cells. The TaWRKY gene expression levels were increased by high salt, dehydration, darkness, and blast fungus treatment in common wheat. Expression of either of the TaWRKY genes increased salinity and osmotic stress tolerance accompanied with overexpression of STZ/Zat10, and induced overexpression of the salicylic acid-signal pathway marker gene AtPR1 in transgenic Arabidopsis. TaWRKY142 expression also induced the jasmonic acid-pathway marker gene AtPDF1.2 and enhanced resistance against the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum higginsianum in transgenic Arabidopsis. These results suggest that the four TaWRKY genes act as integrated hubs of multiple stress signaling pathways in wheat and play important roles in autoimmune response-inducing hybrid necrosis and hybrid chlorosis."

"30407665","abstracttext","Improving traits in wheat has historically been challenging due to its large and polyploid genome, limited genetic diversity and in-field phenotyping constraints. However, within recent years many of these barriers have been lowered. The availability of a chromosome-level assembly of the wheat genome now facilitates a step-change in wheat genetics and provides a common platform for resources, including variation data, gene expression data and genetic markers. The development of sequenced mutant populations and gene-editing techniques now enables the rapid assessment of gene function in wheat directly. The ability to alter gene function in a targeted manner will unmask the effects of homoeolog redundancy and allow the hidden potential of this polyploid genome to be discovered. New techniques to identify and exploit the genetic diversity within wheat wild relatives now enable wheat breeders to take advantage of these additional sources of variation to address challenges facing food production. Finally, advances in phenomics have unlocked rapid screening of populations for many traits of interest both in greenhouses and in the field. Looking forwards, integrating diverse data types, including genomic, epigenetic and phenomics data, will take advantage of big data approaches including machine learning to understand trait biology in wheat in unprecedented detail."

The former includes both winter and spring forms with a predominance of winter forms, whereas T. timopheevii is considered a spring species. In order to clarify the origin of the spring growth habit in T. timopheevii, allelic variability of the VRN-1 gene was investigated in a set of accessions of both tetraploid species, together with the diploid species Ae. speltoides, presumed donor of the G genome to these tetraploids."
"28105942","abstracttext_results","The promoter region of the VRN-A1 locus in all studied tetraploid accessions of both T. araraticum and T. timopheevii represents the previously described allele VRN-A1f with a 50 bp deletion near the start codon. Three additional alleles were identified namely, VRN-A1f-del, VRN-A1f-ins and VRN-A1f-del/ins, which contained large mutations in the first (1 st ) intron of VRN-A1. The first allele, carrying a deletion of 2.7 kb in a central part of intron 1, occurred in a few accessions of T. araraticum and no accessions of T. timopheevii. The VRN-A1f-ins allele, containing the insertion of a 0.4 kb MITE element about 0.4 kb upstream from the start of intron 1, and allele VRN-A1f-del/ins having this insertion coupled with a deletion of 2.7 kb are characteristic only for T. timopheevii. Allelic variation at the VRN-G1 locus includes the previously described allele VRN-G1a (with the insertion of a 0.2 kb MITE in the promoter) found in a few accessions of both tetraploid species. We showed that alleles VRN-A1f-del and VRN-G1a have no association with the spring growth habit, while in all accessions of T. timopheevii this habit was associated with the dominant VRN-A1f-ins and VRN-A1f-del/ins alleles. None of the Ae. speltoides accessions included in this study had changes in the promoter or 1 st intron regions of VRN-1 which might confer a spring growth habit. The VRN-1 promoter sequences analyzed herein and downloaded from databases have been used to construct a phylogram to assess the time of divergence of Ae. speltoides in relation to other wheat species."
"28105942","abstracttext_conclusions","Among accessions of T. araraticum, the preferentially winter predecessor of T. timopheevii, two large mutations were found in both VRN-A1 and VRN-G1 loci (VRN-A1f-del and VRN-G1a) that were found to have no effect on vernalization requirements. Spring tetraploid T. timopheevii had one VRN-1 allele in common for two species (VRN-G1a), and two that were specific (VRN-A1f-ins, VRN-A1f-del/ins). The latter alleles include mutations in the 1 st intron of VRN-A1 and also share a 0.4 kb MITE insertion near the start of intron 1. We suggested that this insertion resulted in a spring growth habit in a progenitor of T. timopheevii which has probably been selected during subsequent domestication. The phylogram constructed on the basis of the VRN-1 promoter sequences confirmed the early divergence (~3.5 MYA) of the ancestor(s) of the B/G genomes from Ae. speltoides."

"18980638","abstracttext","The Pm3 alleles of cultivated bread wheat confer gene for gene resistance to the powdery mildew fungus. They represent a particular case of plant disease resistance gene evolution, because of their recent origin and possible evolution after the formation of hexaploid wheat. The Pm3 locus is conserved in tetraploid wheat, thereby allowing the comparative evolutionary study of the same resistance locus in a domesticated species and in one of its wild ancestors. We have identified 61 Pm3 allelic sequences from wild and domesticated tetraploid wheat subspecies. The Pm3 sequences corresponded to 24 different haplotypes. They showed low sequence diversity, differing by only a few polymorphic sequence blocks that were further reshuffled between alleles by gene conversion and recombination. Polymorphic sequence blocks are different from the blocks found in functional Pm3 alleles of hexaploid wheat, indicating an independent evolution of the Pm3 loci in the two species. A new functional gene was identified in a wild wheat accession from Syria. This gene, Pm3k, conferred intermediate race-specific resistance to powdery mildew, and consists of a mosaic of gene segments derived from non-functional alleles. This demonstrates that Pm3-based resistance is not very frequent in wild tetraploid wheat, and that the evolution of functional resistance genes occurred independently in wild tetraploid and bread wheat. The Pm3 sequence variability and geographic distribution indicated that diversity was higher in wild emmer wheat from the Levant area, compared with the accessions from Turkey. Further screens for Pm3 functional genes in wild wheat should therefore focus on accessions from the Levant region."

"19727825","abstracttext","Studies into gene expression in a foreign background contribute toward understanding of how genes derived from different species or genera manages to co-exist in a common nucleus, on the one hand, and help to estimate possible effectiveness of wide hybridization for cultivated plant improvement, on the other hand. The aim of this study was to investigate conservation of wheat and rye expression networks, using the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway (ABP) genes as a model system. We isolated and analyzed ABP genes encoding enzymes acting at different steps of the pathway: chalcone-flavanone isomerase (CHI), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), anthocyanidin synthase (ANS), and anthocyanidin-3-glucoside rhamnosyltransferase (3RT). The rye ABP genes locations we determined (Chi on chromosome 5RL, F3h on 2RL, Ans on 6RL, 3Rt on 5RL, the regulatory Rc--red coleoptile--gene on 4RL) were in agreement with the rearrangements established between rye and wheat chromosomes. Expression of the ABP structural genes was studied in wheat-rye chromosome addition and substitution lines. F3h activation by the Rc gene was found to be critical for the red coleoptile trait formation. It was shown that the rye regulatory Rc gene can activate the wheat target gene F3h and vice versa wheat Rc induces expression of rye F3h. However, lower level of expression of rye F3h in comparison with that of the two wheat orthologues in the wheat-rye chromosome substitution line 2R(2D) was observed. Thus, although work of the wheat and rye ABP gene systems following the formation of wheat-rye hybrids is finely coordinated, some divergence exists between rye and wheat ABP genes, affecting level of gene expression."

"26975052","abstracttext","Pollen-mediated gene flow (PMGF) is the main mode of transgene flow in flowering plants. The study of pollen and gene flow of transgenic wheat can help to establish the corresponding strategy for preventing transgene escape and contamination between compatible genotypes in wheat. To investigate the pollen dispersal and gene flow frequency in various directions and distances around the pollen source and detect the association between frequency of transgene flow and pollen density from transgenic wheat, a concentric circle design was adopted to conduct a field experiment using transgenic wheat with resistance to wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV) as the pollen donor and dwarf male-sterile wheat as the pollen receptor. The results showed that the pollen and gene flow of transgenic wheat varied significantly among the different compass sectors. A higher pollen density and gene flow frequency was observed in the downwind SW and W sectors, with average frequencies of transgene flow of 26.37 and 23.69% respectively. The pollen and gene flow of transgenic wheat declined dramatically with increasing distance from its source. Most of the pollen grains concentrated within 5 m and only a few pollen grains were detected beyond 30 m. The percentage of transgene flow was the highest where adjacent to the pollen source, with an average of 48.24% for all eight compass directions at 0 m distance. Transgene flow was reduced to 50% and 95% between 1.61 to 3.15 m, and 10.71 to 20.93 m, respectively. Our results suggest that climate conditions, especially wind direction, may significantly affect pollen dispersal and gene flow of wheat. The isolation-by-distance model is one of the most effective methods for achieving stringent transgene confinement in wheat. The frequency of transgene flow is directly correlated with the relative density of GM pollen grains in air currents, and pollen competition may be a major factor influencing transgene flow."
"26011437","articletitle","A novel highly differentially expressed gene in wheat endosperm associated with bread quality."
"26011437","abstracttext","Analysis of gene expression in developing wheat seeds was used to identify a gene, wheat bread making (wbm), with highly differential expression (~1000 fold) in the starchy endosperm of genotypes varying in bread making quality. Several alleles differing in the 5'-upstream region (promoter) of this gene were identified, with one present only in genotypes with high levels of wbm expression. RNA-Seq analysis revealed low or no wbm expression in most genotypes but high expression (0.2-0.4% of total gene expression) in genotypes that had good bread loaf volume. The wbm gene is predicted to encode a mature protein of 48 amino acids (including four cysteine residues) not previously identified in association with wheat quality, possibly because of its small size and low frequency in the wheat gene pool. Genotypes with high wbm expression all had good bread making quality but not always good physical dough qualities. The predicted protein was sulphur rich suggesting the possibility of a contribution to bread loaf volume by supporting the crossing linking of proteins in gluten. Improved understanding of the molecular basis of differences in bread making quality may allow more rapid development of high performing genotypes with acceptable end-use properties and facilitate increased wheat production."

"32562491","abstracttext_results","Using a precisely defined framework of highly conserved syntenic genes on hexaploid wheat chromosome 3DL and its progenitor 3 L chromosome arm of diploid Aegilops tauschii, we show that 70% of these gene pairs exhibited proportionately reduced gene expression, in which expression in the hexaploid context of the 3DL genes was ∼40% of the levels observed in diploid Ae tauschii. Several genes showed elevated expression during the later stages of grain development in wheat compared with Ae tauschii. Gene sequence and methylation differences probably accounted for only a few cases of differences in gene expression. In contrast, chromosome-wide patterns of reduced chromatin accessibility of genes in the hexaploid chromosome arm compared with its diploid progenitor were correlated with both reduced gene expression and the imposition of new patterns of gene expression."

"10659768","abstracttext","The entire nucleotide sequence of a 21.1-kb fragment of wheat chloroplast (ct) DNA was determined. This fragment carries 18 intact genes and parts of two additional genes, including the three RNA polymerase genes rpoB, rpoC1, and rpoC2. The gene arrangement of this region is conserved in wheat, rice, and maize, but not in non-grass species. Comparison of these 20 genes in wheat, rice, and maize showed that tRNA genes evolved more slowly than protein-coding genes in the chloroplast genome. Intergenic regions evolved much faster than both types of genes. Although the 19 genes of wheat, except for orf42, showed high identity to those of other plants, there were three novel structural features in the wheat rpoC2 gene; a deletion of 81 bp in the middle region, a variable insertion (408 bp), and a nonsense mutation in the 3' terminal region, resulting in truncation of a sequence of ca. 10 amino acids. An intermolecular recombination between the stretches of CTTAT and CTTTT was suggested as the mechanism of the 81-bp deletion in the wheat rpoC2 gene. Evolutionary distance between the chloroplast genomes of wheat and maize was larger than those between wheat and rice and between rice and maize."

"19810806","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused primarily by Fusarium graminearum, decreases grain yield and quality in wheat and barley. Disease severity, deoxynivalenol (DON), fungal biomass, and transcript accumulation were examined in a wheat near-isogenic line pair carrying either the resistant or susceptible allele for the chromosome 3BS FHB-resistance quantitative trait locus (Fhb1). Fhb1 restricts spread of disease symptoms but does not provide resistance to initial infection or initial DON accumulation. Wheat exhibits both induction and repression of large sets of gene transcripts during F. graminearum infection. In addition, a difference in the general timing of transcript accumulation in plants carrying either the resistant or susceptible allele at the Fhb1 locus was detected, and 14 wheat gene transcripts were detected that exhibited accumulation differences between the resistant and susceptible alleles. These results indicate that these may be host responses that differentiate the resistant from the susceptible interaction. Comparative analysis of the wheat-F. graminearum and the barley-F. graminearum interactions revealed a large set of conserved transcript accumulation patterns. However, we also detected gene transcripts that were repressed in wheat but not in barley. Based on the disease symptoms, transcript accumulation data, and comparative analysis of the barley and wheat host response to F. graminearum infection, we developed an integrated model for the interactions of wheat and barley with F. graminearum."

In this study we identify wheat genes that are differentially expressed in response to the R. solani isolate, AG8, using microarray technology. A significant number of wheat genes identified in this screen were involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and redox regulation. Levels of ROS species were increased in wheat root tissue following R. solani infection as determined by Nitro Blue Tetrazolium (NBT), 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and titanium sulphate measurements. Pathogen/ROS related genes from R. solani were also tested for expression patterns upon wheat infection. TmpL, a R. solani gene homologous to a gene associated with ROS regulation in Alternaria brassicicola, and OAH, a R. solani gene homologous to oxaloacetate acetylhydrolase which has been shown to produce oxalic acid in Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, were highly induced in R. solani when infecting wheat. We speculate that the interplay between the wheat and R. solani ROS generating proteins may be important for determining the outcome of the wheat/R. solani interaction."

"30128352","abstracttext","Wheat is an important staple grain for humankind globally because of its end-use quality and nutritional properties and its adaptability to diverse climates. For a small proportion of the population, specific wheat proteins can trigger adverse immune responses and clinical manifestations such as celiac disease, wheat allergy, baker's asthma, and wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA). Establishing the content and distribution of the immunostimulatory regions in wheat has been hampered by the complexity of the wheat genome and the lack of complete genome sequence information. We provide novel insights into the wheat grain proteins based on a comprehensive analysis and annotation of the wheat prolamin Pfam clan grain proteins and other non-prolamin allergens implicated in these disorders using the new International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium bread wheat reference genome sequence, RefSeq v1.0. Celiac disease and WDEIA genes are primarily expressed in the starchy endosperm and show wide variation in protein- and transcript-level expression in response to temperature stress. Nonspecific lipid transfer proteins and α-amylase trypsin inhibitor gene families, implicated in baker's asthma, are primarily expressed in the aleurone layer and transfer cells of grains and are more sensitive to cold temperature. The study establishes a new reference map for immunostimulatory wheat proteins and provides a fresh basis for selecting wheat lines and developing diagnostics for products with more favorable consumer attributes."

"29476226","abstracttext_key message","Yr10 is an important gene to control wheat stripe rust, and the search for Yr10 needs to be continued. Wheat stripe rust or yellow rust is a devastating fungal disease caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). Host disease resistance offers a primary source for controlling wheat stripe rust. The stripe rust resistance gene Yr10 confers the race-specific resistance to most tested Pst races in China including CYR29. Early studies proposed that Yr10 was a nucleotide-binding site, leucine-rich repeat gene archived as GenBank accession AF149112 (hereafter designated the Yr10 candidate gene or Yr10 CG ). In this study, we revealed that 15 Chinese wheat cultivars positive for Yr10 CG are susceptible to CYR29. We then expressed the Yr10 CG cDNA in the common wheat 'Bobwhite'. The Yr10 CG -cDNA positive transgenic plants were also susceptible to CYR29. Thus, it is highly unlikely that Yr10 CG corresponds to the Yr10 resistance gene. Using the Yr10 donor 'Moro' and the Pst-susceptible wheat 'Huixianhong', we generated two F 3 populations that displayed a single Mendelian segregation on the Yr10 gene, and used them to remap the Yr10 gene. Six markers were placed in the Yr10 region, with the Yr10 CG gene now mapping about 1.2-cM proximal to the Yr10 locus and the Xsdauw79 marker is completely linked to the Yr10 locus. Apparently, the Yr10 gene has not yet been identified. Fine mapping and positional cloning of Yr10 is important for gene pyramiding for stripe rust resistance in wheat."

"2103481","abstracttext","We previously reported that the expression of the wheat Cab-1 gene is regulated by an endogenous circadian rhythm and by the photoreceptor phytochrome both in wheat and in transgenic tobacco plants. To define regulatory elements necessary for the circadian rhythm-regulated Cab-1 gene expression, we now analysed the fluctuation of steady-state mRNA levels in a series of 5' deletion mutants in transgenic tobacco plants. We found that the expression of a deletion mutant containing 211 bp upstream sequence still exhibited circadian rhythm. Furthermore we show that an enhancer-like sequence of the Cab-1 promoter (from -357 to -90) can endow a chimaeric gene consisting of a truncated 35S promoter (from -90 to +8) and the bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene with circadian clock-regulated gene expression. Finally we demonstrate by nuclear run-off experiments that the transcription rates of the Cab genes in wheat oscillate in a rhythmic manner, with a periodicity of approximately 24 hours. Consistent with our previous findings these results (i) indicate that the expression of the wheat Cab-1 gene is regulated mainly at the transcription level and (ii) identify a short promoter region between -211 and -90 that is responsible for the circadian clock-regulated gene expression."

"23706072","abstracttext","Seed storage and disease resistance proteins are major traits of wheat. The study of their gene organization and evolution has some implications in breeding. In this study, we characterized the hexaploid wheat D-genome BAC clone TaBAC703A9 that contains a low molecular weight glutenin locus (Glu-D3) and a resistance gene analogue cluster. With a gene density of one gene per 4.8 kb, the cluster contains four resistance gene analogues, namely Tak703-1, Lrr703, Tak703, and Lrk703. This structural cluster unit was conserved across nine grass genomes, but divergent evolutionary mechanisms have been involved in shaping the Tak/Lrk loci in the different species. Gene duplication was the major force for the Tak/Lrk evolution in oats, maize, barley, wheat, sorghum, and Brachypodium, while tandem duplication drove the expansion of this locus in japonica rice. Despite the close proximity of the Glu-D3 and the Tak/Lrk loci in wheat, the evolutionary mechanisms that drove their amplification differ. The Glu-D3 region had a lower gene density, and its amplification was driven by retroelements."

"17103227","abstracttext","Lophopyrum elongatum is a wild relative of wheat that provides a source of novel genes for improvement of the salt tolerance of bread wheat. Improved Na(+) 'exclusion' is associated with salt tolerance in a wheat-L. elongatum amphiploid, in which a large proportion (ca. 50%) of the improved regulation of leaf Na(+) concentrations is controlled by chromosome 3E. In this study, genes that might control Na(+) accumulation, such as for transporters responsible for Na(+) entry (HKT1) and exit (SOS1) from cells, or compartmentalisation within vacuoles (NHX1, NHX5, AVP1, AVP2) in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, were targeted for comparative analyses in wheat. Putative rice orthologues were identified and characterised as a means to bridge the large evolutionary distance between genomes from the model dicot and the more complex grass species. Wheat orthologues were identified through BLAST searching to identify either FL-cDNAs or ESTs and were subsequently used to design primers to amplify genomic DNA. The probable orthologous status of the wheat genes was confirmed through demonstration of similar intron-exon structure with their counterparts in Arabidopsis and rice. The majority of exons for Arabidopsis, rice and wheat orthologues of NHX1, NHX5 and SOS1 were conserved except for those at the amino and carboxy terminal ends. However, additional exons were identified in the predicted NHX1 and SOS1 genes of rice and wheat, as compared with Arabidopsis, indicating gene rearrangement events during evolution from a common ancestor. Nullisomic-tetrasomic, deletion and addition lines in wheat were used to assign gene sequences to chromosome regions in wheat and L. elongatum. Most sequences were assigned to homoeologous chromosomes, however, in some instances, such as for SOS1, genes were mapped to other unpredicted locations. Differential transcript abundance under salt stress indicated a complex pattern of expression for wheat orthologues that may regulate Na(+) accumulation in wheat lines containing chromosomes from L. elongatum. The identification of wheat orthologues to well characterized Arabidopsis genes, map locations and gene expression profiles increases our knowledge on the complex mechanisms regulating Na(+) transport in wheat and wheat-L. elongatum lines under salt stress."

Patterns of expression of the AP2-like genes were examined in floral organs and other tissues in barley, wheat and in tritordeum amphiploids (barley x wheat hybrids). In tritordeum amphiploids, the level of transcription of the barley AP2-like gene was lower than in its barley parental and the chromosome substitutions 1D/1Hch and 2D/2Hch were seen to modify AP2 gene expression levels."

"12199504","abstracttext","Through gene-for-gene interactions, wheat plants respond to specific biotypes of Hessian fly upon the initiation of first-instar larval feeding. Leaves of plants containing the H9 resistance gene responded to avirulent biotype L. larvae with rapid changes in the levels of several mRNA transcripts and initiation of an incompatible interaction. A low-copy gene, Hfr-1 (Hessian fly-response gene 1), responded with increased mRNA levels for two days before returning to preinfestation levels by day five. Hfr-1 mRNA was constitutively expressed in uninfested control plants as well as in plants infested with virulent larvae. The cDNA sequence was similar to a maize gene encoding a beta-glucosidase aggregating factor (BGAF), to jacalin-like mannose-binding lectins, and to several plant genes that respond to microbial infections. The potential roles of Hfr-1 in defending wheat against Hessian fly damage are discussed."

"21113791","abstracttext","Physical maps of chromosomes provide a framework for organizing and integrating diverse genetic information. DNA microarrays are a valuable technique for physical mapping and can also be used to facilitate the discovery of single feature polymorphisms (SFPs). Wheat chromosome arm 2BL was physically mapped using a Wheat Genome Array onto near-isogenic lines (NILs) with the aid of wheat-rice synteny and mapped wheat EST information. Using high variance probe set (HVP) analysis, 314 HVPs constituting genes present on 2BL were identified. The 314 HVPs were grouped into 3 categories: HVPs that match only rice chromosome 4 (298 HVPs), those that match only wheat ESTs mapped on 2BL (1), and those that match both rice chromosome 4 and wheat ESTs mapped on 2BL (15). All HVPs were converted into gene sets, which represented either unique rice gene models or mapped wheat ESTs that matched identified HVPs. Comparative physical maps were constructed for 16 wheat gene sets and 271 rice gene sets. Of the 271 rice gene sets, 257 were mapped to the 18-35 Mb regions on rice chromosome 4. Based on HVP analysis and sequence similarity between the gene models in the rice chromosomes and mapped wheat ESTs, the outermost rice gene model that limits the translocation breakpoint to orthologous regions was identified."

The copy number of PhyA was estimated to be one locus per haploid genome, and this gene was assigned to chromosomes 4AL, 4BS and 4DS. The Ppc gene showed a low copy number of small multigenes, and was located on the short arm of homoeologous group 3 chromosomes and the long arm of chromosomes of homoeologous group 7. RbcS consisted of a multigene family, with approximately 100 copies in the common wheat genome, and was located on the short arm of group 2 chromosomes and the long arm of group 5 chromosomes. Lhcb1 (*)1 also consisted of a multigene family with about 50 copies in common wheat. Only a limited number of restriction fragments (approximately 15%) were used to determine the locations of members of this family on the long arm of group 1 chromosomes owing to the multiplicity of DNA bands. The variability of hybridized bands with the four genes was less in polyploids, but was more in the case of multigene families. RFLP analysis of polyploid wheats and their presumed ancestors was carried out with probes of the oat PhyA gene, the maize Ppc gene, the wheat RbcS gene and the wheat Lhcb1 (*)1 gene. The RFLP patterns of common wheat most closely resembled those of T. Dicoccum (Emmer wheat), T. urartu (A genome), Ae. speltoides (S genome) and Ae. squarrosa (D genome). Diversification of genes in the wheat complex appear to have occurred mainly at the diploid level. Based on RFLP patterns, B and S genomes were clustered into two major groups. The fragment numbers per genome were reduced in proportion to the increase of ploidy level for all four genes, suggesting that some mechanism(s) might operate to restrict, and so keep to a minimum, the gene numbers in the polyploid genomes. However, the RbcS genes, located on 2BS, were more conserved (double dosage), indicating that the above mechanism(s) does not operate equally on individual genes."

"18953072","abstracttext","Wheat sharp eyespot, primarily caused by a soil-borne fungus Rhizoctonia cerealis, has become one of the most serious diseases of wheat in China. In this study, an ethylene response factor (ERF) gene from a wheat relative Thinopyrum intermedium, TiERF1, was characterized further, transgenic wheat lines expressing TiERF1 were developed, and the resistance of the transgenic wheat lines against R. cerealis was investigated. Southern blotting analysis indicated that at least two copies of the TiERF1 gene exist in the T. intermedium genome. Yeast one-hybrid assay indicated that the activation domain of TiERF1 is essential for activating the transcript of the reporter gene with the GCC-box cis-element. The TiERF1 gene was introduced into a Chinese wheat cultivar, Yangmai12, by biolistic bombardment. Results of PCR and Southern blotting analyses indicated that TiERF1 was successfully integrated into the genome of the transgenic wheat, where it can be passed down from the T0 to T4 generations. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis demonstrated that TiERF1 could be overexpressed in the stable transgenic plants, in which the expression levels of wheat pathogenesis-related (PR) genes primarily in the ethylene-dependent signal pathway, such as a chitinase gene and a beta-1,3-glucanase gene, were increased dramatically. Disease tests indicated that the overexpression of TiERF1 conferred enhanced resistance to sharp eyespot in the transgenic wheat lines compared with the wild-type and silenced TiERF1 plants. These results suggested that the overexpression of TiERF1 enhances resistance to sharp eyespot in transgenic wheat lines by activating PR genes primarily in the ethylene-dependent pathway."

"16315094","abstracttext","Global, comparative gene expression analysis is potentially a very powerful tool in the safety assessment of transgenic plants since it allows for the detection of differences in gene expression patterns between a transgenic line and the mother variety. In the present study, we compared the gene expression profile in developing seeds of wild type wheat and wheat transformed for endosperm-specific expression of an Aspergillus fumigatus phytase. High-level expression of the phytase gene was ensured by codon modification towards the prevalent codon usage of wheat genes and by using the wheat 1DX5HMW glutenin promoter for driving transgene expression. A 9K wheat unigene cDNA microarray was produced from cDNA libraries prepared mainly from developing wheat seed. The arrays were hybridised to flourescently labelled cDNA prepared from developing seeds of the transgenic wheat line and the mother variety, Bobwhite, at three developmental stages. Comparisons and statistical analyses of the gene expression profiles of the transgenic line vs. that of the mother line revealed only slight differences at the three developmental stages. In the few cases where differential expression was indicated by the statistical analysis it was primarily genes that were strongly expressed over a shorter interval of seed development such as genes encoding storage proteins. Accordingly, we interpret these differences in gene expression levels to result from minor asynchrony in seed development between the transgenic line and the mother line. In support of this, real time PCR validation of results from selected genes at the late developmental stage could not confirm differential expression of these genes. We conclude that the expression of the codon-modified A. fumigatus phytase gene in the wheat seed had no significant effects on the overall gene expression patterns in the developing seed."

Molecular analysis indicated that photobleached spikes or grains resulted from the reduction of endogenous PDS transcript abundances, suggesting that BSMV:PDS was able to induce PDS silencing in wheat spikes and grains. Inoculation onto wheat spikes from heading to flowering stage was optimal for efficient silencing of PDS in wheat spikes. Furthermore, we used the BSMV-based system to reduce the transcript level of 1Bx14, a gene encoding for High-molecular-weight glutenin subunit 1Bx14 (HMW-GS 1Bx14), by 97 % in the grains of the BSMV:1Bx14 infected spikes at 15 dpi, compared with that in BSMV:00 infected spikes, and the reduction persisted until at least 25 dpi. The amount of the HMW-GS 1Bx14 was also detectably decreased. The percentage of glutenin macropolymeric proteins in total proteins was significantly reduced in the grains of 1Bx14-silenced plants as compared with that in the grains of BSMV:00 infected control plants, indicating that HMW-GS 1Bx14 is one of major components participating in the formation of glutenin macropolymers in wheat grains."

The established BSMV-VIGS system will be very useful in future research on functional analysis of genes contributing to grain quality and the metabolic networks in developing seeds of wheat."

"15953539","abstracttext","Both wheat and barley belong to tribe Triticeae and are closely related. High-density detailed comparison of physical and genetic linkage maps revealed that wheat genes are present in physically small gene-rich regions (GRRs). One of the largest GRRs is located around fraction length 1.0 of the long arm of wheat homoeologous group 2 chromosomes termed the ""2L1.0 region."" The main objective of this study was to analyze the structural and functional organization of the 2L1.0 region in barley in comparison to wheat. Using the 29 physically mapped RFLP markers for the region, wheat and barley consensus genetic linkage maps of the 2L1.0 region were generated by combining information from 18 wheat and 7 barley genetic linkage maps. Comparative analysis using these consensus maps and other available wheat and barley mapping resources identified 227 DNA markers and ESTs for the region. The region accounted for 58% of the genes and 68% of the arm's recombination in wheat. However, the corresponding region in barley accounted for about 42% of the genes and 81% of the recombination. The kb/cM ratio for the region was 122 in barley compared to 244 in wheat. Distribution of genes and recombination varied between the two species even though the gene order and density were similar."

"30994893","abstracttext","Spike brittleness represents an important domestication trait in crops. Although the brittle rachis of wild wheat was cloned, however, the molecular mechanism underlying spike brittleness is yet to be elucidated. Here, we identified a single dominant brittle rachis gene Br-Ab on chromosome arm 3AbS using an F2 population of diploid wheat and designated Btr1-Ab. Sequence analysis of the Btr1-A gene in 40 diploid wheat accessions, 80 tetraploid wheat accessions and 38 hexaploid wheat accessions showed that two independent mutations (Ala119Thr for diploid and Gly97* for polyploids) in the Btr1-A coding region resulting in the nonbrittle rachis allele. Overexpression of Btr1-Ab in nonbrittle hexaploid wheat led to brittle rachis in transgenic plants. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that Btr1-A represses the expression of cell wall biosynthesis genes during wheat rachis development. In addition, we found that Btr1-A can modify spike morphology and reduce threshability, grain size and thousand grain weight in transgenic wheat. These results demonstrated that Btr1-A reduces cell wall synthesis in rachis nodes, resulting in natural spikelet shattering, and that the transition from Btr1-A to btr1-A during wheat domestication had profound effects on evolution of spike morphology and yield-related traits."

"32683473","abstracttext_key message","A stripe rust resistance QTL in durum wheat maps near the bread wheat Yr80 locus with the latter reduced to 15 candidate genes. Some wheat adult plant resistance (APR) genes provide partial resistance in the later stages of plant development to rust diseases and are an important component in protecting wheat crops from these fungal pathogens. These genes provide protection in both bread wheat and durum wheat. Here, we have mapped APR to wheat stripe rust, caused by the fungal pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, in a cross between durum cultivars Stewart and Bansi. Two resistance QTLs derived from the Stewart parent were identified in multi-generational field trials. One QTL is located on chromosome 1BL and maps to the previously identified Yr29/Lr46/Sr58/Pm39 multi-pathogen APR locus. The second locus, located on chromosome 3BL, maps near the recently described bread wheat APR gene, Yr80. Fine mapping in durum and bread wheat families shows that the durum 3BL locus and Yr80 are closely located, with the later APR gene reduced to 15 candidate genes present in the Chinese Spring genome sequence. Distorted segregation of the durum 3BL region was observed with the Stewart locus preferentially transmitted through pollen when compared with the equivalent Bansi region."

"25543966","abstracttext","Barley yellow mosaic virus (BaYMV) and Wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV) are separate species in the genus Bymovirus with bipartite plus-sense RNA genomes. In fields, BaYMV infects only barley and WYMV infects only wheat. Here, we studied the replicative capability of the two viruses in barley and wheat mesophyll protoplasts. BaYMV replicated in both barley and wheat protoplasts, but WYMV replicated only in wheat protoplasts. The expression of wheat translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), a common host factor for potyviruses, from the WYMV genome enabled WYMV replication in barley protoplasts. Replacing the BaYMV VPg gene with that of WYMV abolished BaYMV replication in barley protoplasts, whereas the additional expression of wheat eIF4E from BaYMV genome restored the replication of the BaYMV mutant in barley protoplasts. These results indicate that both VPg and the host eIF4E are involved in the host tropism of BaYMV and WYMV at the replication level."

"29109252","abstracttext","Male sterility is an essential trait in hybrid seed production for monoclinous crops, including rice and wheat. However, compared with the high percentage of hybrid rice planted in the world, little commercial hybrid wheat is planted globally as a result of the lack of a suitable system for male sterility. Therefore, understanding the molecular nature of male fertility in wheat is critical for commercially viable hybrid wheat. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of Male Sterility 1 ( Ms1 ) in bread wheat by using a combination of advanced genomic approaches. MS1 is a newly evolved gene in the Poaceae that is specifically expressed in microsporocytes, and is essential for microgametogenesis. Orthologs of Ms1 are expressed in diploid and allotetraploid ancestral species. Orthologs of Ms1 are epigenetically silenced in the A and D subgenomes of allohexaploid wheat; only Ms1 from the B subgenome is expressed. The encoded protein, Ms1, is localized to plastid and mitochondrial membranes, where it exhibits phospholipid-binding activity. These findings provide a foundation for the development of commercially viable hybrid wheat."

Development of supernumerary spikelets (SSs) at rachis nodes or on the extended rachillas is abnormal. Various wheat morphotypes with altered spike morphology, associated with the development of SSs, present an important genetic resource for studies on genetic regulation of wheat inflorescence development."
"29297328","abstracttext_results","Here we characterized diploid and tetraploid wheat lines of various non-standard spike morphotypes, which allowed for identification of a new mutant allele of the WHEAT FRIZZY PANICLE (WFZP) gene that determines spike branching in diploid wheat Ttiticum monococcum L. Moreover, we found that the development of SSs and spike branching in wheat T. durum Desf. was a result of a wfzp-A/TtBH-A1 mutation that originated from spontaneous hybridization with T. turgidum convar. сompositum (L.f.) Filat. Detailed characterization of the false-true ramification phenotype controlled by the recessive sham ramification 2 (shr2) gene in tetraploid wheat T. turgidum L. allowed us to suggest putative functions of the SHR2 gene that may be involved in the regulation of spikelet meristem fate and in specification of floret meristems. The results of a gene interaction test suggested that genes WFZP and SHR2 function independently in different processes during spikelet development, whereas another spike ramification gene(s) interact(s) with SHR2 and share(s) common functions."

"30244408","abstracttext_key message","We have isolated a novel powdery mildew resistance gene in wheat that was originally introgressed from rye. Further analysis revealed evolutionary divergent history of wheat and rye orthologous resistance genes. Wheat production is under constant threat from a number of fungal pathogens, among them is wheat powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici). Deployment of resistance genes is the most economical and sustainable method for mildew control. However, domestication and selective breeding have narrowed genetic diversity of modern wheat germplasm, and breeders have relied on wheat relatives for enriching its gene pool through introgression. Translocations where the 1RS chromosome arm was introgressed from rye to wheat have improved yield and resistance against various pathogens. Here, we isolated the Pm17 mildew resistance gene located on the 1RS introgression in wheat cultivar 'Amigo' and found that it is an allele or a close paralog of the Pm8 gene isolated earlier from 'Petkus' rye. Functional validation using transient and stable transformation confirmed the identity of Pm17. Analysis of Pm17 and Pm8 coding regions revealed an overall identity of 82.9% at the protein level, with the LRR domains being most divergent. Our analysis also showed that the two rye genes are much more diverse compared to the variants encoded by the Pm3 gene in wheat, which is orthologous to Pm17/Pm8 as concluded from highly conserved upstream sequences in all these genes. Thus, the evolutionary history of these orthologous loci differs in the cereal species rye and wheat and demonstrates that orthologous resistance genes can take different routes towards functionally active genes. These findings suggest that the isolation of Pm3/Pm8/Pm17 orthologs from other grass species, additional alleles from the rye germplasm as well as possibly synthetic variants will result in novel resistance genes useful in wheat breeding."

"9631014","abstracttext","High-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS), one class of seed storage proteins, are important determinants of the bread-making quality of wheat flour. To change the amount and composition of these proteins via genetic engineering, a gene encoding a novel hybrid subunit under the control of native HMW-GS regulatory sequences was inserted into wheat. Of 26 independent transgenic lines identified by bialaphos selection, 18 expressed the cotransformed hybrid HMW-GS gene in their seed. The hybrid subunit accumulated to levels comparable to those of the native HMW-GS. These results show that a native HMW-GS gene promoter can be used to obtain high levels of expression of seed storage and, potentially, other proteins in transgenic wheat endosperm. Transgene expression was stable for at least three seed generations in the majority of lines. These experiments demonstrate the feasibility of constructing wheat plants with novel seed protein compositions."

"16453710","abstracttext","A gene encoding the small subunit of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcS) in wheat, a monocot plant, was transferred to tobacco, a dicot plant. The wheat gene is not expressed in transgenic tobacco under the control of its own promoter, but when transcription is driven by a viral promoter, several wheat transcripts accumulate. These include both spliced and unspliced transcripts, which are polyadenylated at multiple novel sites in the wheat 3' flanking region. Another monocot intron, from the maize Adh-1 gene, is also spliced inefficiently in tobacco. These findings contrast results demonstrating efficient processing of different rbcS transcripts from pea, a dicot, in transgenic tobacco. This pattern may reflect general differences in sequences required for RNA processing in monocot and dicot plants."

"20849627","abstracttext_results","Affymetrix wheat genome arrays were used for both the discovery of divergent homoeolog-specific mutations and analysis of homoeolog-specific gene expression in re-synthesized allohexaploid wheat.

In re-synthesized polyploid 81% of PSFs detected mid-parent levels of gene expression, and only 19% of PSFs showed the evidence of non-additive expression. Non-additive expression in both AB and D genomes was strongly biased toward up-regulation of parental type of gene expression with only 6% and 11% of genes, respectively, being down-regulated. Of all the non-additive gene expression, 84% can be explained by differences in the parental genotypes used to make the allopolyploid. Homoeolog-specific co-regulation of several functional gene categories was found, particularly genes involved in photosynthesis and protein biosynthesis in wheat."

"15305606","abstracttext","The maize Rp1-D gene confers race-specific resistance against Puccinia sorghi (common leaf rust) isolates containing a corresponding avrRp1-D avirulence gene. An Rp1-D genomic clone and a similar Rp1-D transgene regulated by the maize ubiquitin promoter were transformed independently into susceptible maize lines and shown to confer Rp1-D resistance, demonstrating that this resistance can be transferred as a single gene. Transfer of these functional transgenes into wheat and barley did not result in novel resistances when these plants were challenged with isolates of wheat stem rust (P. graminis), wheat leaf rust (P. triticina), or barley leaf rust (P. hordei). Regardless of the promoter employed, low levels of gene expression were observed. When constitutive promoters were used for transgene expression, a majority of Rp1-D transcripts were truncated in the nucleotide binding site-encoding region by premature polyadenylation. This aberrant mRNA processing was unrelated to gene function because an inactive version of the gene also generated such transcripts. These data demonstrate that resistance gene transfer between species may not be limited only by divergence of signaling effector molecules and pathogen avirulence ligands, but potentially also by more fundamental gene expression and transcript processing limitations."

"17195929","abstracttext","Genetic manipulation using gene cassettes was applied to the elite wheat variety EM12 via particle bombardment, which allows an improvement in transformation frequency. We simultaneously transferred to wheat immature embryos with two non-linked genes, gus and bar, on either separate gene cassettes or one plasmid. The linear gene cassettes were excised and purified by restriction digestion of the plasmid, and consisted of promoters, open reading frames and terminators. No difference was observed in GUS transient expression of between gene cassettes and single whole plasmid. However, the stable transformation frequency was significantly increased to 1.1% using gene cassettes, compared with 0.4% when using single plasmid. Procedures of the efficient co-transformation with gene cassettes were developed. Factors influencing on the transformation frequency were also studied in order to optimize the procedure. These were acceleration pressure, target distance, gold particle size, the quantity ratio of gene cassettes and the age of target explants. Based on the transient and stable expression of the gus gene cassettes, optimization of transformation parameters improved the reproducibility of transformation in the elite wheat variety."

"24065689","abstracttext","A spontaneous dwarf mutant of wheat was found in an F5 generation line derived from a cross between Huamai No. 9 and Een No. 1 in 1998; it was named Huaai 01. We characterized the genetic pattern of Huaai 01 and mapped the gene controlling the dwarf trait. This dwarf mutant was found insensitive to exogenous gibberellic acid treatment, based on the length of the first leaf and the coleoptile at the seedling stage, suggesting that it plays a crucial role in the gibberellin response pathway. Genetic analysis revealed that a single gene that is partially recessive controls the dwarf phenotype in Huaai 01. We named the dwarfing gene Rht-B2. Simple sequence repeats (SSR) were examined as identifying markers linked to the Rht-B2 gene in an F2 population. We screened 904 pairs of primers and identified 5 SSR markers linked to the Rht-B2 gene. Two markers, barc1096 and xgwm495, were located on the flanking region of the Rht-B2 gene at genetic distances of 2.9 and 3.3 cM, respectively. Based on published SSR linkage data for wheat, the Rht-B2 gene was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 4B. This identification and characterization of the Rht-B2 dwarfing gene will facilitate its utilization in wheat breeding."
"9025301","articletitle","Molecular cloning of a new receptor-like kinase gene encoded at the Lr10 disease resistance locus of wheat."
"9025301","abstracttext","More than 100 resistance genes against wheat rust pathogens have been described in wheat and its relatives. Although many of them have been extensively used in wheat resistance breeding, none of these resistance loci has yet been analyzed at the molecular level. By screening a set of near-isogenic lines carrying different leaf rust resistance genes with a wheat probe encoding a serine/ threonine protein kinase, we detected a polymorphic DNA fragment in the line with the Lr10 resistance gene. This fragment mapped to the Lr10 disease resistance locus and encodes a receptor-like protein kinase which we called LRK10. LRK10 contains a new type of extracellular domain not found in known plant or animal receptor kinases. Several conserved amino acids in S-domain glycoproteins and receptor-like kinases were also found in LRK10, suggesting that LRK10 and S-domain proteins belong to the same superfamily of specific recognition molecules in plants. Lrk10 was expressed at low levels in young seedlings and belongs to a gene family. Analysis of wheat lines with and without the Lr10 gene demonstrated that Lrk10 and Lr10 belong to the same genetic locus. We conclude that gene isolation based on protein kinase homology can identify new receptor domains and provide candidates for disease resistance genes in the complex wheat genome."

"19413505","abstracttext","Once it was established that the spaceflight environment was not a drastic impediment to plant growth, a remaining space biology question was whether long-term spaceflight exposure could cause changes in subsequent generations, even if they were returned to a normal Earth environment. In this study, we used a genomic approach to address this question. We tested whether changes in gene expression patterns occur in wheat plants that are several generations removed from growth in space, compared to wheat plants with no spaceflight exposure in their lineage. Wheat flown on Mir for 167 days in 1991 formed viable seeds back on Earth. These seeds were grown on the ground for three additional generations. Gene expression of fourth-generation Mir flight leaves was compared to that of the control leaves by using custom-made wheat microarrays. The data were evaluated using analysis of variance, and transcript abundance of each gene was contrasted among samples with t-tests. After corrections were made for multiple tests, none of the wheat genes represented on the microarrays showed a statistically significant difference in expression between wheat that has spaceflight exposure in their lineage and plants with no spaceflight exposure. This suggests that exposure to the spaceflight environment in low Earth orbit space stations does not cause significant, heritable changes in gene expression patterns in plants."

"26225967","abstracttext","Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), is a globally serious disease adversely affecting wheat production. The Bgt-resistant wheat breeding line CH09W89 was derived after backcrossing a Bgt resistant wheat-Thinopyrum intermedium partial amphiploid TAI7045 with susceptible wheat cultivars. At the seedling stage, CH09W89 exhibited immunity or high resistance to Bgt pathotypes E09, E20, E21, E23, E26, Bg1, and Bg2, similar to its donor line TAI7045 and Th. intermedium. No Th. intermedium chromatin was detected based on genomic in situ hybridization of mitotic chromosomes. To determine the mode of inheritance of the Bgt resistance and the chromosomal location of the resistance gene, CH09W89 was crossed with two susceptible wheat cultivars. The results of the genetic analysis showed that the adult resistance to Bgt E09 in CH09W89 was controlled by a single recessive gene, which was tentatively designated as pmCH89. Two polymorphic SSR markers, Xwmc310 and Xwmc125, were linked to the resistance gene with genetic distances 3.1 and 2.7 cM, respectively. Using the Chinese Spring aneuploid and deletion lines, the resistance gene and its linked markers were assigned to chromosome arm 4BL in the bin 0.68-0.78. Due to its unique position on chromosome 4BL, pmCH89 appears to be a new locus for resistance to powdery mildew. These results will be of benefit for improving powdery mildew resistance in wheat breeding programs."

"29587341","abstracttext","Wheat aphids are major pests during the seed filling stage of wheat. Plant lectins are toxic to sap-sucking pests such as wheat aphids. In this study, Pinellia pedatisecta agglutinin ( ppa ), a gene encoding mannose binding lectin, was cloned, and it shared 92.69% nucleotide similarity and 94% amino acid similarity with Pinellia ternata agglutinin ( pta ). The ppa gene, driven by the constitutive and phloem-specific ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit gene ( rbcs ) promoter in pBAC-rbcs-ppa expression vector, was transferred into the wheat cultivar Baofeng104 (BF104) by particle bombardment transformation. Fifty-four T₀ transgenic plants were generated. The inheritance and expression of the ppa gene were confirmed by PCR and RT-PCR analysis respectively, and seven homozygous transgenic lines were obtained. An aphid bioassay on detached leaf segments revealed that seven ppa transgenic wheat lines had lower aphid growth rates and higher inhibition rates than BF104. Furthermore, two-year aphid bioassays in isolated fields showed that aphid numbers per tiller of transgenic lines were significantly decreased, compared with wild type BF104. Therefore, ppa could be a strong biotechnological candidate to produce aphid-resistant wheat."

"29879135","abstracttext","Puccinia triticina, the causal agent of wheat leaf rust, causes significant losses in wheat yield and quality each year worldwide. During leaf rust infection, the host plant recognizes numerous molecules, some of which trigger host defenses. Although P. triticina reproduces clonally, there is still variation within the population due to a high mutation frequency, host specificity, and environmental adaptation. This study explores how wheat responds on a gene expression level to different P. triticina races. Six P. triticina races were inoculated onto a susceptible wheat variety and samples were taken at six days post inoculation, just prior to pustule eruption. RNA sequence data identified 63 wheat genes differentially expressed between the six races. A time course, conducted over the first seven days post inoculation, was used to examine the expression pattern of 63 genes during infection. Forty-seven wheat genes were verified to have differential expression. Three common expression patterns were identified. In addition, two genes were associated with race specific gene expression. Differential expression of an ER molecular chaperone gene was associated with races from two different P. triticina lineages. Also, differential expression in an alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase gene was associated with races with virulence shifts for leaf rust resistance genes."

"32526612","abstracttext","Monogalactosyl diacylglycerol (MGDG), the main component of the plastid membrane, is essential for chloroplast photosynthesis; however, little information is available about the function of MGDG synthases gene (TaMGD) in wheat grain. In this manuscript, three homologous genes were identified in wheat grain, and their functions were investigated by gene silencing and overexpression techniques. Three TaMGD homologous genes, TaMGD-6A, -6B, and -6D, located on chromosome 6A, 6B, and 6D, respectively, were isolated from common wheat. The transcription of TaMGD was detected in stems, roots, leaves and grains, and high levels of gene transcripts were detected in stems and leaves. Silencing of TaMGD in common wheat spikes resulted in a decrease in grain weight and starch content, and proteomic analysis showed that the differentially expressed proteins mainly included carbohydrate metabolism- and nucleic acid-related proteins. In comparison with wild-type, transgenic rice plants overexpressing TaMGD-6A and -6D showed an increase in thousand kernel weight, as well as an increase in the expression level of genes related to starch biosynthesis, whereas transgenic rice plants overexpressing TaMGD-6B showed increased grain yield and grain number per spike. The results of gene silencing and overexpression indicated that TaMGD plays an important role in wheat grain weight, which might be associated with carbohydrate metabolism. Hence, this study provides new insights regarding the role of TaMGD in wheat grain characteristics."

"12454082","abstracttext","Orthologous regions in barley, rice, sorghum, and wheat were studied by bacterial artificial chromosome sequence analysis. General microcolinearity was observed for the four shared genes in this region. However, three genic rearrangements were observed. First, the rice region contains a cluster of 48 predicted small nucleolar RNA genes, but the comparable region from sorghum contains no homologous loci. Second, gene 2 was inverted in the barley lineage by an apparent unequal recombination after the ancestors of barley and wheat diverged, 11-15 million years ago (mya). Third, gene 4 underwent direct tandem duplication in a common ancestor of barley and wheat 29-41 mya. All four of the shared genes show the same synonymous substitution rate, but nonsynonymous substitution rates show significant variations between genes 4a and 4b, suggesting that gene 4b was largely released from the strong purifying selection that acts on gene 4a in both barley and wheat. Intergenic retrotransposon blocks, many of them organized as nested insertions, mostly account for the lower gene density of the barley and wheat regions. All but two of the retrotransposons were found in the regions between genes, while all but 2 of the 51 inverted repeat transposable elements were found as insertions in genic regions and outside the retrotransposon blocks."

"25608181","abstracttext","Parastagonospora nodorum is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen that causes Septoria nodorum blotch (SNB) (formerly Stagonospora nodorum blotch) on wheat. P. nodorum produces necrotrophic effectors (NE) that are recognized by dominant host sensitivity gene products resulting in disease development. The NE-host interaction is critical to inducing NE-triggered susceptibility (NETS). To date, seven NE-host sensitivity gene interactions, following an inverse gene-for-gene model, have been identified in the P. nodorum-wheat pathosystem. Here, we used a wheat mapping population that segregated for sensitivity to two previously characterized interactions (SnTox1-Snn1 and SnTox3-Snn3-B1) to identify and characterize a new interaction involving the NE designated SnTox6 and the host sensitivity gene designated Snn6. SnTox6 is a small secreted protein that induces necrosis on wheat lines harboring Snn6. Sensitivity to SnTox6, conferred by Snn6, was light-dependent and was shown to underlie a major disease susceptibility quantitative trait locus (QTL). No other QTL were identified, even though the P. nodorum isolate used in this study harbored both the SnTox1 and SnTox3 genes. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that the expression of SnTox1 was not detectable, whereas SnTox3 was expressed and, yet, did not play a significant role in disease development. This work expands our knowledge of the wheat-P. nodorum interaction and further establishes this system as a model for necrotrophic specialist pathosystems."
"29358231","articletitle","An Overexpressed Q Allele Leads to Increased Spike Density and Improved Processing Quality in Common Wheat ( Triticum aestivum )."
"29358231","abstracttext","Spike density and processing quality are important traits in modern wheat production and are controlled by multiple gene loci. The associated genes have been intensively studied and new discoveries have been constantly reported during the past few decades. However, no gene playing a significant role in the development of these two traits has been identified. In the current study, a common wheat mutant with extremely compact spikes and good processing quality was isolated and characterized. A new allele ( Q c1 ) of the Q gene (an important domestication gene) responsible for the mutant phenotype was cloned, and the molecular mechanism for the mutant phenotype was studied. Results revealed that Q c1 originated from a point mutation that interferes with the miRNA172-directed cleavage of Q transcripts, leading to its overexpression. It also reduces the longitudinal cell size of rachises, resulting in an increased spike density. Furthermore, Q c1 increases the number of vascular bundles, which suggests a higher efficiency in the transportation of assimilates in the spikes of the mutant than that of wild type. This accounts for the improved processing quality. The effects of Q c1 on spike density and wheat processing quality were confirmed by analyzing nine common wheat mutants possessing four different Q c alleles. These results deepen our understanding of the key roles of Q gene, and provide new insights for the potential application of Q c alleles in wheat quality breeding."

"28231383","abstracttext","There is an increasing understanding that variation in gene presence-absence plays an important role in the heritability of agronomic traits; however, there have been relatively few studies on variation in gene presence-absence in crop species. Hexaploid wheat is one of the most important food crops in the world and intensive breeding has reduced the genetic diversity of elite cultivars. Major efforts have produced draft genome assemblies for the cultivar Chinese Spring, but it is unknown how well this represents the genome diversity found in current modern elite cultivars. In this study we build an improved reference for Chinese Spring and explore gene diversity across 18 wheat cultivars. We predict a pangenome size of 140 500 ± 102 genes, a core genome of 81 070 ± 1631 genes and an average of 128 656 genes in each cultivar. Functional annotation of the variable gene set suggests that it is enriched for genes that may be associated with important agronomic traits. In addition to variation in gene presence, more than 36 million intervarietal single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified across the pangenome. This study of the wheat pangenome provides insight into genome diversity in elite wheat as a basis for genomics-based improvement of this important crop. A wheat pangenome, GBrowse, is available at http://appliedbioinformatics.com.au/cgi-bin/gb2/gbrowse/WheatPan/, and data are available to download from http://wheatgenome.info/wheat_genome_databases.php."

"28164301","abstracttext","Zymoseptoria tritici is the causal agent of Septoria tritici blotch, a major pathogen of wheat globally and the most damaging pathogen of wheat in Europe. A gene-for-gene (GFG) interaction between Z. tritici and wheat cultivars carrying the Stb6 resistance gene has been postulated for many years, but the genes have not been identified. We identified AvrStb6 by combining quantitative trait locus mapping in a cross between two Swiss strains with a genome-wide association study using a natural population of c. 100 strains from France. We functionally validated AvrStb6 using ectopic transformations. AvrStb6 encodes a small, cysteine-rich, secreted protein that produces an avirulence phenotype on wheat cultivars carrying the Stb6 resistance gene. We found 16 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms among the tested strains, indicating that AvrStb6 is evolving very rapidly. AvrStb6 is located in a highly polymorphic subtelomeric region and is surrounded by transposable elements, which may facilitate its rapid evolution to overcome Stb6 resistance. AvrStb6 is the first avirulence gene to be functionally validated in Z. tritici, contributing to our understanding of avirulence in apoplastic pathogens and the mechanisms underlying GFG interactions between Z. tritici and wheat."

"26241856","abstracttext","The use of crop wild relative species to improve major crops performance is well established. Hordeum chilense has a high potential as a genetic donor to increase the carotenoid content of wheat. Crosses between the 7Hch H. chilense substitution lines in wheat and the wheat pairing homoeologous1b (ph1b) mutant allowed the development of wheat-H. chilense translocation lines for both 7Hchα and 7Hchβ chromosome arms in the wheat background. These translocation lines were characterized by in situ hybridization and using molecular markers. In addition, reverse phase chromatography (HPLC) analysis was carried out to evaluate the carotenoid content and both 7Hchα∙7AL and 7AS∙7Hchβ disomic translocation lines. The carotenoid content in 7Hchα∙7AL and 7AS∙7Hchβ disomic translocation lines was higher than the wheat-7Hch addition line and double amount of carotenoids than the wheat itself. A proteomic analysis confirmed that the presence of chromosome 7Hch introgressions in wheat scarcely altered the proteomic profile of the wheat flour. The Psy1 (Phytoene Synthase1) gene, which is the first committed step in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, was also cytogenetically mapped on the 7Hchα chromosome arm. These new wheat-H. chilense translocation lines can be used as a powerful tool in wheat breeding programs to enrich the diet in bioactive compounds."

"8980534","abstracttext","A clone for an embryoid-abundant, early cysteine-labeled metallothionein (EcMt) gene has been isolated from a wheat pollen embryoid cDNA library. The transcript of this gene was only expressed in embryogenic microspores, pollen embryoids, and developing zygotic embryos of wheat. Accumulation of the EcMt mRNA showed a direct and positive correlation with an increase of the plant hormone, abscisic acid (ABA) in developing pollen embryoids. Treating cultures with an inhibitor of ABA biosynthesis, fluridone, suppressed not only ABA accumulation but also the appearance of the EcMt gene transcript and the ability of microspores to form embryoids. These results suggest that the EcMt gene may act as a molecular marker for pollen embryogenesis because ABA biosynthesis is accompanied by the increased expression of the EcMt transcript that coincides with the differentiation of pollen embryoids in wheat anther cultures."

The presence of an intron in the carrot COXII intron was verified by restriction mapping and hybridization using specific maize and wheat COXII probes. Regions of the carrot COXII intron are homologous to the maize COXII intron and homologous to the wheat COXII intron-insert as demonstrated by hybridization. Homology of these regions was confirmed by sequencing portions of the gene. A comparison of the restriction map of the carrot COXII gene with the restriction maps of the COXII genes from pea, Oenothera, maize, wheat, and rice revealed that the carrot map coincides with the rice restriction map."

"11238418","abstracttext","We have used network analysis to study gene sequences of the Triticum and Aegilops 5S rDNA arrays, as well as the spacers of the 5S-DNA-A1 and 5S-DNA-2 loci. Network analysis describes relationships between 5S rDNA sequences in a more realistic fashion than conventional tree building because it makes fewer assumptions about the direction of evolution, the extent of sexual isolation, and the pattern of ancestry and descent. The networks show that the 5S rDNA sequences of Triticum and Aegilops species are related in a reticulate manner around principal nodal sequences. The spacer networks have multiple principal nodes of considerable antiquity but the gene network has just one principal node, corresponding to the correct gene sequence. The networks enable orthologous groups of spacer sequences to be identified. When orthologs are compared it is seen that the patterns of intra- and interspecific diversity are similar for both genes and spacers. We propose that 5S rDNA arrays combine sequence conservation with a large store of mutant variations, the number of correct gene copies within an array being the result of neutral processes that act on gene and spacer regions together."

"12127786","abstracttext","Mutation of the 16K gene encoded by RNA1 of Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) greatly reduced the levels of viral RNA that accumulated in both infected protoplasts and plants, showing that the 16K cysteine-rich protein (CRP) is required for efficient multiplication of TRV. Overexpression of the 16K protein, either from an additional copy of the gene carried on TRV RNA2 or from a PVX vector, led to an increase in the severity of disease symptoms, suggesting that the protein has a role in the pathogenicity of the virus. Mutation of the 16K gene could be overcome by expression from RNA2 of the Cucumber mosaic virus 2b gene, the Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus 19K gene, or the Barley stripe mosaic virus gammab gene, indicating that the proteins encoded by these diverse genes may have similar functions. One known function of the CMV 2b gene is as a suppressor of posttranscriptional gene silencing, suggesting that the TRV 16K protein may also possess this activity."

"2155710","abstracttext","The wheat mitochondrial (mt) cox3 has been localized and sequenced. The gene exists as a single copy in the wheat mt master chromosome and is transcribed into a single 1.2 kb RNA, whose extremities have been mapped. Comparison of the wheat and Oenothera cox3 sequences gives ambiguous indications concerning the amino acid coded by the codon CGG. Upstream and downstream of the wheat cox3 gene, two short sequences of 43 bp and 69 bp respectively are present, which are almost identical to sequences present in the flanking regions of other plant mitochondrial genes. These common sequences seem to have played a role in the rearrangements which caused sequence divergence of the plant mt genomes during evolution. Furthermore, mapping of wheat and maize cox3 and cob transcripts suggests that some of these common sequences can play a role in the regulation of transcription or processing."
"16682090","articletitle","Genetic engineering of wheat--current challenges and opportunities."
"16682090","abstracttext","Wheat is one of the major staple food crops grown worldwide; however, productivity in cereal crops has not kept pace with the world population growth. A significant increase in wheat production (>40% by 2020) is needed simply to keep up with the growing demand. This increase is unlikely to be achieved by conventional plant breeding methods because of the limited gene pool available. The application of recombinant techniques to improve wheat quality and yield is not only desirable but also has potential to open up new opportunities. Although there has been significant progress in developing gene-transformation technologies for improving these traits, this remains an important challenge for plant biotechnology. Obstacles to translate the full potential of the genomic era to wheat breeding include the need to develop elite wheat varieties without selectable markers, introducing minimal or nil intergenic DNA and social and market issues concerning genetically engineered food products."

The maximum difference between the Hirmand GSP genotype in wheat and the database sequences was 23% in EF109396 and EF109399. Most amino acid variation between the GSP sequences involved the same amino acids. The Nikita rye GSP gene showed 64% identity with DQ269918 and AY667063. The isoelectric point in the GSP of wheat and Lasko triticale was significantly higher than that of rye GSP.

"25226525","abstracttext","Wheat blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, is an important disease across central and southern Brazil. Control has relied mainly on strobilurin fungicides (quinone-outside inhibitors [QoIs]). Here, we report the widespread distribution of QoI resistance in M. oryzae populations sampled from wheat fields and poaceous hosts across central and southern Brazil and the evolution of the cytochrome b (cyt b) gene. Sequence analysis of the cyt b gene distinguished nine haplotypes, with four haplotypes carrying the G143A mutation associated with QoI resistance and two haplotypes shared between isolates sampled from wheat and other poaceous hosts. The frequency of the G143A mutation in the wheat-infecting population increased from 36% in 2005 to 90% in 2012. The G143A mutation was found in many different nuclear genetic backgrounds of M. oryzae. Our findings indicate an urgent need to reexamine the use of strobilurins to manage fungal wheat diseases in Brazil."

"30804501","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is a destructive wheat pathogen. No fully resistant cultivars are available. Knowledge concerning the molecular weapons of F. graminearum to achieve infection remains limited. Here, we report that deletion of the putative secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene cluster fg3_54 compromises the pathogen's ability to infect wheat through cell-to-cell penetration. Ectopic expression of fgm4, a pathway-specific bANK-like regulatory gene, activates the transcription of the fg3_54 cluster in vitro. We identify a linear, C- terminally reduced and D-amino acid residue-rich octapeptide, fusaoctaxin A, as the product of the two nonribosomal peptide synthetases encoded by fg3_54. Chemically-synthesized fusaoctaxin A restores cell-to-cell invasiveness in fg3_54-deleted F. graminearum, and enables colonization of wheat coleoptiles by two Fusarium strains that lack the fg3_54 homolog and are nonpathogenic to wheat. In conclusion, our results identify fusaoctaxin A as a virulence factor required for cell-to-cell invasion of wheat by F. graminearum."

"32273397","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB), a fungal disease caused by Fusarium species that produce food toxins, currently devastates wheat production worldwide, yet few resistance resources have been discovered in wheat germplasm. Here, we cloned the FHB resistance gene Fhb7 by assembling the genome of Thinopyrum elongatum , a species used in wheat distant hybridization breeding. Fhb7 encodes a glutathione S-transferase (GST) and confers broad resistance to Fusarium species by detoxifying trichothecenes through de-epoxidation. Fhb7 GST homologs are absent in plants, and our evidence supports that Th. elongatum has gained Fhb7 through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from an endophytic Epichloë species. Fhb7 introgressions in wheat confers resistance to both FHB and crown rot in diverse wheat backgrounds without yield penalty, providing a solution for Fusarium resistance breeding."

"31109025","abstracttext","Phytases are pro-nutritional enzymes that hydrolyze phytate and make associated nutrients, such as phosphorous, iron, and zinc, bioavailable. Single-stomached animals and humans depend on phytase supplied through the diet or the action of phytase on the food before ingestion. As a result, phytases-or lack thereof-have a profound impact on agricultural ecosystems, resource management, animal health, and public health. Wheat, barley and their Triticeae relatives make exceptionally good natural sources of phytase. This review highlights advances in the understanding of the molecular basis of the phytase activity in wheat and barley, which has taken place over the past decade. It is shown how the phytase activity in the mature grains of wheat and barley can be ascribed to the PAPhy_a gene, which exists as a single gene in barley and in two or three homeologous copies in tetra- and hexaploid wheat, respectively. It is discussed how understanding the function and regulation of PAPhy_a may support the development of improved wheat and barley with even higher phytase activity."

The established DPO-PCR method was highly specific, and there was no cross-reactivity to 22 control samples. The sensitivity was high, and the minimum detection limit was 1 ng/uL. Tests on commercially available product samples showed that the method can effectively detect wheat component of foods. The DPO-PCR method established in this study is simple and accurate, and provides an effective detection method for wheat component in foods."

"32818636","abstracttext","Time-dependent darkening and discoloration of wheat product caused by high polyphenol oxidase enzymes (PPO) activity is the most undesirable character in wheat processing industry. We performed GWAS of PPO activity in wheat grains utilizing an association panel and identified 22 significant SNPs. The most significant GWAS peak on chromosome 2A was verified by QTL analysis of PPO activity. The candidate gene for this GWAS peak was identified as TaPPO2A-1, which was the highest expressed PPO gene in wheat grains. The expression level of TaPPO2A-1 was significantly correlated with PPO activity. The most significant association signal for GWAS of the expression values of TaPPO2A-1 pinpointed to the genomic region containing TaPPO2A-1. The results suggested that cis regulation of TaPPO2A-1 expression is the key factor in regulation of PPO activity in wheat grains. The conclusion was further enhanced by haplotype analysis of seven SNPs in the promoter of TaPPO2A-1."

Here, we investigate endophytism of T. melanosporum and T. aestivum. We visualised endophytic T. melanosporum hyphae by fluorescent in situ hybridisation on nonectomycorrhizal plants. For the two Tuber species, microsatellite genotyping investigated the endophytic presence of the individuals whose mating produced nearby ascocarps. We quantified the expression of four T. aestivum genes in roots of endophyted, non-ectomycorrhizal plants. Tuber melanosporum hyphae colonised the apoplast of healthy roots, confirming endophytism. Endophytic Tuber melanosporum and T. aestivum contributed to nearby ascocarps, but only as maternal parents (forming the flesh). Paternal individuals (giving only genes found in meiotic spores of ascocarps) were not detected. Gene expression of T. aestivum in non-ectomycorrhizal plants confirmed a living status. Tuber species, and likely other ectomycorrhizal fungi found in nonectomycorrhizal plant roots in this study, can be root endophytes. This is relevant for the ecology (brûlé formation) and commercial production of truffles. Evolutionarily speaking, endophytism may be an ancestral trait in some ectomycorrhizal fungi that evolved from root endophytes."

"16529374","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a devastating disease of wheat and barley which causes extensive losses worldwide. Monogenic, gene-for-gene resistance to FHB has not been reported. The best source of resistance to FHB is a complex, quantitative trait derived from the wheat cv. Sumai 3. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis thaliana NPR1 gene (AtNPR1), which regulates the activation of systemic acquired resistance, when expressed in the FHB-susceptible wheat cv. Bobwhite, confers a heritable, type II resistance to FHB caused by Fusarium graminearum. The heightened FHB resistance in the transgenic AtNPRI -expressing wheat is associated with the faster activation of defense response when challenged by the fungus. PR1 expression is induced rapidly to a high level in the fungus-challenged spikes of the AtNPR1-expressing wheat. Furthermore, benzothiadiazole, a functional analog of salicylic acid, induced PR1 expression faster and to a higher level in the AtNPR1-expressing wheat than in the nontransgenic plants. We suggest that FHB resistance in the AtNPR1-expressing wheat is a result of these plants being more responsive to an endogenous activator of plant defense. Our results demonstrate that NPR1 is an effective candidate for controlling FHB."

"17720914","abstracttext","The Pm3 gene from wheat confers resistance against powdery mildew and recent studies have shown that it is a member of a multigene family in the wheat genome. We compared genomic sequences ranging from 178 to 332 kb containing six Pm3-like genes and five gene fragments from orthologous loci in the A genome of wheat at three different ploidy levels. We found that the wheat Pm3 loci display an extremely dynamic evolution where sequence conservation is minimal between species and basically limited to very short sequences containing the genetic markers that define the orthology. The Pm3-like genes and their up- and downstream regions were reshuffled by multiple rearrangements, resulting in a complex mosaic of conserved and unique sequences. Comparison with rice showed that the known wheat Pm3-like genes represent only one branch of a large superfamily with several clusters in rice and suggests the presence of additional similar genes in the wheat genome. Estimates of divergence times and transposable-element insertions indicate that the Pm3 locus in wheat has undergone more drastic changes in its recent evolution than its counterpart in rice. This indicates that loci containing homologous resistance gene analogs can evolve at highly variable speeds in different species."

"29959585","abstracttext_key message","Hexaploid bread wheat is not readily amenable to traditional mutagenesis approaches. In this study, we show efficient utilization of CRISPR-Cas system and Next Generation Sequencing for mutant analysis in wheat. Identification and manipulation of male fertility genes in hexaploid bread wheat is important for understanding the molecular basis of pollen development and to obtain novel sources of nuclear genetic male sterility (NGMS). The maize Male sterile 45 (Ms45) gene encodes a strictosidine synthase-like enzyme and has been shown to be required for male fertility. To investigate the role of Ms45 gene in wheat, mutations in the A, B and D homeologs were produced using CRISPR-Cas9. A variety of mutations in the three homeologs were recovered, including a plant from two different genotypes each with mutations in all three homeologs. Genetic analysis of the mutations demonstrated that all three wheat Ms45 homeologs contribute to male fertility and that triple homozygous mutants are required to abort pollen development and achieve male sterility. Further, it was demonstrated that a wild-type copy of Ms45 gene from rice was able to restore fertility to these wheat mutant plants. Taken together, these observations provide insights into the conservation of MS45 function in a polyploid species. Ms45 based NGMS can be potentially utilized for a Seed Production Technology (SPT)-like hybrid seed production system in wheat."

"30399543","abstracttext","In the interaction between wheat and Puccinia triticina, wheat resists the invasion of P. triticina by producing hypersensitive reaction-programmed cell death (HR-PCD). To better understand the mechanism of wheat resistance to P. triticina, it is important to identify the defensive genes involved in wheat resistance to leaf rust. This paper systematically presented the role of Wrab17 in the HR-PCD process in wheat after infection by P. triticina. The subcellular location analysis is performed using the full length of Wrab17 coding sequences and Wrab17 is found to be localized in cell nucleus and cytoplasm. Quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis showed that expression of Wrab17 at both mRNA and protein levels increased by P. triticina infection, indicating that the Wrab17 gene participated in the interaction between wheat and P. triticina. Wrab17 knockdown plants were generated by RNA-mediated gene silencing technology (RNA interference, RNAi) and confirmed by southern blot. Further analysis with P. triticina inoculation found that knockdown of Wrab17 exhibited decreased HR expansion area in incompatible combination (L10×260) and significant higher sensitivity to the compatible pathogen P. triticina race 165. In all, this work reports that Wrab17 is a new defensive gene playing a role in wheat resistance to leaf rust."

The introgressed chromosome fragment was tagged using amplified fragment-length polymorphism-derived sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers and intron targeting markers, indicating that CH4131 and CH4132 both possess a homologous group 3 chromatin of Th. intermedium . Genomic in situ hybridization results suggested that a very small Th. intermedium chromosome segment was translocated to the terminal region of wheat 1BS for both lines, forming a configuration of T3Ai-1BS.1BL. The two translocation lines were resistant to stripe rust, and the resistance gene, temporarily designated YrCH-1BS , was likely derived from Th. intermedium . The translocated chromosome fragments have no genetic linkage drag to agronomic performance. The grain quality indexes of these two translocations were higher than local wheat varieties. Therefore, CH4131 and CH4132 could be used as potential gene sources in wheat improvement programs. The SCAR markers are useful to select stripe rust resistance from Th. intermedium ."

"8437584","abstracttext","By screening a wheat mitoplast cDNA bank, we have identified an open reading frame of 444 bp that has a derived amino acid sequence homologous to bacterial-type S7 ribosomal proteins. This gene, designated rps7, is located upstream of one of two 26S rRNA gene copies in the wheat mitochondrial genome and is expressed as an abundant mRNA of approximately 0.7 kb. Its 5' terminus maps to the end of an 80 bp element that is closely related to sequences preceding the wheat coxII, orf25 and atp6 genes. Southern hybridization analysis indicates that rps7-homologous sequences are present in the mitochondria of rice and pea, but not soybean."

"21344312","abstracttext","Wheat vacuolar H+-ATPases (V-ATPase) subunit B, named TaVB, was isolated from the salt-tolerant wheat RH8706-49 and used to transform Arabidopsis plants. TaVB-expressed Arabidopsis has a higher germination rate, root length, V-H+-ATPase activity, and overall salt tolerance than the wild type, indicating that expression of the gene can affect salt tolerance of the transgenic plants. Under salt stress, intracellular Na+ levels in transgenic plants are significantly lower than the control. These results suggest that expression of the wheat TaVB gene may enhance plant tolerance to salt stress."

"6354990","articletitle","Genetics and evolution of multilocus isozymes in hexaploid wheat."
"6354990","abstracttext","Aneuploid genetic studies of isozyme variation in cv Chinese Spring have disclosed that numerous enzymes of hexaploid wheat exist in multiple molecular forms as a direct consequence of polyploidy. Sixty-nine isozyme structural genes have been identified to date. Two of these belong to a duplicate set and at least 54 to triplicate sets of paralogous genes that are located one each in related chromosomes in different genomes. Each of these gene sets encodes either two or three isozymes. The role of regional gene duplication in the production of multilocus isozymes in hexaploid wheat is as yet poorly understood, although a considerable amount of indirect evidence suggests that a large number of isozymes are encoded by genes that were produced by ancient regional gene duplication events in a genome ancestral to the genomes now present in the species. A full assessment of the role of regional gene duplication in the production of hexaploid wheat isozymes must await further studies. The isozyme structural gene locations thus far determined indicate that the gene synteny relationships that existed in the ancestral wheat genome are in large part conserved in each of the three genomes of cv Chinese Spring and that the genetic content of most individual chromosome arms has also been in large part conserved."

"25116148","abstracttext_key message","A gene conferring seedling resistance to Puccinia triticina was mapped to chromosome 2BS in the wheat Morocco. The gene was shown to be distinct and was therefore designated Lr73. The wheat genotype Morocco, widely susceptible to isolates of Puccinia triticina, was resistant to an Australian isolate of this pathogen collected in 2004. Genetic studies established that the resistance in Morocco was also present the Australian wheat genotypes Avocet, Halberd, Harrier, Tincurrin and a selection of cultivar Warigal lacking the resistance gene Lr20. Genetic studies based on a cross with Halberd showed that the gene is dominant and located on chromosome 2BS (XwPt8760-4 cM-Lr73-1.4 cM-XwPt8235). The gene was genetically independent of the Lr13, Lr16 and Lr23 loci, also located on chromosome 2BS, indicating that it is distinct. The locus designation Lr73 was therefore assigned. On the basis of multi-pathotype tests, it is likely Lr73 is also present in the Australian wheat cultivars Clearfield STL, Federation (with Lr10), Gatcher (with Lr10 and Lr27+Lr31), Marombi (with Lr1 and Lr37), Pugsley (with Lr1 and Lr37), Spear (with Lr1), Stiletto and Tarsa (with Lr1). Gene Lr73 is unlikely to be of value in resistance breeding. However, recognising Lr73 is important to avoid its inadvertent selection in breeding programmes. Furthermore, the apparent rarity of avirulence for genes like Lr73, sometimes referred to as ""fossil"" resistance genes, makes them of interest in terms of the evolution of disease resistance in host plants and of virulence in the respective rust pathogens."

All exons are separated by group-II introns. A trans-splicing event is required to join exons B and C. Putative splicing intermediates were identified by transcriptional analysis of the nad2 gene. The complexity of organization of the nad2 gene is completely conserved even in one of the smallest mitochondrial genomes of higher plants."

"23665877","abstracttext","The emergence of new sequencing technologies has provided fast and cost-efficient strategies for high-resolution mapping of complex genomes. Although these approaches hold great promise to accelerate genome analysis, their application in studying genetic variation in wheat has been hindered by the complexity of its polyploid genome. Here, we applied the next-generation sequencing of a wheat doubled-haploid mapping population for high-resolution gene mapping and tested its utility for ordering shotgun sequence contigs of a flow-sorted wheat chromosome. A bioinformatical pipeline was developed for reliable variant analysis of sequence data generated for polyploid wheat mapping populations. The results of variant mapping were consistent with the results obtained using the wheat 9000 SNP iSelect assay. A reference map of the wheat genome integrating 2740 gene-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms from the wheat iSelect assay, 1351 diversity array technology, 118 simple sequence repeat/sequence-tagged sites, and 416,856 genotyping-by-sequencing markers was developed. By analyzing the sequenced megabase-size regions of the wheat genome we showed that mapped markers are located within 40-100 kb from genes providing a possibility for high-resolution mapping at the level of a single gene. In our population, gene loci controlling a seed color phenotype cosegregated with 2459 markers including one that was located within the red seed color gene. We demonstrate that the high-density reference map presented here is a useful resource for gene mapping and linking physical and genetic maps of the wheat genome."

"25862680","abstracttext_key message","Making use of wheat chromosomal resources, we developed 11 gene-associated markers for the region of interest, which allowed reducing gene interval and spanning it by four BAC clones. Positional gene cloning and targeted marker development in bread wheat are hampered by high complexity and polyploidy of its nuclear genome. Aiming to clone a Russian wheat aphid resistance gene Dn2401 located on wheat chromosome arm 7DS, we have developed a strategy overcoming problems due to polyploidy and enabling efficient development of gene-associated markers from the region of interest. We employed information gathered by GenomeZipper, a synteny-based tool combining sequence data of rice, Brachypodium, sorghum and barley, and took advantage of a high-density linkage map of Aegilops tauschii. To ensure genome- and locus-specificity of markers, we made use of survey sequence assemblies of isolated wheat chromosomes 7A, 7B and 7D. Despite the low level of polymorphism of the wheat D subgenome, our approach allowed us to add in an efficient and cost-effective manner 11 new gene-associated markers in the Dn2401 region and narrow down the target interval to 0.83 cM. Screening 7DS-specific BAC library with the flanking markers revealed a contig of four BAC clones that span the Dn2401 region in wheat cultivar 'Chinese Spring'. With the availability of sequence assemblies and GenomeZippers for each of the wheat chromosome arms, the proposed strategy can be applied for focused marker development in any region of the wheat genome."

In spite of polyploidization events within the latter, studies have shown that genotypically and phenotypically these species are very closely related and, indeed, fertile hybrids can be created by interbreeding. The advent of two genome-scale Affymetrix GeneChips now allows studies of the comparison of their transcriptomes."
"19558723","abstracttext_results","We have used the Wheat GeneChip to create a ""gene expression atlas"" for the wheat transcriptome (cv. Chinese Spring). For this, we chose mRNA from a range of tissues and developmental stages closely mirroring a comparable study carried out for barley (cv. Morex) using the Barley1 GeneChip. This, together with large-scale clustering of the probesets from the two GeneChips into ""homologous groups"", has allowed us to perform a genomic-scale comparative study of expression patterns in these two species. We explore the influence of the polyploidy of wheat on the results obtained with the Wheat GeneChip and quantify the correlation between conservation in gene sequence and gene expression in wheat and barley. In addition, we show how the conservation of expression patterns can be used to elucidate, probeset by probeset, the reliability of the Wheat GeneChip."
"19558723","abstracttext_conclusion","While there are many differences in expression on the level of individual genes and tissues, we demonstrate that the wheat and barley transcriptomes appear highly correlated. This finding is significant not only because given small evolutionary distance between the two species it is widely expected, but also because it demonstrates that it is possible to use the two GeneChips for comparative studies. This is the case even though their probeset composition reflects rather different design principles as well as, of course, the present incomplete knowledge of the gene content of the two species. We also show that, in general, the Wheat GeneChip is not able to distinguish contributions from individual homoeologs. Furthermore, the comparison between the two species leads us to conclude that the conservation of both gene sequence as well as gene expression is positively correlated with absolute expression levels, presumably reflecting increased selection pressure on genes coding for proteins present at high levels. In addition, the results indicate the presence of a correlation between sequence and expression conservation within the Triticeae."

In this article, we discuss the utilization of RNAi in wheat functional gene analysis and its effect on transcript regulation of homoeologous genes. We also review recent examples of RNAi modification of important agronomic and quality traits in wheat and discuss future directions for this technology."

Further, cDNA cloning in conjunction with Southern and Northern analyses indicate that wheat has a cor gene that is related to Arabidopsis cor47, a gene encoding a 47 kilodalton ;boiling-stable' COR polypeptide. We suggest it is likely that the boiling-stable COR polypeptides have a fundamental role in plants acclimating to cold temperatures and discuss the possibility that they may act as cryoprotectants."

"31981185","abstracttext","Seedling resistance to leaf rust available in the synthetic hexaploid wheat line Syn137 was characterised by means of cytogenetic and linkage mapping. Monosomic analysis located a single dominant gene for leaf rust resistance on chromosome 5D. Molecular mapping not only confirmed this location but also positioned the gene to the distal part of the long arm of chromosome 5D. A test of allelism showed that the gene, tentatively named LrSyn137, is independent but closely linked to Lr1. It appears that Syn137 is occasionally heterogeneous for Lr1 since the analysis of the Lr1-specific marker RGA567-5 in the genetic mapping population indicated the presence of Lr1. Syn137 represents another source of genetic variation that can be useful for the diversification of leaf rust resistance in wheat cultivars."

"26470192","abstracttext","A key component of Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov), management has been through planting resistant wheat cultivars. A new biotype, RWA2, appeared in 2003 which caused widespread damage to wheat cultivars containing the Dn4 gene. Biotypic diversity in Russian wheat aphid populations has not been addressed since 2005 when RWA2 dominated the biotype complex. Our objectives were to determine the biotypic diversity in the Central Great Plains and Colorado Plateau at regional (2010, 2011, 2013) and local (2012) levels and detect the presence of new Russian wheat aphid biotypes. Regional and within-field aphid collections were screened against Russian wheat aphid-resistant wheat genotypes containing genes Dn3, Dn4, Dn6, Dn7, Dn9, CI2401; and resistant barley STARS 9301B. In 2010, all aphid collections from Texas were avirulent to the Dn4 resistance gene in wheat. Regional results revealed Dn4 avirulent RWA6 was widespread (55-84%) in populations infesting wheat in both regions. Biotypes RWA1, 2, and 3/7 were equally represented with percentages<20% each while RWA8 was rarely detected. Combining percentages of RWA1, 6, and 8 across regions to estimate avirulence to Dn4 gene revealed high percentages for both 2011 (64-80%) and 2013 (69-90%). In contrast, the biotype structure at the local level differed where biotype percentages varied up to ≥2-fold between fields. No new biotypes were detected; therefore, Dn7, CI2401, and STARS9301B remained resistant to all known Russian wheat aphid biotypes. This study documents a shift to Dn4 avirulent biotypes and serves as a valuable baseline for biotypic diversity in Russian wheat aphid populations prior to the deployment of new Russian wheat aphid-resistant wheat cultivars."

"18438437","abstracttext","Chromosome 1R of rye is a useful source of genes for disease resistance and enhanced agronomic performance in wheat. One of the most prevalent genes transferred to wheat from rye is the stem rust resistance gene Sr31. The recent emergence and spread of a stem rust pathotype virulent to this gene has refocused efforts to find and utilize alternative sources of resistance. There has been considerable effort to transfer a stem rust resistance gene, SrR, from Imperial rye, believed to be allelic to Sr31, into commercial wheat cultivars. However, the simultaneous transfer of genes at the Sec-1 locus encoding secalin seed storage proteins and their association with quality defects preclude the deployment of SrR in some commercial wheat breeding programs. Previous attempts to induce homoeologous recombination between wheat and rye chromosomes to break the linkage between SrR and Sec-1 whilst retaining the tightly linked major loci for wheat seed storage proteins, Gli-D1 and Glu-D3, and recover good dough quality characteristics, have been unsuccessful. We produced novel tertiary wheat-rye recombinant lines carrying different lengths of rye chromosome arm 1RS by inducing homoeologous recombination between the wheat 1D chromosome and a previously described secondary wheat-rye recombinant, DRA-1. Tertiary recombinant T6-1 (SrR+ Sec-1-) carries the target gene for stem rust resistance from rye and retains Gli-D1 but lacks the secalin locus. The tertiary recombinant T49-7 (SrR- Sec-1+) contains the secalin locus but lacks the stem rust resistance gene. T6-1 is expected to contribute to wheat breeding programs in Australia, whereas T49-7 provides opportunities to investigate whether the presence of secalins is responsible for the previously documented dough quality defects."

"30791662","abstracttext","Drought and heat factors have negative impacts on wheat yield and growth worldwide. Improving wheat tolerance to heat and drought stress is of the utmost importance to maintain crop yield. WRKY transcription factors help improve plant resistance to environmental factors. In this investigation, Arabidopsis WRKY30 ( AtWRKY30 ) transcription factor was cloned and expressed in wheat. Plants growth, biomass, gas-exchange attributes, chlorophyll content, relative water content, prolines content, soluble proteins content, soluble sugars content, and antioxidant enzymes activities (catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POX), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX)) of the AtWRKY30 -overexpressing wheat plants were higher than those of the wild type. However, levels of electrolyte leakage, malondialdehyde, and hydrogen peroxide of the AtWRKY30 -overexpressing wheat plants were significantly less than those of the wild-type. Additionally, the expression level of antioxidant enzyme-encoding genes and stress-responsive genes (ERF5a, DREB1, DREB3, WRKY19, TIP2, and AQP7) were significantly induced in the transgenic wheat plants in comparison with the wild type. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that AtWRKY30 overexpression promotes heat and drought tolerance in wheat by inducing gas-exchange attributes, antioxidant machinery, osmolytes biosynthesis, and stress-related gene expression. AtWRKY30 could serve as a potential candidate gene for improving stress tolerance in wheat."

"31168798","abstracttext","De-domestication is a unique evolutionary process during which crops re-acquire wild-like traits to survive and persist in agricultural fields without the need for human cultivation. The re-acquisition of seed dispersal mechanisms is crucial for crop de-domestication. Common wheat is an important cereal crop worldwide. Tibetan semi-wild wheat is a potential de-domesticated common wheat subspecies. However, the crucial genes responsible for its brittle rachis trait have not been identified. Genetic mapping, functional analyses and phylogenetic analyses were completed to identify the gene associated with Qbr.sau-5A, which is a major locus for the brittle rachis trait of Tibetan semi-wild wheat. The cloned Qbr.sau-5A gene is a new Q allele (Q t ) with a 161-bp transposon insertion in exon 5. Although Q t is expressed normally, its encoded peptide lacks some key features of the APETALA2 family. The abnormal functions of Q t in developing wheat spikes result in brittle rachises. Phylogenetic and genotyping analyses confirmed that Q t originated from Q in common wheat and is naturally distributed only in Tibetan semi-wild wheat populations. The identification of Q t provides new evidence regarding the origin of Tibetan semi-wild wheat, and new insights into the re-acquisition of wild traits during crop de-domestication."

The genes were detected in 16 plant species that cover 12 subclasses of the Takhtajan system of angiosperms classification including diverse model species. The results of Southern blot analysis showed a low copy number of this gene existed in rice, wheat, barley and Arabidopsis. The hybridization result of PCR products demonstrated the conservation of the gene corresponding to ver203 in diverse plants. The phylogenetic tree of the ver203 gene in tested plants was supported by evolution relationship of species. The ver203 gene expressed in a vernalized plumule winter wheat, instead of the root. And the endosperm before the treatment was essential for the ver203 expression during vernalization in wheat. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the pattern of expression showed that the gene corresponding to ver203 was expressed at low temperature for 14 days. Gibberellin (GA3) may accelerate the expression of ver203 gene in Arabidopsis exposed to low temperature. However, it could not replace vernalization treatment to initiate the gene expression."

Disease phenotyping was done in controlled environmental conditions by inoculating the population with the most virulent pathotype, 121 R63-1 of Puccinia triticina. One RAPD marker, S5550, located at a distance of 0.8+/-0.008 cM from the Lr9 locus, was converted to sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker SCS5550. The SCAR marker was validated for its specificity to gene Lr9 against 44 of the 50 known Lr genes and 10 wheat cultivars possessing the gene Lr9. Marker SCS5550 was used with another SCAR marker, SCS73719, previously identified as being linked to gene Lr24 on a segregating F2 population to select for genes Lr9 and Lr24, respectively, demonstrating the utility of the 2 markers in marker-assisted gene pyramiding for leaf-rust resistance in wheat."

"17573802","abstracttext","We recently showed that the wheat pathogen Stagonospora nodorum produces proteinaceous host-selective toxins (HSTs). These toxins include SnTox1 as well as SnToxA, a HST first identified from Pyrenophora tritici-repentis that was implicated in a very recent horizontal gene transfer event from S. nodorum to P. tritici-repentis. Compelling evidence implicating SnToxA and SnTox1 in disease development has been obtained. Here, we report the partial purification and characterization of a third HST designated SnTox2, as well as the genetic characterization of the corresponding host-sensitivity gene. SnTox2 was protease sensitive and is estimated between 7 and 10 kDa in size. Sensitivity to SnTox2 was conferred by a single dominant gene designated Snn2, which mapped to the short arm of wheat chromosome 2D. Genetic analysis of reaction to conidial inoculations in a segregating wheat population indicated that both the Snn2-SnTox2 and the Tsn1-SnToxA interactions were involved in disease development, and together they accounted for the majority of the phenotypic variation. Therefore, S. nodorum produces multiple toxins that rely on specific interactions with host gene products to cause disease. The identification of multiple HST-host gene interactions important for disease development and the availability of the S. nodorum whole genome sequence indicate the potential for this pathosystem to serve as a toxin-based, inverse gene-for-gene model."

We found 23 clones with similarity to the Cre3 gene with predicted NBS and LRR domains, and 50 clones with serine/threonine kinase function and similarity to the new receptor-like kinase gene Lrk10 from wheat. In those two groups of clones some conservative nucleotide sequences were identified. Two sequences are identical between the majority of resistance gene candidate clones with a high similarity to Lrk10, and two sequences are identical between the majority of resistance gene candidate clones with similarity to the Cre3 gene."
"10393983","articletitle","High gene density is conserved at syntenic loci of small and large grass genomes."
"10393983","abstracttext","Comparative genomic analysis at the genetic-map level has shown extensive conservation of the gene order between the different grass genomes in many chromosomal regions. However, little is known about the gene organization in grass genomes at the microlevel. Comparison of gene-coding regions between maize, rice, and sorghum showed that the distance between the genes is correlated with the genome size. We have investigated the microcolinearity at Lrk gene loci in the genomes of four grass species: wheat, barley, maize, and rice. The Lrk genes, which encode receptor-like kinases, were found to be consistently associated with another type of receptor-like kinase (Tak) on chromosome groups 1 and 3 in Triticeae and on chromosomes homoeologous to Triticeae group 3 in the other grass genomes. On Triticeae chromosome group 1, Tak and Lrk together with genes putatively encoding NBS/LRR proteins form a cluster of genes possibly involved in signal transduction. Comparison of the gene composition at orthologous Lrk loci in wheat, barley, and rice revealed a maximal gene density of one gene per 4-5 kb, very similar to the gene density in Arabidopsis thaliana. We conclude that small and large grass genomes contain regions that are highly enriched in genes with very little or no repetitive DNA. The comparison of the gene organization suggested various genome rearrangements during the evolution of the different grass species."

"19009447","abstracttext","Down-regulation of endogenous genes via post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) is a key to the characterization of gene function in plants. Many RNA-based silencing mechanisms such as post-transcriptional gene silencing, co-suppression, quelling, and RNA interference (RNAi) have been discovered among species of different kingdoms (plants, fungi, and animals). One of the most interesting discover ies was RNAi, a sequence-specific gene-silencing mechanism initiated by the introduction of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), homologous in sequence to the silenced gene, which triggers degradation of mRNA. Infection of plants with modified viruses can also induce RNA silencing and is referred to as virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS). In contrast to insertional mutagenesis, these emerging new reverse genetic approaches represent a powerful tool for exploring gene function and for manipulating gene expression experimentally in cereal species such as barley and wheat. We examined how RNAi and VIGS have been used to assess gene function in barley and wheat, including molecular mechanisms involved in the process and available methodological elements, such as vectors, inoculation procedures, and analysis of silenced phenotypes."

"22264072","abstracttext","Partial sequencing of the γ-gliadin gene of 62 spelt and 14 soft wheat cultivars was performed. Fifty-six of the 62 spelt cultivars and 13 of the 14 soft wheat cultivars were shown to exhibit the typical spelt or soft wheat γ-gliadin sequence, respectively. Exceptions were ascribed to crossbreeding of soft wheat and spelt. Using the typical soft wheat γ-gliadin sequence, two alternative DNA-based analytical methods were developed for the detection and quantification of spelt flour ""adulteration"" with soft wheat. A simple and fast detection of soft wheat in spelt flours could be achieved by restriction fragment length (RFLP) analysis. In combination with lab-on-a-chip capillary gel electrophoresis (LOC-CE) the soft wheat proportion could be estimated. Heteroduplex formation served as additional confirmation for the presence of spelt besides soft wheat. Hence, RFLP-LOC-CE constitutes a perfect analysis tool for the quality control of cereal seeds and pure cultivars. A precise quantification of soft wheat ""adulterations"" in spelt flour down to 1% could be achieved by the developed real-time PCR method. The calibration parameters of the real-time PCR assay fulfilled the minimum performance requirements of the European Network of GMO (genetically modified organisms) Laboratories (ENGL)."

"23154758","abstracttext","A PCR-based method was developed to distinguish between durum/common wheat and common wheat by leveraging slight differences of DNA sequence in Starch Synthase II (SS II) coded on wheat A, B and D genomes. A primer pair, SS II ex7-U/L, was designed to hybridize with a conserved DNA sequence region found in SS II-A, B and D genes. Another primer pair, SS II-D 1769U/1889L, was constructed to recognize a unique sequence in the SS II-D gene. The target region of SS II ex7-U/L with the size of 114 bp was amplified from durum and common wheat DNA, while no amplification was observed from any cereals other than those in the wheat genus. A DNA fragment with the size of 121 bp was specifically amplified from common wheat with SS II-D 1769U/1889L. In blended flour prepared from wheat and other cereals, the developed PCR system composed of two primer pairs effectively detected durum/common wheat and common wheat. These results suggested that PCR using two primer pairs is useful for detecting common and/or durum wheat in blended flour and could be utilized to ensure accurate food labeling."

"32272895","abstracttext_background","Leaf and stripe rusts are two major wheat diseases, causing significant yield losses. The preferred way for protecting wheat from rust pathogens is by introgression of rust resistance traits from wheat-related wild species. To avoid genetic drag due to replacement of large wheat chromosomal segments by the alien chromatin, it is necessary to shorten the alien chromosome segment in primary recombinants."
"32272895","abstracttext_results","Here we report on shortening of an alien chromosome segment in wheat that carries leaf and stripe rust resistance from Sharon goatgrass (Aegilops sharonensis). Rust resistant wheat introgression lines were selected and the alien region was mapped using genotyping by sequencing. Single polymorphic nucleotides (SNP) were identified and used to generate diagnostic PCR markers. Shortening of the alien fragment was achieved by induced homoeologous pairing and lines with shortened alien chromosome were identified using the PCR markers. Further reduction of the segment was achieved in tertiary recombinants without losing the rust resistance."
"32272895","abstracttext_conclusions","Alien chromatin in wheat with novel rust resistance genes was characterized by SNP markers and shortened by homoeologous recombination to avoid deleterious traits. The resulting wheat lines are resistant to highly virulent races of leaf and stripe rust pathogens and can be used as both resistant wheat in the field and source for gene transfer to other wheat lines/species."

"31350929","abstracttext","Tillering is a significant agronomic trait in wheat which shapes plant architecture and yield. Strigolactones (SLs) function in inhibiting axillary bud outgrowth. The roles of SLs in the regulation of bud outgrowth have been described in model plant species, including rice and Arabidopsis. However, the role of SLs genes in wheat remains elusive due to the size and complexity of the wheat genomes. In this study, TaD27 genes in wheat, orthologs of rice D27 encoding an enzyme involved in SLs biosynthesis, were identified. TaD27-RNAi wheat plants had more tillers, and TaD27-B-OE wheat plants had fewer tillers. Germination bioassay of Orobanche confirmed the SLs was deficient in TaD27-RNAi and excessive in TaD27-B-OE wheat plants. Moreover, application of exogenous GR24 or TIS108 could mediate the axillary bud outgrowth of TaD27-RNAi and TaD27-B-OE in the hydroponic culture, suggesting that TaD27-B plays critical roles in regulating wheat tiller number by participating in SLs biosynthesis. Unlike rice D27, plant height was not affected in the transgenic wheat plants. Transcription and gene coexpression network analysis showed that a number of genes are involved in the SLs signalling pathway and axillary bud development. Our results indicate that TaD27-B is a key factor in the regulation of tiller number in wheat."

"31355733","abstracttext","In Ethiopia, breeding rust resistant wheat cultivars is a priority for wheat production. A stem rust epidemic during 2013 to 2014 on previously resistant cultivar Digalu highlighted the need to determine the effectiveness of wheat lines to multiple races of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici in Ethiopia. During 2014 and 2015, we evaluated a total of 97 bread wheat and 14 durum wheat genotypes against four P. graminis f. sp. tritici races at the seedling stage and in single-race field nurseries. Resistance genes were postulated using molecular marker assays. Bread wheat lines were resistant to race JRCQC, the race most virulent to durum wheat. Lines with stem rust resistance gene Sr24 possessed the most effective resistance to the four races. Only three lines with adult plant resistance possessed resistance effective to the four races comparable with cultivars with Sr24 . Although responses of the wheat lines across races were positively correlated, wheat lines were identified that possessed adult plant resistance to race TTKSK but were relatively susceptible to race TKTTF. This study demonstrated the importance of testing wheat lines for response to multiple races of the stem rust pathogen to determine if lines possessed non-race-specific resistance.

Its derived protein sequence shares 88% and 75% amino acid identity with those of maize and tobacco mitochondria, respectively.

The wheat orf25 gene is actively transcribed and is preceded by a regulatory sequence block very similar to those located upstream of the wheat coxII and atp6 genes. Our observations support the view that orf25 sequences encode a functional polypeptide in plant mitochondria."

It showed: association of centromeres during pre-meiotic interphase; decondensation of centromeric structure; sister chromatid disjunction of univalent chromosomes in homoeologous pairing situations at anaphase I; and centromeric stretching between univalent sister chromatids in wheat/rye hybrids deficient for pairing genes.

"22127172","abstracttext","Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov)(Russian wheat aphid) has severe economic impacts on wheat and barley production in the United States. The interaction between the Russian wheat aphid and its cereal hosts is poorly understood. However, the recent appearance of new biotypes in the United States showed that specific interactions exist between wheat resistance loci and Russian wheat aphid biotypes. At present, Dn7 is the only known gene in hexaploid wheat that confers resistance against all U.S. Russian wheat aphid biotypes. This study was conducted to investigate the molecular mechanism of Dn7-mediated resistance against two U.S. Russian wheat aphid biotypes (Russian wheat aphid 1 and Russian wheat aphid 2). Using GeneChip Wheat Genome Arrays, we compared transcript profiles of resistant and susceptible lines infested with either Russian wheat aphid 1 or Russian wheat aphid 2 using two time intervals (5 and 48 h after infestation). Russian wheat aphid feeding on hexaploid wheat led to the induction of groups of genes functioning in oxidative and general stress, photosynthesis, cell respiration and energy production, signal transduction, calcium-dependent signaling, pathogenesis related (PR) responses, and defense compound synthesis. The number of differentially expressed genes was higher in plants infested with Russian wheat aphid 1 compared with those infested with Russian wheat aphid 2. Although most genes involved in basic cellular functions were shared, unique genes were also obtained. This finding may indicate subtle differences in genes induced in response to different virulence proteins."

"7921643","abstracttext","Homoeologous relationships between the arms of wheat group 2 chromosomes were analysed by studying homoeologous pairing in wheat-rye hybrids. Chromosomes 2A and 2D were identified using telocentrics 2AS, 2DS or 2DL. The remaining wheat chromosomes and their arms were identified by C-banding. Wheat chromosomes in the hybrids were derived from plants which were heterozygous (Ph1/ph1b) and monotelocentric for 2AS, 2DS or 2DL. In these plants, chromosome 2B and the telocentric showed regular bivalent pairing. From the results of homoeologous pairing in wheat-rye hybrids, normal homoeologous relationships between 2AS, 2BS and 2DS, as well as between 2AL, 2BL and 2DL, were deduced. There was no evidence that wheat group 2 chromosomes were involved in evolutionary chromosome rearrangements. The existence of a pairing promoter gene on chromosome arm 2DS was supported."

Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of seed dormancy is critical for improving the tolerance of wheat seeds to preharvest sprouting. The dataset were generated using oxidized mRNA samples derived from three independent biological replicates of dormant and after-ripened (non-dormant) wheat seeds and a microarray based experimental procedures that involved the use of Affymetrix GeneChip Wheat Genome Array.

We named this wheat mitochondrial gene as nad9. The wheat nad9 gene is transcribed in a single mRNA of 0.9 kb that is edited (C-to-U conversions) in 14 positions. Transcript mapping revealed that the first ATG codon is just 20 nucleotides downstream of the mRNA 5' end and that the 3' end is just 23 nucleotides downstream of the nad9 stop codon. The expression of the nad9 gene in plant mitochondria was studied. Polyclonal antibodies prepared against a wheat NAD9 fusion protein specifically recognise the 30-kDa subunit of bovine mitochondrial complex I and a 27.5-kDa protein in the membrane fractions of wheat, maize and common bean mitochondria, whereas the same serum recognizes a 30-kDa protein in the mitochondria of pea, chickpea and lentil."

We tested the role of levan, a fructosyl polymer produced by strain CF43, in the aggregation of soil adhering to wheat roots. The P. polymyxa gene homologous to the Bacillus subtilis sacB gene encoding levansucrase was cloned and sequenced. The corresponding gene product synthesises high molecular weight levan. A P. polymyxa mutant strain, SB03, whose sacB gene is disrupted, was constructed using heterogramic conjugation. Effects of wheat inoculation with the wild type and the mutant strain were compared using two different cultivated silt loam soils in four independent pot experiments. Roots of wheat plantlets inoculated with CF43 or SB03 were colonized after 7-14 days at the same level, and root and shoot masses were not significantly different from those of the non-inoculated control plants. The ratio of root-adhering soil dry mass to root tissue dry mass was significantly higher for plants inoculated with strain CF43 than for those inoculated with mutant strain SB03: +30% in Orgeval soil and +100% in Dieulouard soil. Thus the levan produced by P. polymyxa is implicated in the aggregation of root-adhering soil on wheat."

"12631325","abstracttext","Compared to rice, wheat exhibits characteristic growth habits and contains complex genome constituents. To assess global changes in gene expression patterns in the wheat life cycle, we conducted large-scale analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in common wheat. Ten wheat tissues were used to construct cDNA libraries: crown and root from 14-day-old seedlings; spikelet from early and late flowering stages; spike at the booting stage, heading date and flowering date; pistil at the heading date; and seeds at 10 and 30 days post-anthesis. Several thousand colonies were randomly selected from each of these 10 cDNA libraries and sequenced from both 5' and 3' ends. Consequently, a total of 116 232 sequences were accumulated and classified into 25 971 contigs based on sequence homology. By computing abundantly expressed ESTs, correlated expression patterns of genes across the tissues were identified. Furthermore, relationships of gene expression profiles among the 10 wheat tissues were inferred from global gene expression patterns. Genes with similar functions were grouped with one another by clustering gene expression profiles. This technique might enable estimation of the functions of anonymous genes. Multidimensional analysis of EST data that is analogous to the microarray experiments may offer new approaches to functional genomics of plants."

"19252936","abstracttext","Lr19, one of the few widely effective genes conferring resistance to leaf rust in wheat, was transferred from the wild relative Thinopyrum ponticum to durum wheat. Since Lr19 confers a hypersensitive response to the pathogen, it was considered likely that the gene would be a member of the major nucleotide-binding site (NBS)-leucine-rich repeat (LRR) plant R gene family. NBS profiling, based on PCR amplification of conserved NBS motifs, was applied to durum wheat-Th. ponticum recombinant lines involving different segments of the alien 7AgL chromosome arm, carrying or lacking Lr19. Differential PCR products were isolated and sequenced. From one such sequence (AG15), tightly linked to Lr19, a 4,121-bp full-length cDNA was obtained. Its deduced 1,258 amino acid sequence has the characteristic NBS-LRR domains of plant R gene products and includes a coiled-coil (CC) region typical of monocots. The genomic DNA sequence showed the presence of two exons and a short intron upstream of the predicted stop codon. Homology searches revealed considerable identity of AG15 with the cloned wheat resistance gene Pm3a and a lower similarity with wheat Lr1, Lr21, and Lr10. Quantitative PCR on leaf-rust-infected and non-infected Lr19 carriers proved AG15 to be constitutively expressed, as is common for R genes."

"18944101","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Septoria tritici leaf blotch (STB), caused by the ascomycete Mycosphaerella graminicola (anamorph Septoria tritici), is an economically important disease of wheat. Breeding for resistance to STB is the most effective means to control this disease and can be facilitated through the use of molecular markers. However, molecular markers linked to most genes for resistance to STB are not yet available. This study was conducted to test for resistance in the parents of a standard wheat mapping population and to map any resistance genes identified. The population consisted of 130 F(10) recombinant-inbred lines (RILs) from a cross between the synthetic hexaploid wheat W7984 and cv. Opata 85. Genetic analysis indicated that a single major gene controls resistance to M. graminicola in this population. This putative resistance gene is now designated Stb8 and was mapped with respect to amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and microsatellite markers. An AFLP marker, EcoRI-ACG/MseI-CAG5, was linked in repulsion with the resistance gene at a distance of approximately 5.3 centimorgans (cM). Two flanking microsatellite markers, Xgwm146 and Xgwm577, were linked to the Stb8 gene on the long arm of wheat chromosome 7B at distances of 3.5 and 5.3 cM, respectively. The microsatellite markers identified in this study have potential for use in marker-assisted selection in breeding programs and for pyramiding of Stb8 with other genes for resistance to M. graminicola in wheat."

However, the function and evaluation of the haplotypes of the wheat CKX gene have yet to be illustrated. In this study, TaCKX6-D1, a wheat ortholog of rice OsCKX2, was cloned and its haplotype variants were determined to be significantly associated with the 1000-grain weight on the basis of linkage mapping, association analysis and gene expression analysis. Five TaCKX6-D1 haplotypes, designated a-e, were identified. An indel marker was developed to identify haplotype a, which was associated with higher grain weight. Haplotype a showed decreased expression relative to haplotype b in seeds at 8 d after pollination. Sequence variations among modern cultivars, landraces and wild species suggest a significant domestication signature at the TaCKX6-D1 locus in Chinese wheat germplasm. TaCKX6-D1 may serve as a useful gene for the breeding of high-yielding wheat. A strategy for allele mining and utilization of TaCKX6-D1 was proposed. Our study also sheds light on the mechanisms of grain development and domestication of wheat, as well as the functional divergence of orthologs in comparative genomics."

"22629358","abstracttext","Small GTP-binding proteins function as regulators of specific intercellular fundamental biological processes. In this study, a small GTP-binding protein Rab7 gene, designated as TaRab7, was identified and characterized from a cDNA library of wheat leaves infected with Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) the wheat stripe rust pathogen. The gene was predicted to encode a protein of 206 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 23.13 KDa and an isoeletric point (pI) of 5.13. Further analysis revealed the presence of a conserved signature that is characteristic of Rab7, and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that TaRab7 has the highest similarity to a small GTP binding protein gene (BdRab7-like) from Brachypodium distachyon. Quantitative real-time PCR assays revealed that the expression of TaRab7 was higher in the early stage of the incompatible interactions between wheat and Pst than in the compatible interaction, and the transcription level of TaRab7 was also highly induced by environmental stress stimuli. Furthermore, knocking down TaRab7 expression by virus induced gene silencing enhanced the susceptibility of wheat cv. Suwon 11 to an avirulent race CYR23. These results imply that TaRab7 plays an important role in the early stage of wheat-stripe rust fungus interaction and in stress tolerance."

"19364806","abstracttext","The wheat leaf-rust resistance gene Lr21 was first identified in an Iranian accession of goatgrass, Aegilops tauschii Coss., the D-genome donor of hexaploid bread wheat, and was introgressed into modern wheat cultivars by breeding. To elucidate the origin of the gene, we analyzed sequences of Lr21 and lr21 alleles from 24 wheat cultivars and 25 accessions of Ae. tauschii collected along the Caspian Sea in Iran and Azerbaijan. Three basic nonfunctional lr21 haplotypes, H1, H2, and H3, were identified. Lr21 was found to be a chimera of H1 and H2, which were found only in wheat. We attempted to reconstitute a functional Lr21 allele by crossing the cultivars Fielder (H1) and Wichita (H2). Rust inoculation of 5876 F(2) progeny revealed a single resistant plant that proved to carry the H1H2 haplotype, a result attributed to intragenic recombination. These findings reflect how plants balance the penalty and the necessity of a resistance gene and suggest that plants can reuse ""dead"" alleles to generate new disease-resistance specificity, leading to a ""death-recycle"" model of plant-resistance gene evolution at simple loci. We suggest that selection pressure in crop-weed complexes contributes to this process."

The results indicated that Y12 possessed one dominant resistance gene to wheat stripe rust, designated YrpstY1 provisionally. A total of 388 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to map the resistance gene in Y12 using bulked segregant analysis. A linkage map, including nine SSR loci on chromosome 7H and YrpstY1, was constructed using the BC(1) population, indicating that the resistance gene YrpstY1 is located on chromosome 7H.

"23415326","abstracttext","Drought and salinity are the primary factors limiting wheat production worldwide. It has been shown that a rice stress-responsive transcription factor encoded by the rice NAC1 gene (SNAC1) plays an important role in drought stress tolerance. Therefore, we introduced the SNAC1 gene under the control of a maize ubiquitin promoter into an elite Chinese wheat variety Yangmai12. Plants expressing SNAC1 displayed significantly enhanced tolerance to drought and salinity in multiple generations, and contained higher levels of water and chlorophyll in their leaves, as compared to wild type. In addition, the fresh and dry weights of the roots of these plants were also increased, and the plants had increased sensitivities to abscisic acid (ABA), which inhibited root and shoot growth. Furthermore, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions revealed that the expressions of genes involved in abiotic stress/ABA signaling, such as wheat 1-phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate-5-kinase, sucrose phosphate synthase, type 2C protein phosphatases and regulatory components of ABA receptor, were effectively regulated by the alien SNAC1 gene. These results indicated high and functional expression of the rice SNAC1 gene in wheat. And our study provided a promising approach to improve the tolerances of wheat cultivars to drought and salinity through genetic engineering."

"23641182","abstracttext","Low temperature induces expression of Cor (cold-responsive)/Lea (late embryogenesis-abundant) gene family members through C-repeat binding factor (CBF) transcription factors in common wheat. However, the relationship between the genetic loci controlling cold-responsive gene expression and freezing tolerance is unclear. In expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis, accumulated transcripts of Cor/Lea and CBF genes were quantified in recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between two common wheat cultivars with different levels of freezing tolerance. Four eQTLs controlling five cold-responsive genes were found, and the major eQTL with the greatest effect was located on the long arm of chromosome 5A. At least the 1D and 5A eQTLs played important roles in development of freezing tolerance in common wheat. The chromosomal location of the 5A eQTL, controlling four cold-responsive genes, coincided with a region homoeologous to a frost-tolerance locus (Fr-A (m) 2) reported as a CBF cluster region in einkorn wheat. The 5A eQTL plays a significant role through Cor/Lea gene expression in cold acclimation of wheat. In addition, our results suggest that one or more CBF copies at the Fr-2 region positively regulate other copies, which might amplify the positive effects of the CBF cluster on downstream Cor/Lea gene activation."

"23864359","abstracttext","microRNAs (miRNAs) are novel and significant regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, and they are essential for normal growth and development and adaptation to stress conditions. As miRNAs are a kind of RNAs that do not code proteins, they play roles by repressing gene translation or degrading the corresponding target mRNAs. Plantacyanin-like (basic blue) proteins have been predicted and verified as the target gene of miR408 in wheat and Arabidopsis, respectively. Besides some biochemical characteristics, their detailed biological function remains unknown. In this study, the target gene of a wheat miRNA (tae-miR408), designated TaCLP1, was identified using degradome sequencing and co-transformation technology in tobacco leaves. We isolated the full-length cDNA clone, and defined its product as a chemocyanin-like protein, a kind of plantacyanin. Transcript accumulation of TaCLP1 and tae-miR408 showed contrasting divergent expression patterns in wheat response to Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) and high copper ion stress. Overexpression of TaCLP1 in yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) significantly increased cell growth under high salinity and Cu²⁺ stresses. Silencing of individual cDNA clones in wheat challenged with Pst indicated that TaCLP1 positively regulates resistance to stripe rust. The results indicate that the target of tae-miR408, TaCLP1, play an important role in regulating resistance of host plants to abiotic stresses and stripe rust, and such interactions can be a valuable resource for investigating stress tolerance in wheat."

"24080395","abstracttext","ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) catalyzes the first committed step of starch synthesis. AGPase is a heterotetramer composed of two large subunits and two small subunits, has cytosolic and plastidial isoforms, and is detected mainly in the cytosol of endosperm in cereal crops. To investigate the effects of AGPase cytosolic large subunit gene (LSU I) on starch biosynthesis in higher plant, in this study, a TaLSU I gene from wheat was overexpressed under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter in a wheat cultivar (Yumai 34). PCR, Southern blot, and real-time RT-PCR analyses indicated that the transgene was integrated into the genome of transgenic plants and was overexpressed in their progeny. The overexpression of the TaLSU I gene remarkably enhanced AGPase activity, endosperm starch weight, grain number per spike, and single grain weight. Therefore, we conclude that overexpression of the TaLSU I gene enhances the starch biosynthesis in endosperm of wheat grains, having potential applications in wheat breeding to develop a high-yield wheat cultivar with high starch weight and kernel weight."

"28724077","abstracttext","Bread wheat ( L.) is one of the most important crops worldwide. Although a reference genome sequence would represent a valuable resource for wheat improvement through genomics-assisted breeding and gene cloning, its generation has long been hampered by its allohexaploidy, high repeat content, and large size. As a part of a project coordinated by the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC), a physical map of the short arm of wheat chromosome 3D (3DS) was prepared to facilitate reference genome assembly and positional gene cloning. It comprises 869 contigs with a cumulative length of 274.5 Mbp and represents 85.5% of the estimated chromosome arm size. Eighty-six Mbp of survey sequences from chromosome arm 3DS were assigned in silico to physical map contigs via next-generation sequencing of bacterial artificial chromosome pools, thus providing a high-density framework for physical map ordering along the chromosome arm. About 60% of the physical map was anchored in this single experiment. Finally, 1393 high-confidence genes were anchored to the physical map. Comparisons of gene space of the chromosome arm 3DS with genomes of closely related species [ (L.) P.Beauv., rice ( L.), and sorghum [ (L.) Moench] and homeologous wheat chromosomes provided information about gene movement on the chromosome arm."

"30862358","abstracttext","Drought is the most serious meteorological disaster affecting wheat production. Members of the R2R3-MYB gene subfamily play a crucial role in the regulation of the wheat drought stress response. In this study, the function of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced expression of the wheat R2R3-MYB gene TaSIM in response to drought stress was characterized. β-Glucuronidase (GUS) histochemical staining revealed that the TaSIM promoter can drive the expression of the GUS gene in the flowers, roots, stems and rosette leaves. Moreover, TaSIM was expressed in the stamens, pistils, roots, stems and leaves of wheat. The TaSIM promoter contains a known stress-responsive cis-acting element and is inducible by stress, PEG and abscisic acid (ABA). Under drought stress, compared with wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis, transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing TaSIM presented significantly lower leaf water loss rates and increased survival. Moreover, the content of soluble sugars and proline and the expression of stress-related genes (RD29A and RD22) in transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing TaSIM were higher than those in WT Arabidopsis under drought stress. Our results indicate that TaSIM plays a positive role in the drought stress response and can be used as a candidate gene for the genetic engineering of wheat drought resistance."

"30262705","abstracttext","Wheat stripe (yellow) rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis West. f. sp. tritici ( Pst ), is one of the most destructive diseases in many wheat-growing countries, especially in China, the largest stripe rust epidemic area in the world. Growing the resistant cultivars is an effective, economic and environmentally friendly way to control this disease. Wheat cultivar Zhengmai 7698 has shown a high-level resistance to wheat stripe rust. To elucidate its genetic characteristics and location of the resistance gene, Zhengmai 7698 was crossed with susceptible variety Taichung 29 to produce F 1 , F 2 and BC 1 progeny generations. The genetic analysis showed that the stripe rust resistance in Zhengmai 7698 to Pst predominant race CYR32 was controlled by a single-dominant gene, named YrZM . Bulked segregant analysis and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to map the gene. Four SSR markers, Xbarc198 , Xwmc179 , Xwmc786 and Xwmc398 on chromosome 6BL were polymorphic between the parents and resistance, and susceptible bulks. A linkage genetic map was constructed using 212 F 2 plants in the sequential order of Xwmc398 , Xwmc179 , YrZM , Xbarc198 , Xwmc786 . As this gene is effective against predominant race CYR32, it is useful in combination with other resistance genes for developing new wheat cultivars with resistance to stripe rust."

"30678154","abstracttext","Salicylic acid (SA) is a key defense hormone associated with wheat resistance against Fusarium head blight, which is a severe disease mainly caused by Fusarium graminearum . Although F. graminearum can metabolize SA, it remains unclear how this metabolic activity affects the wheat⁻ F. graminearum interaction. In this study, we identified a salicylate hydroxylase gene ( FG05_08116 ; FgNahG ) in F. graminearum . This gene encodes a protein that catalyzes the conversion of SA to catechol. Additionally, FgNahG was widely distributed within hyphae. Disrupting the FgNahG gene (Δ FgNahG ) led to enhanced sensitivity to SA, increased accumulation of SA in wheat spikes during the early infection stage and inhibited development of head blight symptoms. However, FgNahG did not affect mycotoxin production. Re-introducing a functional FgNahG gene into the Δ FgNahG mutant recovered the wild-type phenotype. Moreover, the expression of FgNahG in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana decreased the SA concentration and the resistance of leaves to F. graminearum . These results indicate that the endogenous SA in wheat influences the resistance against F. graminearum . Furthermore, the capacity to metabolize SA is an important factor affecting the ability of F. graminearum to infect wheat plants."

"30337587","abstracttext","Wheat spike development is a coordinated process of cell proliferation and differentiation with distinctive phases and architecture changes. However, the dynamic alteration of gene expression in this process remains enigmatic. Here, we characterized and dissected bread wheat spike into six developmental stages, and used genome-wide gene expression profiling, to investigate the underlying regulatory mechanisms. High gene expression correlations between any two given stages indicated that wheat early spike development is controlled by a small subset of genes. Throughout, auxin signaling increased, while cytokinin signaling decreased. Besides, many genes associated with stress responses highly expressed during the double ridge stage. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), were identified 375 transcription factor (TF) genes, of which some homologs in rice or Arabidopsis are proposed to function in meristem maintenance, flowering time, meristem initiation or transition, floral organ development or response to stress. Gene expression profiling demonstrated that these genes had either similar or distinct expression pattern in wheat. Several genes regulating spike development were expressed in the early spike, of which Earliness per se 3 (Eps-3) was found might function in the initiation of spikelet meristem. Our study helps uncover important genes associated with apical meristem morphology and development in wheat."

"32448445","abstracttext","Leaf rust (also called brown rust) in wheat, caused by fungal pathogen Puccinia triticina Erikss. (Pt) is one of the major constraints in wheat production worldwide. Pt is widespread with diverse population structure and undergoes rapid evolution to produce new virulent races against resistant cultivars that are regularly developed to provide resistance against the prevailing races of the pathogen. Occasionally, the disease may also take the shape of an epidemic in some wheat-growing areas causing major economic losses. In the recent past, substantial progress has been made in characterizing the sources of leaf rust resistance including non-host resistance (NHR). Progress has also been made in elucidating the population biology of Pt and the mechanisms of wheat-Pt interaction. So far, ∼80 leaf rust resistance genes (Lr genes) have been identified and characterized; some of them have also been used for the development of resistant wheat cultivars. It has also been shown that a gene-for-gene relationship exists between individual wheat Lr genes and the corresponding Pt Avr genes so that no Lr gene can provide resistance unless the prevailing race of the pathogen carries the corresponding Avr gene. Several Lr genes have also been cloned and their products characterized, although no Avr gene corresponding a specific Lr gene has so far been identified. However, several candidate effectors for Pt have been identified and functionally characterized using genome-wide analyses, transcriptomics, RNA sequencing, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), transient expression and other approaches. This review summarizes available information on different aspects of the pathogen Pt, genetics/genomics of leaf rust resistance in wheat including cloning and characterization of Lr genes and epigenetic regulation of disease resistance."

Similar gene structures and conserved protein motifs of TaASRs in wheat were identified in the same groups. ASR genes contained various TF binding cites associated with the stress responses in the promoter region. Gene expression was generally associated with the expected group-specific expression pattern in five tissues, including grain, leaf, root, spike and stem, indicating the broad conservation of ASR genes function during wheat evolution.

"19255779","abstracttext","Homeotic transformation of stamens into pistil-like structures, called pistillody, has been reported in some alloplasmic common wheat lines with Aegilops crassa cytoplasm. An alloplasmic line of Chinese Spring ditelosomic 7BS (CSdt7BS) with Ae. crassa cytoplasm lacking the long arm of the chromosome 7B shows pistillody, and the pistils and transformed stamens are sterile due to abnormal ovule development. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of the ovule abnormality, we compared the expression profiles of floral organs between euplasmic and alloplasmic CSdt7BS lines. Two differential display methods of mRNA profiling demonstrated that Ae. crassa cytoplasm largely affects nuclear gene expression profiles of common wheat. Of the differentially expressed genes, a wheat AINTEGUMENTA (ANT) homolog, WANT-1, was preferentially expressed in pistils but not in stamens, and accumulation of the transcript was limited to ovule primordia at the floral organ development stage. In alloplasmic wheat, WANT-1 expression was patchy and weak at the ovule-development stages. On the other hand, no significant difference in gene expression patterns of wheat AGAMOUS (AG) homologs (WAG-1 and WAG-2) was observed between fertile and sterile pistils. These results indicated that alteration of gene expression after initiation of ovule primordia results in abnormal ovule development, and that the aberrant ovule formation is at least partly associated with the weak expression of WANT-1 around ovule primordia in alloplasmic wheat with Ae. crassa cytoplasm."

"23346876","abstracttext","Despite the international significance of wheat, its large and complex genome hinders genome sequencing efforts. To assess the impact of selection on this genome, we have assembled genomic regions representing genes for chromosomes 7A, 7B and 7D. We demonstrate that the dispersion of wheat to new environments has shaped the modern wheat genome. Most genes are conserved between the three homoeologous chromosomes. We found differential gene loss that supports current theories on the evolution of wheat, with greater loss observed in the A and B genomes compared with the D. Analysis of intervarietal polymorphisms identified fewer polymorphisms in the D genome, supporting the hypothesis of early gene flow between the tetraploid and hexaploid. The enrichment for genes on the D genome that confer environmental adaptation may be associated with dispersion following wheat domestication. Our results demonstrate the value of applying next-generation sequencing technologies to assemble gene-rich regions of complex genomes and investigate polyploid genome evolution. We anticipate the genome-wide application of this reduced-complexity syntenic assembly approach will accelerate crop improvement efforts not only in wheat, but also in other polyploid crops of significance."

In this review we primarily focus on the tools and techniques available for accessing gene functions which lead to clear phenotypes in wheat. We provide a view of the development of wheat transformation techniques from a historical perspective, and summarize how techniques have been adapted to obtain gain-of-function phenotypes by gene overexpression, loss-of-function phenotypes by expressing antisense RNAs (RNA interference or RNAi), and most recently the manipulation of gene structure and expression using site-specific nucleases, such as CRISPR/Cas9, for genome editing.

"32528079","abstracttext","Wheat has low levels of the micronutrients iron and zinc in the grain, which contributes to 2 billion people suffering from micronutrient deficiency globally. While wheat flour is commonly fortified during processing, an attractive and more sustainable solution is biofortification, which could improve micronutrient content in the human diet, without the sustainability issues and costs associated with conventional fortification. Although many studies have used quantitative trait loci mapping and genome-wide association to identify genetic loci to improve micronutrient contents, recent developments in genomics offer an opportunity to accelerate marker discovery and use gene-focussed approaches to engineer improved micronutrient content in wheat. The recent publication of a high-quality wheat genome sequence, alongside gene expression atlases, variation datasets and sequenced mutant populations, provides a foundation to identify genetic loci and genes controlling micronutrient content in wheat. We discuss how novel genomic resources can identify candidate genes for biofortification, integrating knowledge from other cereal crops, and how these genes can be tested using gene editing, transgenic and TILLING approaches. Finally, we highlight key challenges remaining to develop wheat cultivars with high levels of iron and zinc."

"31790345","abstracttext","Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a mycotoxin virulence factor that promotes growth of the Fusarium graminearum fungus in wheat floral tissues. To further our understanding of the effects of DON exposure on plant cell function, we characterized DON-induced transcriptional changes in wheat spikelets. Four hundred wheat genes were differentially expressed during infection with wild-type F. graminearum as compared with a Δtri5 mutant strain that is unable to produce DON. Most of these genes were more induced by the DON-producing strain and included genes involved in secondary metabolism, signaling, transport, and stress responses. DON induction was confirmed for a subset of the genes, including TaNFXL1 , by treating tissues with DON directly. Previous work indicates that the NFXL1 ortholog represses trichothecene-induced defense responses and bacterial resistance in Arabidopsis , but the role of the NFXL family has not been studied in wheat. We observed greater DON-induced TaNFXL1 gene expression in a susceptible wheat genotype relative to the F. graminearum -resistant genotype Wuhan 1. Functional testing using both virus-induced gene silencing and CRISPR-mediated genome editing indicated that TaNFXL1 represses F. graminearum resistance. Together, this suggests that targeting the TaNFXL1 gene may help to develop disease resistance in cultivated wheat."

This study addressed introgression between wheat and natural populations of its wild relatives (Aegilops species). The sampling included 472 individuals, collected from 32 Mediterranean populations of three widespread Aegilops species (Aegilops geniculata, Ae. neglecta and Ae. triuncialis) and compared wheat field borders to areas isolated from agriculture. Individuals were characterized with amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting, analysed through two computational approaches (i.e. Bayesian estimations of admixture and fuzzy clustering), and sequences marking wheat-specific insertions of transposable elements. With this combined approach, we detected substantial gene flow between wheat and Aegilops species. Specifically, Ae. neglecta and Ae. triuncialis showed significantly more admixed individuals close to wheat fields than in locations isolated from agriculture. In contrast, little evidence of gene flow was found in Ae. geniculata. Our results indicated that reproductive barriers have been regularly bypassed during the long history of sympatry between wheat and Aegilops."

"2150349","abstracttext","The nucleotide sequence of the wheat chloroplast atp I gene encoding CF0 subunit IV of ATP synthase has been determined. The gene encodes a polypeptide of 247 amino acid residues with high sequence similarity to subunit IV from other plant chloroplasts and from cyanobacteria.

The atp I gene is co-transcribed with the atp H, atp F and atp A genes for other subunits of ATP synthase in wheat. A gene-fusion of most of the atp I coding region with cro'-lacI'-lacZ' has been constructed in pEX2 and the fusion-protein has been used to raise antibodies in rabbits. The antibodies react with a polypeptide of 17 kDa in wheat thylakoid membranes indicating that the wheat atp I gene is expressed at the protein level. A model for the organisation of the polypeptide in the thylakoid membrane with four membrane-spanning segments is proposed."

"9000383","abstracttext","A plant mitochondrial gene with sequence similarity to ccl1, a bacterial gene involved in cytochrome c biogenesis, occurs as a single open reading frame in wheat, Oenothera, carrot and Marchantia mtDNAs. In Brassica napus ""Polima"" or Brassica campestris mtDNA, however, this open reading frame is split into two segments that are located 60 kb apart on the master-circle form of the genome. Although transcripts of the split ORF are edited in a manner similar to that of a functional gene, transcripts that span both portions of the ORF are not evident in gel-blot hybridization experiments. Low-abundance transcripts that span both portions of the split ORF can be detected by RT-PCR, but these contain an additional 54-bp sequence, inserted between the two segments, that is unrelated to the corresponding sequences of other plants. Since this additional sequence introduces an in-frame stop codon, no transcripts have been found that could be translated to yield a protein product of a size similar to that present in other plant species. An antiserum directed against the product of the corresponding wheat gene detects polypeptides of similar size in wheat and Brassica mitochondria. This antiserum, however, immunoprecipitates a labelled polypeptide from the products of wheat, but not Brassica, in organello protein synthesis. Gel-blot analysis of total Brassica DNA indicates that sequences capable of hybridizing with the ORF are present in the nuclear genome. We suggest that the functional form of the Brassica gene may reside in the nucleus."

"9700067","abstracttext","In plants, several types of receptor-like kinases (RLK) have been isolated and characterized based on the sequence of their extracellular domains. Some of these RLKs have been demonstrated to be involved in plant development or in the reaction to environmental signals. Here, we describe a RLK gene family in wheat (wlrk, wheat leaf rust kinase) with a new type of extracellular domain. A member of this new gene family has previously been shown to cosegregate with the leaf rust resistance gene Lr10. The diversity of the wlrk gene family was studied by cloning the extracellular domain of different members of the family. Sequence comparisons demonstrated that the extracellular domain consists of three very conserved regions interrupted by three variable regions. Linkage analysis indicated that the wlrk genes are specifically located on chromosome group 1 in wheat and on the corresponding chromosomes of other members of the Triticeae family. The wlrk genes are constitutively expressed in the aerial parts of the plant whereas no expression was detected in roots. Protein immunoblots demonstrated that the WLRK protein coded by the Lrk10 gene is an intrinsic plasma membrane protein. This is consistent with the hypothesis that WLRK proteins are receptor protein kinases localized to the cell surface. In addition, we present preliminary evidence that other disease resistance loci in wheat contain genes which are related to wlrk."

"15514040","abstracttext","The complex hexaploid wheat genome offers many challenges for genomics research. Expressed sequence tags facilitate the analysis of gene-coding regions and provide a rich source of molecular markers for mapping and comparison with model organisms. The objectives of this study were to construct a high-density EST chromosome bin map of wheat homoeologous group 2 chromosomes to determine the distribution of ESTs, construct a consensus map of group 2 ESTs, investigate synteny, examine patterns of duplication, and assess the colinearity with rice of ESTs assigned to the group 2 consensus bin map. A total of 2600 loci generated from 1110 ESTs were mapped to group 2 chromosomes by Southern hybridization onto wheat aneuploid chromosome and deletion stocks. A consensus map was constructed of 552 ESTs mapping to more than one group 2 chromosome. Regions of high gene density in distal bins and low gene density in proximal bins were found. Two interstitial gene-rich islands flanked by relatively gene-poor regions on both the short and long arms and having good synteny with rice were discovered. The map locations of two ESTs indicated the possible presence of a small pericentric inversion on chromosome 2B. Wheat chromosome group 2 was shown to share syntenous blocks with rice chromosomes 4 and 7."

"12175064","abstracttext","Addition of the long arm of barley chromosome 1H (1HL) to wheat causes severe meiotic abnormalities and complete sterility of the plants. To map the barley gene responsible for the 1H-induced sterility of wheat, a series of addition lines of translocated 1H chromosomes were developed from the crosses between the wheat 'Shinchunaga' and five reciprocal translocation lines derived from the barley line St.13559. Examination of the seed fertility of the addition lines revealed that the sterility gene is located in the interstitial 25% region of the 1HL arm. The genetic location of the sterility gene was also estimated by physically mapping sequence-tagged site (STS) markers and simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers with known map locations. The sterility gene is designated Shw (sterility in hybrids with wheat). Comparison of the present physical map of 1HL with two previously published genetic maps revealed a paucity of markers in the proximal 30% region and non-random distribution of SSR markers. Two inconsistencies in marker order were found between the present physical map and the consensus genetic map of group 1 chromosomes of Triticeae. On the basis of the effects on meiosis and chromosomal location, the relationship of the present sterility gene with other fertility-related genes of Triticeae is discussed."

"12647060","abstracttext","Powdery mildew, caused by Erysiphe graminis DM f. sp. tritici (Em. Marchal), is one of the most important diseases of common wheat world-wide. Chinese wheat variety 'Fuzhuang 30' carries the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm5e and has proven to be a valuable resistance source of powdery mildew for wheat breeding. Microsatellite markers were employed to identify the gene Pm5e in a F(2) progeny from the cross 'Nongda 15' (susceptible) x 'Fuzhuang 30' (resistant). The gene Pm5e was mapped in the distal region of chromosome 7BL. Seven microsatellite markers were found to be linked to the gene Pm5e, of which two codominant markers Xgwm783 and Xgwm1267 were relatively close to Pm5e with a linkage distance of 11.0 cM and 6.6 cM, respectively. It is possible to use the 136-bp allele of Xgwm1267 in 'Fuzhuang 30' for marker-assisted selection during the wheat resistance breeding process for facilitation of gene pyramiding. The mapping information in the present study provides a starting point for fine mapping of the Pm5 locus and map-based cloning to clarify the molecular structure and function of the different alleles at the Pm5 locus. A microsatellite linkage map of chromosome 7B was constructed with 20 microsatellite loci, nine on the short arm and 11 on the long arm. This information will be very useful for further mapping of agronomically important genes of interest on chromosome 7B."

"16311724","abstracttext","The broad-spectrum stem rust resistance gene Sr2 has provided protection in wheat against Puccinia graminis Pers. f. sp. tritici for over 80 years. The Sr2 gene and an associated dark pigmentation trait, pseudo-black chaff (PBC), have previously been localized to the short arm of chromosome 3B. In a first step towards the positional-based cloning of Sr2, we constructed a high-resolution map of this region. The wheat EST (wEST) deletion bin mapping project provided tightly linked cDNA markers. The rice genome sequence was used to infer the putative gene order for orthologous wheat genes and provide additional markers once the syntenic interval in rice was identified. We used this approach to map six wESTs that were collinear with the physical order of the corresponding genes on rice chromosome 1 suggesting there are no major re-arrangements between wheat and rice in this region. We were unable to separate by recombination the tightly linked morphological trait, PBC from the stem rust resistance gene suggesting that either a single gene or two tightly linked genes control both traits."

"18974935","abstracttext","Maize rough sheath2 (RS2) and Arabidopsis ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1) both encode a Myb transcription factor and repress Knotted1-type homeobox (KNOX) genes. The RS2/AS1-KNOX relationship is functionally conserved between maize and Arabidopsis. Here, we cloned wheat orthologs of RS2/AS1 and of a maize rough sheath1 (rs1) KNOX gene and named them WRS2 and WRS1, respectively. WRS1 mRNA was detected at leaf insertion points of the vegetative shoot meristem but was missing in differentiating floral organs. Conversely, WRS2 transcripts accumulated in initiating and developing floral organs. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing WRS1 showed morphological alterations typically observed due to expression of other KNOX genes. WRS2 with a deletion of the Myb domain could interact with NtPHAN to form a heterodimer, and expression of the truncated WRS2 gene conferred a dominant-negative phenotype similar to that expected and induced ectopic expression of an endogenous KNOX gene. Moreover, WRS2 expression alleviated morphological alterations in tobacco plants expressing the wheat KNOX gene. Therefore, the WRS2 gene product represses KNOX expression. These results indicate that the WRS2-KNOX relationship plays a fundamentally important role in lateral organ initiation and differentiation of meristems in wheat development. The antagonistic relationship between WRS2 and KNOX around meristematic tissues has been functionally conserved during wheat evolution."

"20145295","abstracttext","Extensive genetic variations of low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) and their coding genes were found in the wild diploid A- and D-genome donors of common wheat. In this study, we reported the isolation and characterization of 8 novel LMW-GS genes from Ae.longissima Schweinf. & Muschl., a species of the section Sitopsis of the genus Aegilops, which is closely related to the B genome of common wheat. Based on the N-terminal domain sequences, the 8 genes were divided into 3 groups. A consensus alignment of the extremely conserved domains with known gene groups and the subsequent cluster analysis showed that 2 out of the 3 groups of LMW-GS genes were closely related to those from the B genome, and the remaining was related to those from A and D genomes of wheat and Ae. tauschii. Using 3 sets of gene-group-specific primers, PCRs in diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid wheats and Ae. tauschii failed to obtain the expected products, indicating that the 3 groups of LMW-GS genes obtained in this study were new members of LMW-GS multi-gene families. These results suggested that the Sitopsis species of the genus Aegilops with novel gene variations could be used as valuable gene resources of LMW-GS. The 3 sets of group-specific primers could be utilized as molecular markers to investigate the introgression of novel alien LMW-GS genes from Ae. longissima into wheat."

"19483775","abstracttext","Gene distribution is highly uneven in the large genomes of barley and wheat; however, location, order, and gene density of gene-containing regions are very similar between the two genomes. Flanking sequences from 35 unique, single-copy, barley Ds insertion events were physically mapped using wheat nullisomic-tetrasomic, ditelosomic, and deletion lines. Of the 35 sequences, 23 (66%) detected 34 loci mapping on all 7 homoeologous wheat groups. Seven sequences were not mapped owing to lack of polymorphism and the remaining 5 (14%) were barley-specific. All 34 loci physically mapped to the previously identified gene-rich regions (GRRs) of wheat, making the contained genes candidates for targeted mutagenesis by remobilization. Transpositions occurred preferentially into GRRs with higher recombination rates. The GRRs containing 17 of the 23 Ds insertions accounted for 60%-89% of the respective arm's recombination. The remaining 6 (17%) insertions mapped to GRRs with <15% of the arm's recombination. Overall, kb/cM estimates for the Ds-containing GRRs were twofold higher than those for regions without insertions. These results suggest that all genes may be targeted by transposon-based gene cloning, although the transposition frequency for genes present in recombination-poor regions is significantly less than that present in highly recombinogenic regions."

"20720298","abstracttext","The winter wheat cultivar Red Chief has been identified as the wheat cultivar most resistant to Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr). This study was undertaken to determine the inheritance, chromosomal location and molecular mapping of a tan spot resistance gene in Red Chief. χ² analysis of the F2 segregation data of the hybrids between 21 monosomic lines of the susceptible wheat cultivar Chinese Spring and the resistant cultivar Red Chief revealed that tan spot resistance in cv. Red Chief is controlled by a single recessive gene located on chromosome 3A. Linkage analysis using SSR markers in the Red Chief/Chinese Spring F2 population showed that the tsr4 gene is clustered in the region around Xgwm2a, on the short arm of chromosome 3A. This marker has also been identified as the closest marker to the tsr3 locus on chromosome 3D in synthetic wheat lines. Validation analysis of this marker for the tsr3 and tsr4 genes using 28 resistant and 6 susceptible genotypes indicated that the 120 bp allele (the tsr3 gene) specific fragment was observed in 11 resistant genotypes, including the three synthetic lines XX41, XX45 and XX110, while the 130 bp allele was amplified only in cv. Red Chief and Dashen. Xgwm2a can be used to trace the presence of the target gene in successive backcross generations and pyramiding of the tsr3 & tsr4 genes into a commonly grown and adaptable cultivar."

"27614049","abstracttext","Targeted mutagenesis using programmable DNA endonucleases has broad applications for studying gene function in planta and developing approaches to improve crop yields. Recently, a genetic method that eliminates the need to emasculate the female inbred during hybrid seed production, referred to as Seed Production Technology, has been described. The foundation of this genetic system relied on classical methods to identify genes critical to anther and pollen development. One of these genes is a P450 gene which is expressed in the tapetum of anthers. Homozygous recessive mutants in this gene render maize and rice plants male sterile. While this P450 in maize corresponds to the male fertility gene Ms26, male fertility mutants have not been isolated in other monocots such as sorghum and wheat. In this report, a custom designed homing endonuclease, Ems26+, was used to generate in planta mutations in the rice, sorghum and wheat orthologs of maize Ms26. Similar to maize, homozygous mutations in this P450 gene in rice and sorghum prevent pollen formation resulting in male sterile plants and fertility was restored in sorghum using a transformed copy of maize Ms26. In contrast, allohexaploid wheat plants that carry similar homozygous nuclear mutations in only one, but not all three, of their single genomes were male fertile. Targeted mutagenesis and subsequent characterization of male fertility genes in sorghum and wheat is an important step for capturing heterosis and improving crop yields through hybrid seed."

"28848598","abstracttext","Mutated genetic resources play an important role in gene/allele characterization. Currently, there are few hexaploid winter wheat mutated resources available. Here, we developed a hexaploid winter wheat resource by inducing mutations via EMS treatment by the single seed descent method. A broad mutation spectrum with high mutation frequency (∼19%) on phenotypic variations was identified. These mutations included spike, leaf and seed morphology, plant architecture, and heading date variations. To evaluate the efficiency of the resource for reverse genetic analysis, allelic variations in the TaAGP.L-B1 gene, encoding the AGPase large subunit, were screened by the TILLING approach. Four missense mutations were identified and one allele in line E3-1-3, resulted in an amino acid change predicated to have severe effects on gene function. The other three mutations were predicted to have no effect. Results of gene expression patterns and grain starch content demonstrated that the novel allele in E3-1-3 altered the function of TaAGP.L-B1 . Our results indicated that this mutated genetic wheat resource contained broad spectrum phenotypic and genotypic variations, that may be useful for wheat improvement, gene discovery, and functional genomics."

"30238255","abstracttext_key message","A new and dominant R gene Stb19 is identified from a soft wheat cultivar 'Lorikeet' and was mapped on the distal region of chromosome 1DS. Two tightly linked KASP markers were also discovered and validated for molecular-assisted breeding programs. A new R gene, designated as Stb19, provides resistance to Zymoseptoria tritici in wheat. This new dominant gene resides on the short arm of chromosome 1D, exhibiting complete resistance to three Z. tritici isolates, WAI332, WAI251, and WAI161, at the seedling stage. A genetic linkage map, based on an F 2:3 population of 'Lorikeet' and 'Summit,' found the Stb19 gene at a 9.3 cM region on 1DS, closely linked with two Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR markers, snp_4909967 and snp_1218021. Further, the two markers were tested and validated in another F 2:3 population and 266 different wheat accessions, which gave over 95% accuracy of resistance/susceptibility prediction. Combined with the physical location of the identified SNPs and the previous evidence of gene order on chromosome 1DS (centromere-Sr45-Sr33-Lr21-telomere), Stb19 is proposed to be located between Sr33 and Lr21. Thus, the newly discovered Stb19 along with the KASP markers represents an increase in genetic resources available for wheat breeding resistance to Z. tritici."

This filamentous fungus is able to produce hydrolytic enzymes, such as xylanases, that cause cell wall degradation, permitting host colonization. This study investigated the role of the F. graminearum XylA (FGSG_10999) gene during infection, using a knockout mutant in strain CS3005. Assays were carried out on common wheat, durum wheat and barley to compare virulence of a XylA knockout to that of wild type strain. These assays were conducted on wheat and barley seedling roots, seedling stem bases and heads. Furthermore, additional in vitro experiments were conducted to investigate the role of XylA gene in the utilisation of D-xylose, the main component of cereals cell wall. In planta assays showed the importance of XylA gene for F. graminearum virulence towards its main hosts. A positive correlation between symptom incidence and fungal biomass development was also observed for both the wild type and the knockout strains. Finally, gene expression studies performed in a liquid medium enriched with D-xylose, a known xylanase inducer in other fungi, showed that the absence of the gene in the FGSG_10999 locus was not compensated by two other F. graminearum xylanase encoding genes analysed (loci FGSG_06445 and FGSG_11478)."

However, there is no documented research about this key cyclase gene's function and relationship with β-carotene content in wheat. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to clone TaLCYB and characterize its function and relationship with β-carotene biosynthesis in wheat grains. We also aimed to obtain more information about the endogenous carotenoid biosynthetic pathway and thus provide experimental support for carotenoid metabolic engineering in wheat."
"25943989","abstracttext_results","In the present study, a lycopene β-cyclase gene, designated TaLCYB, was cloned from the hexaploid wheat cultivar Chinese Spring. The cyclization activity of the encoded protein was demonstrated by heterologous complementation analysis. The TaLCYB gene was expressed differentially in different tissues of wheat. Although TaLCYB had a higher expression level in the later stages of grain development, the β-carotene content still showed a decreasing tendency. The expression of TaLCYB in leaves was dramatically induced by strong light and the β-carotene content variation corresponded with changes of TaLCYB expression. A post-transcriptional gene silencing strategy was used to down-regulate the expression of TaLCYB in transgenic wheat, resulting in a decrease in the content of β-carotene and lutein, accompanied by the accumulation of lycopene to partly compensate for the total carotenoid content. In addition, changes in TaLCYB expression also affected the expression of several endogenous carotenogenic genes to varying degrees."
"25943989","abstracttext_conclusion","Our results suggest that TaLCYB is a genuine lycopene cyclase gene and plays a crucial role in β-carotene biosynthesis in wheat. Our attempt to silence it not only contributes to elucidating the mechanism of carotenoid accumulation in wheat but may also help in breeding wheat varieties with high provitamin A content through RNA interference (RNAi) to block specific carotenogenic genes in the wheat endosperm."

It contains four introns possessing group II features and their positions differ from those in both the liverwort mitochondrial nad7 pseudogene and the nuclear gene encoding the homologous 49 kDa subunit of complex I in Neurospora. The derived amino acid sequence of the wheat nad7 gene is strongly conserved relative to its nuclear or organellar counterparts in other organisms. C-to-U type RNA editing, which is observed at 32 positions within the coding region of wheat nad7 transcripts, strengthens protein sequence similarity. RNA editing is also predicted to improve base-pairing within the domain V/VI regions of all four introns."

"16204196","abstracttext","The hypomethylated fraction of plant genomes is usually enriched in genes and can be selectively cloned using methylation filtration (MF). Therefore, MF has been used as a gene enrichment technology in sorghum and maize, where gene enrichment was proportional to genome size. Here we apply MF to a broad variety of plant species spanning a wide range of genome sizes. Differential methylation of genic and non-genic sequences was observed in all species tested, from non-vascular to vascular plants, but in some cases, such as wheat and pine, a lower than expected level of enrichment was observed. Remarkably, hexaploid wheat and pine show a dramatically large number of gene-like sequences relative to other plants. In hexaploid wheat, this apparent excess of genes may reflect an abundance of methylated pseudogenes, which may thus be more prevalent in recent polyploids."

"24058161","abstracttext","Grain hardness is an important quality trait in wheat. This trait is related to the variation in, and the presence of, puroindolines (PINA and PINB). This variation can be increased by the allelic polymorphism present in the Aegilops species that are related to wheat. This study evaluated allelic Pina and Pinb gene variability in five diploid species of the Aegilops genus, along with the molecular characterization of the main allelic variants found in each species. This polymorphism resulted in 16 alleles for the Pina gene and 24 alleles for the Pinb gene, of which 10 and 17, respectively, were novel. Diverse mutations were detected in the deduced mature proteins of these alleles, which could influence the hardness characteristics of these proteins. This study shows that the diploid species of the Aegilops genus could be a good source of genetic variability for both Pina and Pinb genes, which could be used in breeding programmes to extend the range of different textures in wheat."

Transgenic plants were produced efficiently after delivery by Biolistics™ of the pmi gene into maize and wheat tissues, with mean transformation frequencies of 45% for maize and 20% for wheat. Adjustment of the sucrose and mannose levels in the selection medium essentially eliminated escapes. Transgenic events can be identified as early as 2 months for wheat and 4 months for maize. A simple test, a modified chlorophenol red assay, was used for early identification of transgenic events expressing the pmi gene. Transformation frequencies for both crops exceeded those obtained with the bar and pat genes with selection on either Basta ® or bialaphos."

TabHLH39 showed variable expression in roots, stems, leaves, glumes, pistils and stamens and was induced by polyethylene glycol, salt and cold treatments. Further analysis revealed that TabHLH39 overexpression in Arabidopsis significantly enhanced tolerance to drought, salt and freezing stress during the seedling stage, which was also demonstrated by enhanced abiotic stress-response gene expression and changes to several physiological indices. Therefore, TabHLH39 has potential in transgenic breeding applications to improve abiotic stress tolerance in crops."

F. graminearum disease severity varies depending on the resistance of the host genotype. In this study, we used the field pathogenomics method to investigate gene expression and population structure of isolates collected from wheat lines of varying resistance levels (susceptible, intermediate, and resistant) as well as an axenic control. Differential gene expression was found among isolates collected from different host genotypes. Candidate gene sets were identified for both F. graminearum infection of specific host genotypes and general infection to wheat. Population structure of isolates from different resistance level sources was the same, with all isolates belonging to the NA1 population."

"32119688","abstracttext","The introduction of high-yielding semi-dwarf varieties of wheat into cultivation has led to a ""green revolution."" This has required intensive research into various sources of dwarfism in wheat. However, there has been very little advancement in research on dwarfing genes in rye in comparison to wheat or barley. So far, three dominant dwarfing genes (Ddw1, Ddw3, and Ddw4) and three recessive genes (ct1, ct2, and np) have been characterized and precisely mapped in rye. There is no complete catalog of dwarfing genes available in rye. This paper presents an identification of the source of dwarfism and preliminary characterization of the new recessive gene dw9 from the BK-1 line. The gene was mapped on the long arm of the 6R chromosome and belongs to the GA-insensitive group. The initial characterization of the influence of this gene on morphological traits shows that it significantly affects the decrease of yielding trait parameters.

In this paper, an effective and persistent virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system was established with barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) for Haynaldia villosa. Examination of GFP gene expression showed that the BSMV vector moved systemically from leaf to leaf in inoculated H. villosa plants. This vector, expressing a cDNA fragment of phytoene desaturase (PDS), suppressed the transcript level of endogenous Hv-PDS gene as early as 6 days after inoculation, and caused photobleaching symptoms mainly on the newly developed upper leaves. Moreover, PDS gene silencing phenotype persisted through the whole growing period in H. villosa. With this established VIGS system, function analysis of a powdery mildew resistance related gene Hv-LRR was successfully performed. This is the first report that BSMV can be used for VIGS in a wild relative species of wheat. The established VIGS system will be a powerful reverse genetics tool for gene function study in H. villosa, an important genetic resource for wheat breeding."

A single-copy stretch corresponding to the extreme 3' terminus of the wheat rpl2 gene is co-transcribed with the trans-splicing nad1 exon 4; and, at another unique location, the rps19 segment lacking the 5' coding region is co-transcribed with the downstream nad4L gene. In both cases, the 5' termini of these transcripts map to promoter consensus motifs acquired through genomic reorganization, enabling continued expression of essential downstream genes. In both wheat and rice, the rpl2 and rps19 genomic regions differ in their RNA profiles between germinating embryos and seedlings. The absence of intact rpl2 and rps19 genes in wheat mitochondria is consistent with their inactivation through DNA rearrangement/deletion after the successful transfer of functional copies to the nucleus."
"15306719","articletitle","Enhancing the resistance of triticale by using genes from wheat and rye."
"15306719","abstracttext","At present two separate nomenclature systems exist for wheat and rye. This paper provides a proposed common catalogue of wheat, rye and triticale resistance gene symbols. More than 130 postulated wheat resistance genes are listed. Over 39 rye and 6 triticale resistance (R) genes have been identified and named. Genes responsible for reaction to powdery mildew and to leaf, stem and yellow rusts are the best-represented group of resistance genes. From the common catalogue it can be concluded that there exists a potential for further transfer of rye resistance genes to wheat and triticale. Many molecular markers can be applied for marker-assisted gene transfer, but the expression of the R genes in the new genetic background of triticale remains to be investigated."

"18608504","abstracttext","Based on the sequence of the ochratoxin A polyketide synthase gene (otapksPV), a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system for the specific detection of Penicillium verrucosum in wheat has been developed. In a further approach, a real-time PCR system has been applied to determine the growth kinetics of P. verrucosum in wheat at cell numbers above 10(3) colony-forming units (cfu) ml(-1). The data obtained by real-time PCR correlated well with the data obtained by the plate count technique. For this purpose, the DNA was isolated directly from contaminated wheat without any further enrichment step. In a reverse transcriptase real-time PCR, the expression of the otapksPV gene in wheat was detected 22 days after inoculation and storage at ambient temperature. Reasonable amounts of ochratoxin A, however, could not be detected before day 30. This early activation of ochratoxin A related genes was confirmed by microarray analysis."

"24169671","abstracttext","The geographical distribution of Pm10, Pm11, Pm14, and Pm15 wheat genes for resistance to inappropriate formae speciales of Erysiphe graminis was investigated using gene-for-gene relationships. Pm10 and Pm15 were very common among many indigenous accessions of common wheat collected from various areas in the world. The diversity of genotypes, which consisted of allelic combination at those loci, was high near the center of origin of common wheat and decreased with increasing distance from the center. In Europe, an apparent contrast of predominant genotypes occurred between the south and the north, suggesting that these genes are useful markers for revealing the routes by which common wheat spread in Europe. On a whole, the genes for resistance to inappropriate formae speciales were observed to be widely distributed throughout the world. We suggest that the difference between these genes and the genes for resistance to races of an appropriate forma specialis may only be in their distribution and that of their corresponding avirulence genes."

"25889708","abstracttext","Agropyron cristatum is a wild grass of the tribe Triticeae that is widely grown in harsh environments. As a wild relative of wheat, A. cristatum carries many resistance genes that could be used to broaden the genetic diversity of wheat. Here, we report the transcriptome sequencing of the flag leaf and young spike tissues of a representative tetraploid A. cristatum. More than 90 million reads from the two tissues were assembled into 73,664 unigenes. All unigenes were functionally annotated against the KEGG, COG, and Gene Ontology databases and predicted long non-coding RNAs. Pfam prediction demonstrates that A. cristatum carries an abundance of stress resistance genes. The extent of specific genes and rare alleles make A. cristatum a vital genetic reservoir for the improvement of wheat. Altogether, the available gene resources in A. cristatum facilitate efforts to harness the genetic diversity of wild relatives to enhance wheat."

"26748373","abstracttext","The treatment of 4-days-old wheat seedlings with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) in concentration optimal for their growth (0.1 μM) resulted in a rapid transient almost two-fold increase in the level of cytokinins (CKs). MeJA-induced accumulation of CKs was due to inhibition of both cytokinin oxidase (CKX) (cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase, EC 1.5.99.12) gene expression and activity of this enzyme. Pretreatment of wheat seedlings with MeJA decreased the growth-retarding effect of sodium chloride salinity and accelerated growth recovery after withdrawal of NaCl from the incubation medium. We speculate that this protective effect of the hormone might be due to MeJA's ability to prevent the salinity-induced decline in CK concentration that was caused by inhibition of gene expression and activity of CKX in wheat seedlings. The data might indicate an important role for endogenous cytokinins in the implementation of growth-promoting and protective effects of exogenous MeJA application on wheat plants."

"31182809","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB), which is mainly caused by Fusarium graminearum, is a destructive wheat disease that threatens global wheat production. Fhb1, a quantitative trait locus discovered in Chinese germplasm, provides the most stable and the largest effect on FHB resistance in wheat. Here we show that TaHRC, a gene that encodes a putative histidine-rich calcium-binding protein, is the key determinant of Fhb1-mediated resistance to FHB. We demonstrate that TaHRC encodes a nuclear protein conferring FHB susceptibility and that a deletion spanning the start codon of this gene results in FHB resistance. Identical sequences of the TaHRC-R allele in diverse accessions indicate that Fhb1 had a single origin, and phylogenetic and haplotype analyses suggest that the TaHRC-R allele most likely originated from a line carrying the Dahongpao haplotype. This discovery opens a new avenue to improve FHB resistance in wheat, and possibly in other cereal crops, by manipulating TaHRC sequence through bioengineering approaches."

"33178244","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB), a devastating wheat disease, results in loss of yield and production of mycotoxins including deoxynivalenol (DON) in infected grains. DON is harmful to human and animal health and facilitates the spread of FHB symptoms. Its conversion into DON-3-glucoside (D3G) by UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) is correlated with FHB resistance, and only few gene members in wheat have been investigated. Here, Fusarium graminearum and DON-induced TaUGT6 expression in the resistant cultivar Sumai 3 was cloned and characterized. TaUGT6::GFP was subcellularly located throughout cells. Purified TaUGT6 protein could convert DON into D3G to some extent in vitro . Transformation of TaUGT6 into Arabidopsis increased root tolerance when grown on agar plates containing DON. Furthermore, TaUGT6 overexpression in wheat showed improved resistance to Fusarium spread after F . graminearum inoculation. Overall, this study provides useful insight into a novel UGT gene for FHB resistance in wheat."
"9620269","articletitle","Developmentally regulated organ-, tissue-, and cell-specific expression of calmodulin genes in common wheat."
"9620269","abstracttext","Recently, we reported on the characterization of the calmodulin (CaM) gene family in wheat [44]. We classified wheat CaM genes into four subfamilies (SFs) designated SF-1 to SF-4, each representing a series of homoeoallelic loci on the homoeologous chromosomes of the three genomes of common wheat. Here we studied the expression of these wheat CaM genes in the course of wheat development. Northern blot analysis using SF-specific probes revealed differences in SF expression levels in different organs and stages of development. Subsequently, cell-specific expression of CaM SFs was investigated by in situ RNA hybridization. In developing seeds, all CaM SFs showed highest expression in the embryo and less in the aleurone and in the starchy endosperm. In primary roots, all four CaM SFs were expressed in the root cap, meristematic regions and in differentiating cells. During development of the roots, expression gradually decreased. The wheat glutenin gene, which was used as a control throughout our experiments, was found to be expressed in the starchy endosperm but not in the aleurone, embryos or vegetative tissues. In stems, at advanced stages of growth, differences in cell-specific expression of CaM SFs were found. For example, SF-2 was highly expressed in differentiating phloem fibers. Thus, CaM genes in common wheat exhibit a developmentally regulated organ-, tissue-, cell- and SF-specific expression patterns."
"12021849","articletitle","Two haplotypes of resistance gene analogs have been conserved during evolution at the leaf rust resistance locus Lr10in wild and cultivated wheat."
"12021849","abstracttext","The isolation of genes of agronomic interest such as disease resistance genes is a central issue in wheat research. A good knowledge of the organization and evolution of the genome can greatly help in defining the best strategies for efficient gene isolation. So far, very few wheat disease resistance loci have been studied at the molecular level and little is known about their evolution during polyploidization and domestication. In this study, we have analyzed the haplotype structure at loci orthologous to the leaf rust resistance locus Lr10in hexaploid wheat which spans 350 kb in diploid wheat. Two haplotypes (H1, H2) were defined by the presence (H1) or the absence (H2) of two different resistance gene analogs ( rga1, rga2) at this locus on chromosome 1AS. Both haplotypes were found in a collection of 113 wild and cultivated diploid and polyploid wheat lines and they do not reflect phylogenetic relationships. This indicates an ancient origin for this disease resistance locus and the independent conservation of the two haplotypes throughout the evolution of the wheat genome. Finally, the coding regions of the H1 haplotype RGAs are extremely conserved in all the species. This suggests a selective pressure for maintaining the structural and functional configuration of this haplotype in wheat.

"20225092","articletitle","Overexpression of TaPIEP1, a pathogen-induced ERF gene of wheat, confers host-enhanced resistance to fungal pathogen Bipolaris sorokiniana."
"20225092","abstracttext","Bipolaris sorokiniana is an economically important phytopathogen of wheat and other cereal species. In this paper, a novel pathogen-induced ethylene-responsive factor (ERF) gene of wheat, TaPIEP1, was isolated and characterized. The transcript of TaPIEP1 was significantly and rapidly induced by treatments with B. sorokiniana, and with ethylene (ET), jasmonate (JA), and abscisic acid. Molecular and biochemical assays demonstrated that TaPIEP1 is a new ERF transcription activator belonging to B-3c subgroup of the ERF family. Transgenic wheat lines overexpressing TaPIEP1 were generated by biolistic bombardment and molecular screening. Compared with the host wheat Yangmai12, six stable transgenic wheat lines overexpressing TaPIEP1 that exhibited significantly increased resistance to B. sorokiniana were identified by molecular detection in the T(0)-T(4) generations and by disease resistance tests. The degree of the enhanced resistance was correlated with an accumulation of the transcript level of TaPIEP1. Furthermore, the transcript levels of certain defense-related genes in the ET/JA pathways were markedly increased in the transgenic wheat plants with enhanced resistance. These results reveal that TaPIEP1 overexpression in wheat could obviously improve resistance to B. sorokiniana via activation of some defense genes, and TaPIEP1 gene may be useful in improving crop resistance to the pathogen."
"22112217","articletitle","Salicylic acid regulates basal resistance to Fusarium head blight in wheat."
"22112217","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a destructive disease of cereal crops such as wheat and barley. Previously, expression in wheat of the Arabidopsis NPR1 gene (AtNPR1), which encodes a key regulator of salicylic acid (SA) signaling, was shown to reduce severity of FHB caused by Fusarium graminearum. It was hypothesized that SA signaling contributes to wheat defense against F. graminearum. Here, we show that increased accumulation of SA in fungus-infected spikes correlated with elevated expression of the SA-inducible pathogenesis-related 1 (PR1) gene and FHB resistance. In addition, FHB severity and mycotoxin accumulation were curtailed in wheat plants treated with SA and in AtNPR1 wheat, which is hyper-responsive to SA. In support of a critical role for SA in basal resistance to FHB, disease severity was higher in wheat expressing the NahG-encoded salicylate hydroxylase, which metabolizes SA. The FHB-promoting effect of NahG was overcome by application of benzo (1,2,3), thiadiazole-7 carbothioic acid S-methyl ester, a synthetic functional analog of SA, thus confirming an important role for SA signaling in basal resistance to FHB. We further demonstrate that jasmonate signaling has a dichotomous role in wheat interaction with F. graminearum, constraining activation of SA signaling during early stages of infection and promoting resistance during the later stages of infection."

"26338450","abstracttext","Water deficit and increasing salinization reduce productivity of wheat, the leading crop for human diet. While the complete genome sequence of this crop has not been deciphered, a BAC library screening allowed the isolation of TdERF1, the first ethylene response factor gene from durum wheat. This gene is putatively involved in mediating salt stress tolerance and its characterization provides clues toward understanding the mechanisms underlying the adaptation/tolerance of durum wheat to suboptimal growth conditions. TdERF1 expression is differentially induced by high salt treatment in 2 durum wheat varieties, the salt-tolerant Grecale (GR) and the salt-sensitive Om Rabiaa (OR). To further extend these findings, we show here that the expression of this ERF is correlated with physiological parameters, such as the accumulation of osmo-regulators and membrane integrity, that discriminate between the 2 contrasted wheat genotypes. The data confirm that GR and OR are 2 contrasted wheat genotypes with regard to salt-stress and show that TdERF1 is also induced by water stress with an expression pattern clearly discriminating between the 2 genotypes. These findings suggest that TdERF1 might be involved in responses to salt and water stress providing a potential genetic marker discriminating between tolerant and sensitive wheat varieties."

"26276149","abstracttext_key message","Two novel Wx - B1 null alleles that enlarge the genetic variability for this wheat gene were characterized, whose effects on wheat quality could be different to those of the Wx - B1b allele. The starch composition of wheat grain has a primary influence on flour quality. Wheat starch consists of two types of glucose polymers: amylose (22-35% of the total) and amylopectin (68-75% of the total). Amylose is synthesized by waxy proteins. Several studies have contributed to the catalogue of waxy alleles available for breeders, and the search for novel alleles of these and other proteins related to flour quality continues. In this report, we describe the characterization of two novel Wx-B1 alleles (Wx-B1k and Wx-B1m) in a collection of macha, Indian dwarf and club wheat. Several accessions lacking Wx-B1 protein were detected, and some were caused by the common Wx-B1b null allele. Of the other accessions, four from Indian dwarf wheat showed the insertion of 4 bp within the seventh exon, and one from club wheat had a deletion of four nucleotides in the second exon. These mutations were novel and provisionally catalogued as Wx-B1k and Wx-B1m, respectively, and could be used to enlarge the genetic variability for this gene."

Perennial rye (Secale cereanum, 2n = 2x = 14, RR) cultivar Kriszta has a large gene pool that can be exploited in wheat breeding. It has high protein and dietary fibre content, carries several resistance genes, tolerant to frost and drought, and adapts well to disadvantageous soil and weather conditions. In order to incorporate agronomically useful features from this perennial rye into cultivated wheat, backcross progenies derived from a cross between the wheat line Mv9kr1 and perennial rye 'Kriszta' have been produced, and addition lines disomic for 1R, 4R and 6R chromosomes have been selected using GISH, FISH and SSR markers. Quality measurements showed that addition of 'Kriszta' chromosomes 4R and 6R to the wheat genome had increased the total protein content. The 4R addition line contained slightly, while 1R and 6R additions significantly higher amount of arabinoxylan than the parental wheat line. Besides this, the 6R addition line appeared to be resistant to yellow rust in highly infected nurseries, consequently it may carry a new effective gene different from that harboured in the 1RS.1BL translocation for resistance to this disease."

"29021581","abstracttext","The current rate of yield gain in crops is insufficient to meet the predicted demands. Capturing the yield boost from heterosis is one of the few technologies that offers rapid gain. Hybrids are widely used for cereals, maize and rice, but it has been a challenge to develop a viable hybrid system for bread wheat due to the wheat genome complexity, which is both large and hexaploid. Wheat is our most widely grown crop providing 20% of the calories for humans. Here, we describe the identification of Ms1, a gene proposed for use in large-scale, low-cost production of male-sterile (ms) female lines necessary for hybrid wheat seed production. We show that Ms1 completely restores fertility to ms1d, and encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored lipid transfer protein, necessary for pollen exine development. This represents a key step towards developing a robust hybridization platform in wheat.Heterosis can rapidly boost yield in crop species but development of hybrid-breeding systems for bread wheat remains a challenge. Here, Tucker et al. describe the molecular identification of the wheat Ms1 gene and discuss its potential for large-scale hybrid seed production in wheat."

"29274571","abstracttext","Nuclear Transport Factor 2 (NTF2) functions as a critical regulator in balancing the GTP-and GDP-bound forms of Ran, a class of evolutionarily conserved small GTP-binding protein. During the incompatible interaction between wheat-Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), a cDNA fragment encoding a putative wheat NTF2 gene was found to be significantly induced, suggesting a potential role in wheat resistance to Pst. In this work, the full length of TaNTF2 was obtained, with three copies located on 7A, 7B and 7D chromosomes, respectively. QRT-PCR further verified the up-regulated expression of TaNTF2 in response to avirulent Pst. In addition, TaNTF2 was also induced by exogenous hormone applications, especially JA treatment. Transient expression of TaNTF2 in tobacco cells confirmed its subcellular localization in the cytoplasm, perinuclear area and nucleus. And virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) was used to identify the function of TaNTF2 during an incompatible wheat-Pst interaction. When TaNTF2 was knocked down, resistance of wheat to avirulentPst was decreased, with a bigger necrotic spots, and higher numbers of hyphal branches and haustorial mother cells. Our results demonstrated that TaNTF2 was a contributor for wheat resistance to the stripe rust pathogen, which will help to comprehensively understand the NTF2/Ran modulating mechanism in wheat-Pst interaction."

"32313991","abstracttext_key message","One hundred and thirty four introgressions from Thinopyrum elongatum have been transferred into a wheat background and were characterised using 263 SNP markers. Species within the genus Thinopyrum have been shown to carry genetic variation for a very wide range of traits including biotic and abiotic stresses and quality. Research has shown that one of the species within this genus, Th. elongatum, has a close relationship with the genomes of wheat making it a highly suitable candidate to expand the gene pool of wheat. Homoeologous recombination, in the absence of the Ph1 gene, has been exploited to transfer an estimated 134 introgressions from Th. elongatum into a hexaploid wheat background. The introgressions were detected and characterised using 263 single nucleotide polymorphism markers from a 35 K Axiom ® Wheat-Relative Genotyping Array, spread across seven linkage groups and validated using genomic in situ hybridisation. The genetic map had a total length of 187.8 cM and the average chromosome length was 26.8 cM. Comparative analyses of the genetic map of Th. elongatum and the physical map of hexaploid wheat confirmed previous work that indicated good synteny at the macro-level, although Th. elongatum does not contain the 4A/5A/7B translocation found in wheat."

In silico analysis was performed for reference sequence searching, primer pairs design and sequence assembly. The gene sequence was obtained using Illumina and Sanger sequencing. The complete sequences of TaGRF-2D were obtained for 18 varieties of wheat. The polymorphism in the presence/absence of two GCAGCC repeats in 5' UTR was revealed and the GRF-2D-SSR marker was developed. Our results showed that the alleles 5' UTR-250 and 5' UTR-238 were present in wheat varieties, 5' UTR-250 was presented in the majority of wheat varieties. In Ae. tauschii ssp. strangulata (likely donor of the D-subgenome of polyploid wheat), most accessions carried the 5' UTR-250 allele, whilst most Ae. tauschii ssp. tauschii have 5' UTR-244.

"30080595","abstracttext","Durum wheat is naturally more susceptible to Fusarium graminerum infection in comparison to common wheat. The improvement of durum wheat resistance against F. graminearum is a challenge due to the lack of resistance sources in its gene pool. FHB-resistance factors were introduced in durum wheat by generating recombinant inbred lines (RILs), obtained by crossing the hexaploid resistant accession 02-5B-318 with the susceptible durum wheat cv. Saragolla. In this work we explored the possible contribution of cell wall (CW) in RILs with improved FHB resistance. We thoroughly studied CW components, mycotoxins content and the expression of related genes in different RILs selected for their extremely high and low resistance to FHB. Differences were found in resistant and susceptible lines in the degree of pectin methylesterification and in deoxynivalenol (DON) accumulation after fungal infection. Genes involved in biochemical modification of CW structure (WheatPme-1, Glu-1) and mycotoxins accumulation (ns-LTP-1) were analyzed as putative candidates for FHB resistance. Our results indicate that durum wheat plants with cell wall structure and gene response acquired from common wheat displayed an increased resistance to FHB."

"30952946","abstracttext","Powdery mildew, caused by the biotrophic fungal pathogen Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is a major limitation for wheat yield. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying wheat resistance against powdery mildew remain largely unclear. In this study, we report the role of JASMONATE-ZIM domain protein TaJAZ1 in regulating bread wheat resistance against powdery mildew. We generated transgenic bread wheat lines over-expressing the truncated TaJAZ1 without the Jas motif, which showed increased TaPR1/2 gene expression and reactive oxygen species accumulation, leading to enhanced resistance against powdery mildew. Simultaneously, we identified a Jasmonic acid (JA)-induced bHLH transcription factor TaMYC4 in bread wheat. We demonstrated that TaJAZ1 directly interacts with TaMYC4 to repress its transcriptional activity. Meanwhile, we show that the ZIM domain of TaJAZ1 interacts with the C terminus of TaNINJA, whereas the N-terminal EAR motif of TaNINJA interacts with the transcriptional co-repressor TaTPL. Collectively, our work pinpoints TaJAZ1 as a favorable gene to enhance bread wheat resistance toward powdery mildew, and provides a molecular framework for JA signaling in bread wheat."

"30673382","abstracttext","Wheat stripe rust is one of the most damaging diseases of wheat worldwide. The wheat-Leymus mollis introgression line M8664-3 exhibits all-stage resistance to Chinese stripe rust races. Genetic analysis of stripe rust resistance was performed by crossing M8664-3 with the susceptible line Mingxian169. Analysis of the disease resistance of F 2 and F 2:3 populations revealed that its resistance to Chinese stripe rust race 33 (CYR33) is controlled by a single dominant gene, temporarily designated as YrM8664-3. Genetic and physical mapping showed that YrM8664-3 is located in bin 4AL13-0.59-0.66 close to 4AL12-0.43-0.59 on chromosome 4AL and is flanked by single-nucleotide polymorphism markers AX111655681 and AX109496237 with genetic distances of 5.3 and 2.3 centimorgans, respectively. Resistance spectrum and position analyses indicated that YrM8664-3 may be a novel gene. Molecular detection using the markers linked to YrM8664-3 with wheat varieties commonly cultivated and wheat-L. mollis-derived lines showed that YrM8664-3 is also present in other wheat-L. mollis introgression lines but absent in commercial common wheat cultivars.

Previous studies have indicated that the leaf rust resistance (Lr) gene Lr67, a natural mutation of TaSTP13 encoding a wheat sugar transport protein, confers partial resistance to all three wheat rust species and powdery mildew possibly due to weakened sugar transport activity of TaSTP13 by heterodimerization. However, one major problem that remains unresolved concerns whether TaSTP13 participates in wheat susceptibility to rust and mildew."

"8675004","abstracttext","A 2RL.2BS wheat-rye translocation, present in the wheat germplasm line Hamlet, carries a gene for resistance to Hessian fly biotype L, one of the most virulent biotypes presently encountered in wheat production environments. Unlike several other wheat-rye chromosome translocations common in wheat breeding programs, 2RL lacks genes encoding storage proteins or other easily selected markers. Oligonucleotide primers synthesized from published sequences derived from the R173 family of moderately repetitive rye DNA were used in the DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify specific markers for 2RL. The same primers, when used with DNA extracted from additional wheat-rye translocation lines of importance to the wheat breeding community, gave distinctive PCR products for each genotype. The single primer pair, PAWS5 and PAWS6, may, therefore, have wide applicability for the identification of wheat-rye chromosomal translocations presently encountered in wheat breeding populations."

A virtual contig was used that covered 90 cM (21 Mb) of DNA sequence (with a gap for the 6S/8L junction). Comparison of the positions of orthologous genes on the rice virtual contig and on wheat chromosome 7AS showed that there was an unexpectedly low level of synteny (31.4%) and a high level of chromosome rearrangements (68.6%). The non-syntenous loci were of two classes: wheat and rice genes found at different locations in the genome (32.6%), and ESTs in wheat not present in rice (36.0%). Four starch synthetic genes, GBSSI, SSI, SSIIa and DBEI, were located at similar positions on wheat chromosome 7AS and the virtual rice contig covering wheat chromosome 7AS. A preliminary comparison between the short arms of chromosome 7A and 7D in wheat showed that both chromosomes had a similar level of sequence synteny with rice.

After feeding S. avenae on an artificial diet for 48 h, we first collected watery saliva from them and then separated the salivary proteins using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Gene expression studies showed that infiltration of S. avenae watery saliva in wheat leaves induced a strong salicylic acid-responsive defense but moderate jasmonic acid-dependent defense. Feeding on wheat leaves infiltrated with aphid saliva, compared with untreated leaves, significantly decreased the number of nymphs produced per day and the intrinsic rate of increase of the population of S. avenae. In a choice test against untreated wheat, saliva-infiltrated wheat had repellent effects on aphids. Additionally, electrical penetration graph results showed that the feeding behavior of S. avenae on saliva-treated wheat was negatively affected compared with that on untreated wheat. These findings provided direct evidence that salivary components of S. avenae are involved in the induction of wheat resistance against aphids and further demonstrated the important roles of watery saliva in aphid-plant interactions."

"31484903","abstracttext","The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of wheat gluten on gut microbiota from hamsters and also analyse whether alterations in microbiota could result in wheat gluten's lipid-lowering properties. Four weeks male hamsters were divided into 3 groups (n=10). Two hypercholesterolemic groups were fed for 35 days with hypercholesterolemic diet, containing 20% (w/w) wheat gluten or casein. Wheat gluten significantly reduced serum total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations, and also decreased the liver total cholesterol (TC), free cholesterol (FC), cholesterol ester (CE), triglycerides (TG) concentrations. Wheat gluten group had a higher fecal lipids, total cholesterol (TC) and bile acids (BA) than that of casein group (p < 0.05). Moreover, wheat gluten significantly increased total short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) concentrations in feces. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene revealed that intake of wheat gluten decreased the relative abundances of Firmicutes and Erysipelotrichaceae, but to increased the relative abundances of Bateroidetes, Bacteroidales_S24-7_group and Ruminococcaceae. The lipid lowering properties of wheat gluten was associated with the lower ratio of Firmicutes/Bateroidetes, the lower of the bacterial taxa Erysipelotrichaceae and the higher of the bacterial taxa Bacteroidales_S24-7_group and Ruminococcaceae. These results suggest that wheat gluten modulate cholesterol metabolism by altering intestinal microflora."

"21811579","abstracttext_background","Thioredoxin h (trx h) is closely related to germination of cereal seeds. The cDNA sequences of the thioredoxin s (trx s) gene from Phalaris coerulescens and the thioredoxin h (trx h) gene from wheat are highly homologous, and their expression products have similar biological functions. Transgenic wheat had been formed after the antisense trx s was transferred into wheat, and it had been certified that the expression of trx h decreased in transgenic wheat, and transgenic wheat has high resistance to pre-harvest sprouting."
"21811579","abstracttext_methodology/principal findings","Through analyzing the differential proteome of wheat seeds between transgenic wheat and wild type wheat, the mechanism of transgenic wheat seeds having high resistance to pre-harvest sprouting was studied in the present work. There were 36 differential proteins which had been identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). All these differential proteins are involved in regulation of carbohydrates, esters, nucleic acid, proteins and energy metabolism, and biological stress. The quantitative real time PCR results of some differential proteins, such as trx h, heat shock protein 70, α-amylase, β-amylase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 14-3-3 protein, S3-RNase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and WRKY transcription factor 6, represented good correlation between transcripts and proteins. The biological functions of many differential proteins are consistent with the proposed role of trx h in wheat seeds."

These results will not only play an important role in clarifying the mechanism that transgenic wheat has high resistance to pre-harvest sprouting, but also provide further evidence for the role of trx h in germination of wheat seeds."
"23496930","articletitle","Comparative analysis of protein-protein interactions in the defense response of rice and wheat."
"23496930","abstracttext_background","Despite the importance of wheat as a major staple crop and the negative impact of diseases on its production worldwide, the genetic mechanisms and gene interactions involved in the resistance response in wheat are still poorly understood. The complete sequence of the rice genome has provided an extremely useful parallel road map for genetic and genomics studies in wheat. The recent construction of a defense response interactome in rice has the potential to further enhance the translation of advances in rice to wheat and other grasses. The objective of this study was to determine the degree of conservation in the protein-protein interactions in the rice and wheat defense response interactomes. As entry points we selected proteins that serve as key regulators of the rice defense response: the RAR1/SGT1/HSP90 protein complex, NPR1, XA21, and XB12 (XA21 interacting protein 12)."
"23496930","abstracttext_results","Using available wheat sequence databases and phylogenetic analyses we identified and cloned the wheat orthologs of these four rice proteins, including recently duplicated paralogs, and their known direct interactors and tested 86 binary protein interactions using yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) assays. All interactions between wheat proteins were further tested using in planta bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). Eighty three percent of the known rice interactions were confirmed when wheat proteins were tested with rice interactors and 76% were confirmed using wheat protein pairs. All interactions in the RAR1/SGT1/ HSP90, NPR1 and XB12 nodes were confirmed for the identified orthologous wheat proteins, whereas only forty four percent of the interactions were confirmed in the interactome node centered on XA21. We hypothesize that this reduction may be associated with a different sub-functionalization history of the multiple duplications that occurred in this gene family after the divergence of the wheat and rice lineages."
"23496930","abstracttext_conclusions","The observed high conservation of interactions between proteins that serve as key regulators of the rice defense response suggests that the existing rice interactome can be used to predict interactions in wheat. Such predictions are less reliable for nodes that have undergone a different history of duplications and sub-functionalization in the two lineages."

"28618004","abstracttext","Lipase maturation factor (LMF) family proteins are required for the maturation and transport of active lipoprotein lipases. However, the specific roles of LMF2 remain unknown. In this study, a grain aphid lmf2-like gene fragment was cloned and was highly similar in sequence to a homologous gene in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. An RNAi vector was constructed with this fragment and used for wheat transformation. The expression of the lmf2-like gene in aphid, as well as the growth and reproduction of the aphids, was analyzed after feeding on the transgenic wheat. There were no significant differences in the expression of the lmf2-like gene over development. The expression of the lmf2-like gene was significantly reduced by 27.6% on the fifth day, and 57.6% on the 10th day after feeding. The total number of aphids produced on the transgenic plants was less than the number produced on control plants, and the difference became significant or after 2 weeks. The molting numbers were also reduced in the aphids reared on the transgenic plants. Our findings indicate that lmf2-like genes may have potential as a target gene for the control of grain aphids and show that feeding aphids with wheat expressing lmf2-like RNAi resulted in significant reductions in survival and reproduction."

"28443107","abstracttext","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous small non-coding RNAs that arise from large RNA precursors with a stem-loop structure and play important roles in plant development and responses to environmental stress. Although a hundred and nineteen wheat miRNAs have been identified and registered in the miRBase (Release 21.0, June, 2014; http://www.mirbase.org), the functional characterization of these miRNAs in wheat growth and development is lagging due to lack of effective techniques to investigate endogenous miRNA functions in wheat. Here we report barley stripe mosaic virus(BSMV)-based miRNA overexpression and silence systems that can be applied to study miRNA functions in wheat. By utilizing the BSMV system, we successfully knocked down endogenous miR156 and miR166 levels and over-expressed endogenous miR156 and artificial miRNA against phytoene desaturase gene PDS (amiR-PDS) in wheat. amiR-PDS expression caused a great reduction in endogenous mRNA abundance of PDS gene in wheat plant, leading to leaf obviously photobleaching. miR156 silencing led to a great increase in the mRNA level of its target gene SPL2 , resulting in a leaf-curl phenotype in wheat seedlings. In contrast, overexpression of miR156 led to a significant reduction in the mRNA level of SPL2 in wheat seedlings, resulting in serious delay of the vegetative phase transitions as well as booting and flowering in wheat. These confirmed that miR156 regulates wheat development and booting time through SPL genes. In summary, the BSMV-based miRNA overexpression and silence systems have extraordinary potential not only for functional study of protein-encoding genes but also for miRNA genes in wheat."

Virulence gene inducing plant metabolites induce galactosidase which releases an aglycone readily oxidized by air to a blue pigmented zone at the Rf of the inducer. The method has been used to demonstrate the presence of virulence gene inducers in corn, wheat and rye. The uninduced background level of galactosidase also permits detection of bacterial growth inhibitors after a longer incubation period."

"32733539","articletitle","Balanced Genome Triplication in Wheat Causes Premature Growth Arrest and an Upheaval of Genome-Wide Gene Regulation."
"32733539","abstracttext","Polyploidy, or whole genome duplication (WGD), is a driving evolutionary force across the tree of life and has played a pervasive role in the evolution of the plant kingdom. It is generally believed that a major genetic attribute contributing to the success of polyploidy is increased gene and genome dosage. The evolution of polyploid wheat has lent support to this scenario. Wheat has evolved at three ploidal levels: diploidy, tetraploidy, and hexaploidy. Ample evidence testifies that the evolutionary success, be it with respect to evolvability, natural adaptability, or domestication has dramatically increased with each elevation of the ploidal levels. A long-standing question is what would be the outcome if a further elevation of ploidy is superimposed on hexaploid wheat? Here, we characterized a spontaneously occurring nonaploid wheat individual in selfed progenies of synthetic hexaploid wheat and compared it with its isogenic hexaploid siblings at the phenotypic, cytological, and genome-wide gene-expression levels. The nonaploid manifested severe defects in growth and development, albeit with a balanced triplication of the three wheat subgenomes. Transcriptomic profiling of the second leaf of nonaploid, taken at a stage when phenotypic abnormality was not yet discernible, already revealed significant dysregulation in global-scale gene expression with ca. 25.2% of the 49,436 expressed genes being differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at a twofold change cutoff relative to the hexaploid counterpart. Both up- and downregulated DEGs were identified in the nonaploid vs. hexaploid, including 457 genes showing qualitative alteration, i.e., silencing or activation. Impaired functionality at both cellular and organismal levels was inferred from gene ontology analysis of the DEGs. Homoeologous expression analysis of 9,574 sets of syntenic triads indicated that, compared with hexaploid, the proportions showing various homeologous expression patterns were highly conserved in the nonaploid although gene identity showed moderate reshuffling among some of the patterns in the nonaploid. Together, our results suggest hexaploidy is likely the upper limit of ploidy level in wheat; crossing this threshold incurs severe ploidy syndrome that is preceded by disruptive dysregulation of global gene expression."
"16034625","articletitle","Updating of transposable element annotations from large wheat genomic sequences reveals diverse activities and gene associations."
"16034625","abstracttext","Triticeae species (including wheat, barley and rye) have huge and complex genomes due to polyploidization and a high content of transposable elements (TEs). TEs are known to play a major role in the structure and evolutionary dynamics of Triticeae genomes. During the last 5 years, substantial stretches of contiguous genomic sequence from various species of Triticeae have been generated, making it necessary to update and standardize TE annotations and nomenclature. In this study we propose standard procedures for these tasks, based on structure, nucleic acid and protein sequence homologies. We report statistical analyses of TE composition and distribution in large blocks of genomic sequences from wheat and barley. Altogether, 3.8 Mb of wheat sequence available in the databases was analyzed or re-analyzed, and compared with 1.3 Mb of re-annotated genomic sequences from barley. The wheat sequences were relatively gene-rich (one gene per 23.9 kb), although wheat gene-derived sequences represented only 7.8% (159 elements) of the total, while the remainder mainly comprised coding sequences found in TEs (54.7%, 751 elements). Class I elements [mainly long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons] accounted for the major proportion of TEs, in terms of sequence length as well as element number (83.6% and 498, respectively). In addition, we show that the gene-rich sequences of wheat genome A seem to have a higher TE content than those of genomes B and D, or of barley gene-rich sequences. Moreover, among the various TE groups, MITEs were most often associated with genes: 43.1% of MITEs fell into this category. Finally, the TRIM and copia elements were shown to be the most active TEs in the wheat genome. The implications of these results for the evolution of diploid and polyploid wheat species are discussed."

"31214740","abstracttext_key message","A new powdery mildew resistance gene that can be readily used in wheat breeding, Pm65, was identified in the facultative wheat cultivar Xinmai 208 and mapped to the terminal region of chromosome 2AL. Wheat powdery mildew, a widely occurring disease caused by the biotrophic fungus Blumeriagraminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), poses a serious threat to wheat production. A high breeding priority is to identify powdery mildew resistance genes that can be readily used either alone or in gene complexes involving other disease resistance genes. An F 2 population and 227 F 2:3 families derived from the cross Xinmai 208 × Stardust were generated to map a powdery mildew resistance gene in Xinmai 208, a high-yielding Chinese wheat cultivar. Genetic analysis indicated that Xinmai 208 carries a single dominant powdery mildew resistance gene, designated herein Pm65, and linkage analysis delimited Pm65 to a 0.5 cM interval covering 531.8 Kb (763,289,667-763,821,463 bp) on chromosome 2AL in the Chinese Spring reference sequence. An allelism test indicated that Pm65 is a new gene about 10.3 cM distal to the Pm4 locus. Pm65 was 0.3 cM proximal to Xstars355 and 0.2 cM distal to Xstars356. It conferred near-immunity to 19 of 20 Bgt isolates collected from different wheat-growing regions of the USA. Coming from a high-yield potential cultivar, Pm65 can be directly used to enhance powdery mildew resistance in wheat. The newly developed SSR markers Xstars355 and Xstars356 have the potential to tag Pm65 for wheat improvement."
"30157196","articletitle","Molecular markers and cytogenetics to characterize a wheat-Dasypyrum villosum 3V (3D) substitution line conferring resistance to stripe rust."
"30157196","abstracttext","Dasypyrum villosum has been used as a valuable gene resource for disease resistances, yield increase and quality improvement in wheat. A novel wheat-D. villosum alien introgression line CD-3 was generated through hybridization between the common wheat Chinese Spring (CS) and a CS- D. villosum 3V addition line having considerably high stripe rust resistance, which enable the characterization of a potential new stripe rust resistance gene (s) derived from D. villosum. The results of non-denaturing fluorescent in situ hybridization (ND-FISH) showed that CD-3 contained 42 chromosomes, including a 3V chromosome pair, and the absence of both of the 3D chromosomes. PCR-based Landmark Unique Gene (PLUG) molecular marker analysis supported results from the FISH analysis, revealing CD-3 was a wheat-D. villosum 3V (3D) disomic substitution line. Resistant test of stripe rust on 52 plants of F2 generation (CD-3/CS), CD-3, CS and D.villosum have been conducted at seedling stage. 7 plants of F2 generation possessing two 3V chromosomes exhibited high resistance to stripe rust as CD-3 and D.villosum, 10 plants carrying one 3V chromosome and 35 plants without 3V chromosome were susceptive to stripe rust as CS. The result implied the high stripe rust resistance of CD-3 should be controlled by recessive gene(s) originating from D.villosum. To rapidly detect chromosome 3V in the genetic background of wheat, we developed a novel Sequence Characterized Amplified Region (SCAR) marker specific for 3V chromosome based on the sequence of a grain size-related gene DvGS5 in D. villosum, an orthologue of TaGS5 from wheat. The SCAR marker was designated DvGS5-1443, which could successfully amplify a unique 3V-specific fragment in CD-3 and D. villosum, suggesting that this SCAR marker could facilitate targeting the chromosome 3V in the genetic background of wheat for wheat improvement."

"2798132","abstracttext","We have identified genes encoding a ""native"" tRNA(Asp) (trnD-GTC) and a ""chloroplast-like"" tRNA(Asn) (trnN-GTT) on opposite strands and 633 bp apart within a sequenced 1640 bp RsaI restriction fragment of wheat mtDNA. The trnD gene has been found previously at a different location in wheat mtDNA (P.B.M. Joyce et al. (1988) Piant Mol. Biol. 11, 833-843); the duplicate copies of this gene are identical within the coding and immediate flanking regions (9 bp downstream and at least 68 bp upstream), after which obvious sequence similarity abruptly disappears. The trnN gene is identical to its homolog in maize ctDNA; continuation of sequence similarity beyond the coding region suggests that this gene originated as promiscuous ctDNA that is now part of the wheat mitochondrial genome. In the course of this work, we have encountered some unexpected similarities between tRNA gene regions from wheat mitochondria and other sources. Detailed analysis of these similarities leads us to suggest that trnN genes reportedly from petunia nuclear DNA (N. Bawnik et al. (1983) Nucleic Acids Res. 11, 1117-1122) and lupine mtDNA (B. Karpińska and H. Augustyniak (1988) Nucleic Acids Res. 16, 6239) are, in fact, from petunia mtDNA and lupine ctDNA, respectively, whereas a putative wheat nuclear tRNA(Ser) (trnS-TGA) gene (Z. Szwekowska-Kulińska et al. (1989) Gene 77, 163-167) is actually from wheat mtDNA. In these instances, it seems probable that the DNA samples used for cloning contained trace amounts of DNA from another sub-cellular compartment, leading to the inadvertent selection of spurious clones."

In addition to the WM1 gene family, a number of other genes, gene fragments and pseudogenes were identified. It has been predicted that there is approximately one gene every 19-kb and that this region of the wheat genome contains 23 repetitive elements including BARE-1 and Wis2-1 like sequences. Nearly 50% of the repetitive elements identified were similar to known transposons from the CACTA superfamily. Ty1-copia, Ty3-gypsy and Athila LTR retroelements were also prevalent within the region. The WM1 gene cluster is present on 3DS and on barley 3HS but missing from the A and B genomes of hexaploid wheat. This suggests either recent generation of the cluster or specific deletion of the cluster during wheat polyploidisation. The evolutionary significance of the cluster, its possible roles in disease response or floral and early meiotic development and its location at or near the Ph2 locus are discussed."
"28856649","articletitle","Chromosome Engineering Techniques for Targeted Introgression of Rust Resistance from Wild Wheat Relatives."
"28856649","abstracttext","Hexaploid wheat has relatively narrow genetic diversity due to its evolution and domestication history compared to its wild relatives that often carry agronomically important traits including resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Many genes have been introgressed into wheat from wild relatives using various strategies and protocols. One of the important issues with these introgressions is linkage drag, i.e., in addition to beneficial genes, undesirable or deleterious genes that negatively influence end-use quality and grain yield are also introgressed. Linkage drag is responsible for limiting the use of alien genes in breeding programs. Therefore, a lot of effort has been devoted to reduce linkage drag. If a gene of interest is in the primary gene pool or on a homologous chromosome from species in the secondary gene pool, it can be introgressed into common wheat by direct crosses and homologous recombination. However, if a gene of interest is on a homoeologous chromosome of a species belonging to the secondary or tertiary gene pools, chromosome engineering is required to make the transfer and to break any linkage drag. Four general approaches are used to transfer genes from homoeologous chromosomes of wild relatives to wheat chromosomes, namely, spontaneous translocations, radiation, tissue culture, and induced homoeologous recombination. The last is the method of choice provided the target gene(s) is not located near the centromere where recombination is lacking or is suppressed, and synteny between the alien chromosome carrying the gene and the recipient wheat chromosome is conserved. In this chapter, we focus on the homoeologous recombination-based chromosome engineering approach and use rust resistance genes in wild relatives of wheat as examples. The methodology will be applicable to other alien genes and other crops."

"30116253","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by the biotrophic fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ), is one of the most widespread and destructive wheat diseases worldwide. Growing resistant cultivars is an effective approach for controlling this disease. However, because host resistance genes were easily overcome by new virulent Pst races, there is a continuous demand for identifying new effective wheat stripe rust resistance genes and develop closely linked markers for marker-assisted selection (MAS). Baidatou, an old Chinese wheat landrace, has been grown for several decades in Longnan region, Gansu Province, where stripe rust epidemics are frequent and severe. In our previous study, a single dominant gene YrBai in Baidatou was identified to control the adult-plant resistance (APR) to Chinese prevalent Pst race CYR33. And the gene was located on wheat chromosome 6DS by four polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) and two sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers, with the genetic distances of two closely linked markers 3.6 and 5.4 cM, respectively. To further confirm the APR gene in Baidatou and construct the high-density map for the resistance gene, adult plants of F 1 , F 2 , F 3 , and F 5:6 populations derived from the cross Mingxian169/Baidatou and two parents were inoculated with CYR33 at Yangling field, Shaanxi Province during 2014-2015, 2015-2016, and 2016-2017 crop seasons, respectively. The field evaluation results indicated that a single dominant gene confers the APR to Pst race CYR33 in Baidatou. 92 F 3 lines and parents were sequenced using DArTseq technology based on wheat GBS1.0 platform, and 31 genetic maps consisted of 2,131 polymorphic SilicoDArT and 952 SNP markers spanning 4,293.94 cM were constructed. Using polymorphic SilicoDArT, SNP markers and infection types (ITs) data of F 3 lines, the gene YrBai was further located in 0.8 cM region on wheat chromosome 6D. These closely linked markers developed in this study should be useful for MAS for Baidatou in crop improvement and map-based clone this gene."

"1388032","abstracttext","Two alloplasmic wheat lines having the same common wheat nucleus but the cytoplasms of Aegilops crassa and Ae. columnaris together with the corresponding normal line (control) were used in the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of soluble and thylakoid membrane proteins of the chloroplast. Three chloroplast polypeptides: the Rubisco large subunit, the beta subunit of ATP synthase, and an unidentified 31 kDa protein, differed in the common wheat and two Aegilops cytoplasms. Three chloroplast genes, atpB, atpE and trnM, that respectively encode the beta and epsilon subunits of ATP synthase and tRNA(met), were sequenced. The atpB gene differed by two synonymous base substitutions, whereas the other two genes were identical in the two Aegilops cytoplasms. From the predicted amino acid sequences, the beta subunits of the ATP synthase in the Aegilops cytoplasms were assumed to have three amino acid substitutions: Ala by Val, Asp- by Ala, and Gln by Lys+, in contrast to the cytoplasm of common wheat. This accounts for the difference in pI values found for the common wheat and Aegilops cytoplasms. The two base substitutions for the atpE genes of common wheat and the Aegilops cytoplasms were synonymous. The differences detected in the genes encoding the two subunits of ATP synthase do not appear to be ascribable to the differences in phenotypic effects for the common wheat and Aegilops cytoplasms. The base substitution rate of the atpB-atpE-trnM gene cluster was similar to that of the rbcL gene. From the rate for the atpB gene alone, evolutionary divergence of the wheat-Aegilops complex is assumed to have begun ca. 3.0 x 10(6) years ago, as compared to ca. 8.0 x 10(6) years ago for the divergence of the wheat-Aegilops complex and barley."

"9729767","abstracttext","The wheat genome is large, hexaploid, and contains a high amount of repetitive sequences. In order to isolate agronomically important genes from wheat by map-based cloning, a simpler model of the genome must be used for identifying candidate genes. The objective of this study was to comparatively map the genomic regions of two wheat leaf rust disease resistance loci, Lr1 and Lr10, in the putative model genomes of rice and barley. Two probes cosegregating with the Lr1 gene on chromosome 5DL of wheat were studied. The rice sequences corresponding to the two probes were isolated and mapped. The two probes mapped to two different rice chromosomes, indicating that the organization of the region orthologous to Lr1 is different in rice and wheat. In contrast, synteny was conserved between wheat and barley in this chromosomal region. The Lrk10 gene cosegregated with Lr10 on chromosome 1AS in wheat. The rice gene corresponding to Lrk10 was mapped on rice chromosome 1, where it occurred in many copies. This region on rice chromosome 1 corresponds to the distal part of the group 3S chromosomes in Triticeae. The synteny is conserved between rice chromosome 1 and the Triticeae group 3S chromosomes up to the telomere of the chromosomes. On group 3S chromosomes, we found a gene that is partially homologous to Lrk10. We conclude that in the genomic regions studied, there is limited and only partially useful synteny between wheat and rice. Therefore, barley should also be considered as a model genome for isolating the Lr1 and Lr10 genes from wheat."
"16535606","articletitle","Induced Reporter Gene Activity, Enhanced Stress Resistance, and Competitive Ability of a Genetically Modified Pseudomonas fluorescens Strain Released into a Field Plot Planted with Wheat."
"16535606","abstracttext","The fates of Pseudomonas fluorescens R2fR and its mutant derivative RIWE8, which contains a lacZ reporter gene responsive to wheat root exudate, were compared in a field microplot. Inoculant survival, root colonization, translocation, resistance to stress factors, and reporter gene activity were assessed in bulk and wheat rhizosphere soils. Populations of both strains declined gradually in bulk and wheat rhizosphere soils and on the wheat rhizoplane as determined by specific CFU and immunofluorescence (IF). In samples from both bulk soil and wheat rhizosphere, IF cell counts were up to 3 orders of magnitude greater than the corresponding numbers of CFU after 120 days, indicating the presence of nonculturable inoculant cells. Estimates of RIWE8-specific target DNA molecule numbers in bulk soil samples 3 and 120 days after inoculation by most-probable-number PCR coincided with the corresponding CFU values. Transport of both strains to deeper soil layers was observed by 3 days after introduction into the microplot. Both strains colonized wheat roots similarly, and cells were seen scattered on the surface of 1-month-old wheat seedling roots by immunogold labelling-scanning electron microscopy. On average, reporter gene activity was significantly higher in wheat rhizosphere soil containing RIWE8 cells than in bulk soil or in soils containing R2fR cells. For both strains, resistance to the four stress factors ethanol, high temperature, high osmotic tension, and oxidative stress increased progressively with residence in soil. Cells from the rhizosphere of 11-day-old seedlings showed similar levels of resistance to osmotic and oxidative stresses and enhanced resistance to ethanol and heat as compared to cells from bulk soil. By 37 days, populations of R2fR and RIWE8 in the rhizosphere were significantly more sensitive to osmotic stress than were populations in bulk soil, whereas differences in response to the other stress factors were less evident. Hence, except for the induction of reporter gene expression in strain RIWE8 in the wheat rhizosphere, the data indicated that there were no great differences in the ecological properties in soil between the lacZ-modified and parental strains."
"16941906","articletitle","Gene-for-gene defense of wheat against the Hessian fly lacks a classical oxidative burst."
"16941906","abstracttext","Genetic similarities between plant interactions with microbial pathogens and wheat interactions with Hessian fly larvae prompted us to investigate defense and counterdefense mechanisms. Plant oxidative burst, a rapid increase in the levels of active oxygen species (AOS) within the initial 24 h of an interaction with pathogens, commonly is associated with defenses that are triggered by gene-for-gene recognition events similar to those involving wheat and Hessian fly larvae. RNAs encoded by Hessian fly superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) genes, involved in detoxification of AOS, increased in first-instar larvae during both compatible and incompatible interactions. However, mRNA levels of a wheat NADPH oxidase (NOX) gene that generates superoxide (O2-) did not increase. In addition, inhibiting wheat NOX enzyme with diphenyleneiodonium did not result in increased survival of avirulent larvae. However, nitro blue tetrazolium staining indicated that basal levels of O2- are present in both uninfested and infested wheat tissue. mRNA encoded by wheat genes involved in detoxification of the cellular environment, SOD, CAT, and glutathione-S-transferase did not increase in abundance. Histochemical staining with 3,3-diaminobenzidine revealed no increases in wheat hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) during infestation that were correlated with the changes in larval SOD and CAT mRNA. However, treatment with 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin demonstrated the presence of basal levels of H2O2 in the elongation zone of both infested and uninfested plants. The accumulation of a wheat flavanone 3-hydroxylase mRNA did show some parallels with larval gene mRNA profiles. These results suggested that larvae encounter stresses imposed by mechanisms other than an oxidative burst in wheat seedlings."
"28119710","articletitle","Artificial MicroRNA-Based Specific Gene Silencing of Grain Hardness Genes in Polyploid Cereals Appeared to Be Not Stable Over Transgenic Plant Generations."
"28119710","abstracttext","Gene silencing by RNA interference is a particularly important tool in the study of gene function in polyploid cereal species for which the collections of natural or induced mutants are very limited. Previously we have been testing small interfering RNA-based approach of gene silencing in wheat and triticale. In this research, artificial microRNAs (amiRs) were studied in the same species and the same target genes to compare effectiveness of both gene silencing pathways. amiR cassettes were designed to silence Puroindoline a ( Pina ) and Puroindoline b ( Pinb ) hardness genes in wheat and their orthologues Secaloindoline a ( Sina ) and Secaloindoline b ( Sinb ) genes in triticale. Each of the two cassettes contained 21 nt microRNA (miR) precursor derived from conserved regions of Pina / Sina or Pinb / Sinb genes, respectively. Transgenic plants were obtained with high efficiency in two cultivars of wheat and one cultivar of triticale after using the Pinb -derived amiR vector for silencing of Pinb or Sinb , respectively. Lack of transgenic plants in wheat or very low transformation efficiency in triticale was observed using the Pina -derived amiR cassette, despite large numbers of embryos attempted. Silencing of Pinb in wheat and Sinb in triticale was highly efficient in the T 1 generation. The transcript level of Pinb in wheat was reduced up to 92% and Sinb in triticale was reduced up to 98%. Moreover, intended silencing of Pinb / Sinb with Pinb -derived amiR cassette was highly correlated with simultaneous silencing of Pina / Sina in the same transgenic plants. High downregulation of Pinb / Pina genes in T 1 plants of wheat and Sinb / Sina genes in T 1 plants of triticale was associated with strong expression of Pinb -derived amiR. Silencing of the target genes correlated with increased grain hardness in both species. Total protein content in the grains of transgenic wheat was significantly lower. Although, the Pinb -derived amiR cassette was stably inherited in the T 2 generation of wheat and triticale the silencing effect including strongly decreased expression of silenced genes as well as strong expression of Pinb -derived amiR was not transmitted. Advantages and disadvantages of posttranscriptional silencing of target genes by means of amiR and siRNA-based approaches in polyploid cereals are discussed."

Eight replicated field experiments were conducted using seed mixtures of 0, 5, 10, 15 and 100% or 0, 5 and 100% susceptible wheat with an agronomically similar wheat expressing the antibiotic resistance gene Sm1. The frequencies of eggs, mature larvae and parasitized larvae in susceptible and resistant wheat spikes, and midge-affected seeds in the harvest, were recorded for each plot. In susceptible wheat, insect densities and seed damage were typical of those in commercial wheat. In resistant wheat, few larvae completed development, 2% or less compared with about 80% in susceptible wheat, when larvae were sampled at maturity. This resistant wheat also deterred midge oviposition, reducing egg densities by 65% compared with susceptible wheat. The wheat midge and its parasitoid oviposited throughout the plots, and parasitism was density independent. The densities of mature midge larvae and parasitoids were in proportion to the size of the refuge. A 5% susceptible refuge produced about 41 mature larvae for each mature larva from the resistant wheat, and provided effective control of damage. An interspersed refuge of susceptible plants in resistant wheat is a promising strategy for sustaining resistance conferred by Sm1 and biocontrol of the wheat midge."

"1377099","abstracttext","The single copy nad5 gene has been identified in the mitochondrial genomes of cauliflower, chicory, potato, fennel, and common bean. In these five dicot species the same organization as in Oenothera, Arabidopsis, wheat, and maize has been found for the gene: it consists of five exons organized into three independent groups. The first group comprises exons I and II, separated by a highly conserved group II intron, while the second group consists of exon III only. In the third group exons IV and V are separated by a group II intron of variable, species-specific, length. Transcription analysis of the nad5 gene in chicory and in cauliflower shows that the five exons are assembled as a mature mRNA through intermolecular interactions and multiple splicing events. Comparison of transcription in the gene with that of wheat and maize suggests that a common mechanism exists in higher plants for nad5 transcript processing."

Restriction-fragment variation associated with previously established allelic differences between varieties was observed. Also, there is a clear relationship between the electrophoretic mobility of a HMW subunit and the length of the central repetitive section of the gene encoding it. These results are discussed with reference to the evolution of the HMW glutenin gene family and the uses of restriction-fragment variation in plant breeding and genetics."

An 0.71-kb transcript is specific to nad1 exon d whereas a 1.2-kb transcript is specific to the nad6 gene. Three larger transcripts hybridize to both probes suggesting that nad1 exon d and nad6 are co-transcribed. This co-transcription has been directly demonstrated by cDNA synthesis on mtRNAs and sequencing of the PCR amplification product."

The design of the gene included four features: different construction strategies for the separate assembly of major polypeptide domains, the inclusion of convenient restriction sites for modifications, use of a codon selection similar to E. coli highly expressed genes, and the ability to produce repetitive sequence domains of exact numbers of defined repeats. The complete synthetic HMW-glutenin construct was 1908 bp, and contained 32 identical copies of one of the HMW-glutenin repetitive domain motifs. The gene expressed the novel HMW-glutenin protein to relatively high levels in bacterial cultures and the protein exhibited the known anomalous behavior of HMW-glutenins in SDS-PAGE."

The enzyme is unique in terms of catalyzing both decarboxylation and transamination. Although the enzymatic activity is present in some bacteria and fungi, the biological role is unclear. We identified and disrupted the dialkylglycine decarboxylase-encoding gene DGD1 in the wheat blotch fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola by transposon-arrayed gene knockout. The DGD1 gene is highly similar to dialkylglycine decarboxylase from the soil bacterium Burkholderia cepacia. Phylogenetic analysis of various class III aminotransferases showed that dialkylglycine decarboxylases from bacteria and fungi are found in a distinct cluster. Functional analysis revealed that dgd1 disruption mutants display wild-type morphology and pathogenicity to wheat. The dgd1 mutants cannot utilize 2-methylalanine as a sole nitrogen source, as assessed by large-scale nutritional utilization analysis. This is the first description of a mutant phenotype of the fungal dialkylglycine decarboxylase gene."

Glyphosate resistance was confirmed in K. scoparia populations collected from sugarbeet fields in Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska, and Montana. Glyphosate resistance was also confirmed in K. scoparia accessions collected from wheat-fallow fields in Montana. All GR samples had increased EPSPS gene copy number, with median population values up to 11 from sugarbeet fields and up to 13 in Montana wheat-fallow fields. The results indicate that glyphosate susceptibility can be accurately diagnosed using EPSPS gene copy number."

"29269474","abstracttext","Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici ( Pgt ) causes wheat stem rust, a devastating fungal disease. The Sr35 resistance gene confers immunity against this pathogen's most virulent races, including Ug99.

The AvrSr35 gene encodes a secreted protein capable of interacting with Sr35 and triggering the immune response. We show that the origin of Pgt isolates virulent on Sr35 is associated with the nonfunctionalization of the AvrSr35 gene by the insertion of a mobile element. The discovery of AvrSr35 provides a new tool for Pgt surveillance, identification of host susceptibility targets, and characterization of the molecular determinants of immunity in wheat."

"20565711","abstracttext_background","Among the dietary essential amino acids, the most severely limiting in the cereals is lysine. Since cereals make up half of the human diet, lysine limitation has quality/nutritional consequences. The breakdown of lysine is controlled mainly by the catabolic bifunctional enzyme lysine ketoglutarate reductase - saccharopine dehydrogenase (LKR/SDH). The LKR/SDH gene has been reported to produce transcripts for the bifunctional enzyme and separate monofunctional transcripts. In addition to lysine metabolism, this gene has been implicated in a number of metabolic and developmental pathways, which along with its production of multiple transcript types and complex exon/intron structure suggest an important node in plant metabolism. Understanding more about the LKR/SDH gene is thus interesting both from applied standpoint and for basic plant metabolism."
"20565711","abstracttext_results","The current report describes a wheat genomic fragment containing an LKR/SDH gene and adjacent genes. The wheat LKR/SDH genomic segment was found to originate from the A-genome of wheat, and EST analysis indicates all three LKR/SDH genes in hexaploid wheat are transcriptionally active. A comparison of a set of plant LKR/SDH genes suggests regions of greater sequence conservation likely related to critical enzymatic functions and metabolic controls. Although most plants contain only a single LKR/SDH gene per genome, poplar contains at least two functional bifunctional genes in addition to a monofunctional LKR gene. Analysis of ESTs finds evidence for monofunctional LKR transcripts in switchgrass, and monofunctional SDH transcripts in wheat, Brachypodium, and poplar."
"20565711","abstracttext_conclusions","The analysis of a wheat LKR/SDH gene and comparative structural and functional analyses among available plant genes provides new information on this important gene. Both the structure of the LKR/SDH gene and the immediately adjacent genes show lineage-specific differences between monocots and dicots, and findings suggest variation in activity of LKR/SDH genes among plants. Although most plant genomes seem to contain a single conserved LKR/SDH gene per genome, poplar possesses multiple contiguous genes. A preponderance of SDH transcripts suggests the LKR region may be more rate-limiting. Only switchgrass has EST evidence for LKR monofunctional transcripts. Evidence for monofunctional SDH transcripts shows a novel intron in wheat, Brachypodium, and poplar."

The product(s) of these general genes may be necessary for the expression of various host Sr genes. The evolution of a super race capable of overcoming many Sr genes for resistance seems likely, as such a pathogen would not have to give up the many proteins predicted by the gene-for-gene relationship. Moreover, it appears that specificity in the wheat rust system is more complicated than suggested by the gene-for-gene concept."

A total of 157 F(4) plants from a single F(3) plant with 2n = 42 tested with PST-100 segregated in a 3 resistant: 1 susceptible ratio, indicating that a single dominant gene from PI 480148 conferred resistance. Using the F(3:4) population and the resistance gene-analog polymorphism (RGAP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, the gene was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 2B. SSR marker Xwmc441 and RGAP marker XLRRrev/NLRRrev ( 350 ) flanked the resistance gene by 5.6 and 2.7 cM, respectively. The effective resistance of the gene to an Australian Pst isolate virulent to Yr5, which is also located on 2BL and confers resistance to all US Pst races, together with an allelism test of the two genes, indicated that the gene from PI 480148 is different from Yr5 and should be a new and useful gene for resistance to stripe rust. Resistant common wheat lines with plant types similar to AvS were selected for use in breeding programs."

"29927977","abstracttext","Optimizing wheat height to maximize yield has been an important aspect which is evident from a successful example of green revolution. Dwarfing genes (Rht) are known for yield gains due to lodging resistance and partitioning of assimilates into ear. The available and commercially exploited sources of dwarfism in Indian spring wheat are Rht1 and Rht2 genes inspite of availability of over 20 dwarfing genes. Rht8 a Gibberellic acid sensitive dwarfing gene is another reduced height gene commercially exploited in some Mediterranean countries. Two F2 populations segregating for Rht1 and Rht8 genes with each comprising 398 and 379 plants were developed by crossing European winter wheat cultivars Beauchamp and Capitole with Indian spring wheat cultivar PBW 621. Different genotypic combinations for Rht1 and Rht8 genes were selected from these populations through linked molecular markers and selected F3:4 lines were evaluated for various agronomic traits in a replicated trial. Reduction in plant height with Rht8 and Rht1 averaged 2.86% and 13.3% respectively as compared to the group of lines lacking dwarfing gene. Reduction was spread along all the internodes of wheat culm and reduction was lower as progress towards the lower internode. Grain number per spike and highest yield was observed in lines carrying only Rht1 gene. Reduction in plant biomass was observed with either of the dwarfing gene. Longest coleoptile length and seedling shoot length averaged 4.4 ± 0.09 cm and 19.5 ± 0.48, respectively was observed in lines lacking any of the dwarfing gene. Negligible reduction of 6.75% and 2.84% in coleoptile length and seedling shoot length, respectively was observed in lines carrying only Rht8 gene whereas F3:4 lines with Rht1 gene showed 21.64% and 23.35% reduction in coleoptile length and seedling shoot length, respectively. Additive effect of genes was observed as double dwarfs showed 43.31% and 43.34% reduction in coleoptile length and seedling shoot length."

The evaluation was done with embryogenic cells of Picea glauca, where the relative strengths of the promoters were 35S-35S-AMVE>35S-AMVE>35S-35S>35S as evaluated by transient gene expression. The fusion gene of GUS and NPT II gave lower levels of transient gene expression than the unfused GUS gene as detected by X-GLU histochemical assays. Experiments comparing the EM promoter of wheat and the 35S-35S-AMVE promoter (with and without fusion between GUS and NPT II) were done in Picea rubens, P. mariana, P. glauca, and Larix x eurolepis. The unfused gene with the 35S-35S-AMVE promoter gave higher levels of transient gene expression than the fused GUS-NPT II gene. The fluorescent MUG assay was more sensitive than the histochemical X-GLU assay to detect the activity of the β-glucuronidase gene."

"24301080","abstracttext","Co-evolution of fungal pathogens with their host species during the domestication of modern crop varieties has likely affected the current genetic divergence of pathogen populations. The objective of this study was to determine if the evolutionary history of the obligate rust pathogen on wheat, Puccinia triticina, is correlated with adaptation to hosts with different ploidy levels. Sequence data from 15 loci with different levels of polymorphism were generated. Phylogenetic analyses (parsimony, Bayesian, maximum likelihood) showed the clear initial divergence of P. triticina isolates collected from Aegilops speltoides (the likely B genome donor of modern wheat) in Israel from the other isolates that were collected from tetraploid (AB genomes) durum wheat and hexaploid (ABD genomes) common wheat. Coalescence-based genealogy samplers also indicated that P. triticina on A. speltoides, diverged initially, followed by P. triticina isolates from durum wheat in Ethiopia and then by isolates from common wheat. Isolates of P. triticina found worldwide on cultivated durum wheat were the most recently coalesced and formed a clade nested within the isolates from common wheat. By a relative time scale, the divergence of P. triticinia as delimited by host specificity appears very recent. Significant reciprocal gene flow between isolates from common wheat and isolates from durum wheat that are found worldwide was detected, in addition to gene flow from isolates on common wheat to isolates on durum wheat in Ethiopia."

"26720854","abstracttext","Sharp eyespot, caused mainly by the necrotrophic fungus Rhizoctonia cerealis, limits wheat production worldwide. Here, TaCPK7-D, encoding a subgroup III member of the calcium-dependent protein kinase (CPK) family, was identified from the sharp eyespot-resistant wheat line CI12633 through comparative transcriptomic analysis. Subsequently, the defence role of TaCPK7-D against R. cerealis infection was studied by the generation and characterization of TaCPK7-D-silenced and TaCPK7-D-overexpressing wheat plants. Rhizoctonia cerealis inoculation induced a higher transcriptional level of TaCPK7-D in the resistant wheat line CI12633 than in the susceptible cultivar Wenmai 6. The expression of TaCPK7-D was significantly induced after exogenous application of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (an ethylene biosynthesis precursor). The green fluorescent protein signal distribution assays indicated that TaCPK7-D localizes to the plasma membrane in both onion epidermal cells and wheat protoplasts. Following R. cerealis inoculation, TaCPK7-D-silenced wheat CI12633 plants displayed more severe sharp eyespot symptoms than control CI12633 plants. Four defence-associated genes (β-1,3-glucanase, chitinase 1, defensin and TaPIE1) and an ethylene biosynthesis key gene, ACO2, were significantly suppressed in the TaCPK7-D-silenced wheat plants compared with control plants. Conversely, TaCPK7-D-overexpressing wheat lines showed increased resistance to sharp eyespot compared with untransformed recipient wheat Yangmai 16. Furthermore, the transcriptional levels of these four defence-related genes and ACO2 gene were significantly elevated in TaCPK7-D-overexpressing plants compared with untransformed recipient wheat plants. These results suggest that TaCPK7-D positively regulates the wheat resistance response to R. cerealis infection through the modulation of the expression of these defence-associated genes, and that TaCPK7-D is a candidate to improve sharp eyespot resistance in wheat."

"30786597","abstracttext","The stem rust resistance gene Sr31 derived from rye has been used as an important source of stem rust resistance in many wheat cultivars worldwide. Isolates of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici with virulence to Sr31 were identified from Uganda in 1999. Stem rust susceptibility in wheat lines with Sr31 was observed in Kenya in 2003 and 2004. An isolate collected from Uganda in 1999 and an isolate collected from Kenya in 2004, identified to be race TTKS, were used in the rust evaluations. Selected cultivars and advanced breeding lines (450 in total) of wheat from the United States were tested against these two stem rust isolates. Resistance to race TTKS was detected in major classes of wheat with the following frequencies: 16% of hard red spring wheat, 48% of hard red winter wheat, and 27% of soft winter wheat. The genes that conferred resistance in the spring wheat have not been conclusively identified. Resistance in cultivar Ivan was likely due to Sr24. Resistance in hard red winter wheat was postulated to be primarily due to Sr24, and resistance in soft winter wheat was postulated to be primarily due to Sr36. The 1AL.1RS translocation present in many U.S. winter wheat cultivars and breeding lines appears to carry an effective resistance gene different from Sr31. The presence of resistance to race TTKS in the adapted germ plasm presents an opportunity to improve stem rust resistance in wheat."

Hexaploid bread wheat was formed by two rounds of interspecific hybridization and polyploidization, processes which are often accompanied by genetic and epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation. However, the extent and effect of such changes during wheat evolution, particularly from tetraploid-to-hexaploid wheat, are currently elusive."
"33218336","abstracttext_results","Here we report genome-wide DNA methylation landscapes in extracted tetraploid wheat (ETW, AABB), natural hexaploid wheat (NHW, AABBDD), resynthesized hexaploid wheat (RHW, AABBDD), natural tetraploid wheat (NTW, AABB), and diploid (DD). In the endosperm, levels of DNA methylation, especially in CHG (H=A, T, or C) context, were dramatically decreased in the ETW relative to natural hexaploid wheat; hypo-differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (850,832) were 24-fold more than hyper-DMRs (35,111). Interestingly, those demethylated regions in ETW were remethylated in the resynthesized hexaploid wheat after the addition of the D genome. In ETW, hypo-DMRs correlated with gene expression, and TEs were demethylated and activated, which could be silenced in the hexaploid wheat. In NHW, groups of TEs were dispersed in genic regions of three subgenomes, which may regulate the expression of TE-associated genes. Further, hypo-DMRs in ETW were associated with reduced H3K9me2 levels and increased expression of histone variant genes, suggesting concerted epigenetic changes after separation from the hexaploid."

The Aegilops ventricosa 2N v S translocation segment has been utilized in breeding disease-resistant wheat crops since the early 1990s. This segment is known to possess several important resistance genes against multiple wheat diseases including root knot nematode, stripe rust, leaf rust and stem rust. More recently, this segment has been associated with resistance to wheat blast, an emerging and devastating wheat disease in South America and Asia. To date, full characterization of the segment including its size, gene content and its association with grain yield is lacking. Here, we present a complete cytological and physical characterization of this agronomically important translocation in bread wheat. We de novo assembled the 2N v S segment in two wheat varieties, 'Jagger' and 'CDC Stanley,' and delineated the segment to be approximately 33 Mb. A total of 535 high-confidence genes were annotated within the 2N v S region, with > 10% belonging to the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) gene families. Identification of groups of NLR genes that are potentially N genome-specific and expressed in specific tissues can fast-track testing of candidate genes playing roles in various disease resistances. We also show the increasing frequency of 2N v S among spring and winter wheat breeding programs over two and a half decades, and the positive impact of 2N v S on wheat grain yield based on historical datasets. The significance of the 2N v S segment in wheat breeding due to resistance to multiple diseases and a positive impact on yield highlights the importance of understanding and characterizing the wheat pan-genome for better insights into molecular breeding for wheat improvement."

"2907499","abstracttext","The nucleotide sequence of the wheat mitochondrial gene for subunit 6 (atp6) of the F1F0 ATPase complex has been determined. Unlike bacterial, chloroplast or animal/fungal mitochondrial atp6 counterparts, which encode proteins of about 230-270 amino acids, the wheat mitochondrial atp6 homologue comprises the latter part of an open reading frame (ORF) of 386 codons. The ATP6 protein may therefore by synthesized with a long N-terminal presequence. This is supported by the finding that the ORF is preceded by a conserved sequence block closely related to ones preceding several other actively transcribed wheat mitochondrial protein-coding genes. The fused upstream ORF is similar in length, but unrelated in sequence, to those preceding the maize and tobacco mitochondrial atp6 genes. In wheat, the atp6 gene is located on a recombinationally active repeated DNA element, whose length of 1.4 kb corresponds approximately to that of the atp6 mRNA. A comparison of the wheat and maize ATP6 sequences reveals unexpectedly high divergence in the region corresponding to the mature N-terminal domain and may reflect mitochondrial DNA rearrangements during atp6 gene evolution in monocotyledonous plants."

"9265734","abstracttext","The transformation technique in common wheat has already been established by using microprojectile bombardment and scutellar tissues of immature embryos. In this study, in vitro culture response of immature embryos and the production of transgenic wheat plants were examined in six common wheat cultivars, i.e., Chinese Spring, Akadaruma, Haruhikari, Shiroganekomugi, Norin 12, and Norin 61. In all genotypes, more than seven hundred immature embryos were bombarded with a plasmid containing a bialaphos-resistant gene under control of the rice actin 1 gene. (Act1) promoter. Although the transient expression of the reporter gene encoding beta-glucuronidase following the rice Act1 promoter was similar in five of the six cultivars tested, the frequency of stable transformation varied with the genotype. The frequency of transformation was the highest in Akadaruma and Norin 12 of the six wheat cultivars; independently transformed plants were produced from 1.4% and 1.7% of bombarded embryos, respectively. On the other hand, the immature embryos of Norin 61 and Shiroganekomugi showing low efficiency of in vitro culture generated no transgenic plants. This variation of the transformation frequency was generally caused by the difference in the in vitro culture response with the genotype, rather than the efficiency of the introduction of the transgene into wheat cells by particle bombardment."

The deduced amino acid sequence of TA-GSTZ1 as well as the exon:intron placement are more similar to the GSTs of the Zeta class than to the two wheat GSTs reported earlier. The pGST cDNA gene product expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography showed typical Zeta class GST and glutathione peroxidase activities. Sequence polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of TA-GSTZ1 gene in wheat has been discovered. In this study, an 89 bp sequence is present in the 3' UTR of TA-GSTZ1gene in 16 wheat cultivars but absent in the other five. Although the biological importance of this polymorphism is unknown, it can be useful as a genetic marker in wheat breeding."

"10654089","abstracttext","An alloplasmic wheat line with the cytoplasm of Aegilops crassa expresses photoperiod-sensitive cytoplasmic male sterility (PCMS). Southern- and Northern-hybridization analyses showed that this line contains alterations in both the gene structure and transcription patterns of the mitochondrial gene orf25. In this study, the nucleotide sequence around the orf25 gene of Ae. crassa (CR-orf25) and common wheat (AE-orf25) was determined, and we found that the upstream region of CR-orf25 had been replaced by that of rps7 of common wheat (AE-rps7) through recombination. A novel open reading frame (orf48) is present upstream of CR-orf25. In these three genes, transcription was initiated from the consensus promoter motif of plant mitochondrial genes located in the upstream regions. Processing enzymes in Ae. crassa and common wheat cleave the respective precursor mRNAs, namely CR-orf25 and AE-rps7, at sites similar to that of the premature mitochondrial 26S rRNA. In contrast, the precursor mRNA is not effectively processed at the target sequence of CR-orf25 in the alloplasmic wheat line. Because major transcripts of the euplasmic CR-orf25 and AE-rps7 genes would result in a truncated orf48 product, one possibility is that the orf48 protein might disturb mitochondrial function at a specific stage and hence affect the expression of the PCMS trait."
"12695326","articletitle","The organization and rate of evolution of wheat genomes are correlated with recombination rates along chromosome arms."
"12695326","abstracttext","Genes detected by wheat expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were mapped into chromosome bins delineated by breakpoints of 159 overlapping deletions. These data were used to assess the organizational and evolutionary aspects of wheat genomes. Relative gene density and recombination rate increased with the relative distance of a bin from the centromere. Single-gene loci present once in the wheat genomes were found predominantly in the proximal, low-recombination regions, while multigene loci tended to be more frequent in distal, high-recombination regions. One-quarter of all gene motifs within wheat genomes were represented by two or more duplicated loci (paralogous sets). For 40 such sets, ancestral loci and loci derived from them by duplication were identified. Loci derived by duplication were most frequently located in distal, high-recombination chromosome regions whereas ancestral loci were most frequently located proximal to them. It is suggested that recombination has played a central role in the evolution of wheat genome structure and that gradients of recombination rates along chromosome arms promote more rapid rates of genome evolution in distal, high-recombination regions than in proximal, low-recombination regions."

"15138689","abstracttext","The greenbug, Schizaphis graminum (Rondani), is one of the major pests of wheat worldwide. The efficient utilization of wheat genes expressing resistance to greenbug infestation is highly dependent on a clear understanding of their relationships. The use of such genes will be further facilitated through the use of molecular markers linked to resistance genes. The present study involved several F(2) wheat populations derived from crosses between susceptible cultivars and resistant germplasm carrying different greenbug resistance genes. These populations were used to characterize the inheritance of a wheat gene ( Gbz) conferring tolerance to greenbug biotype I, to identify molecular markers linked to Gbz, and to investigate the relationship between Gbz and Gb3, a previously identified greenbug resistance gene. Our results indicated that Gbz is inherited as a single dominant gene. Microsatellite marker Xwmc157 is completely linked to Gbz, and Xbarc53 and Xgdm46 flank Gbz at distances of 5.1 and 9.5 cM, respectively. Selection of Gbz using marker Xwmc157 alone gives breeders 100% selection accuracy. Gbz may be placed in the distal region of the long arm of the wheat chromosome 7D. The results of allelism tests indicated that Gbz is either allelic or tightly linked to Gb3."

"16453565","abstracttext","We have determined the sequence of the wheat mitochondrial gene for cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COII) and find that its derived protein sequence differs from that of maize at only three amino acid positions. Unexpectedly, all three replacements are non-conservative ones. The wheat COII gene has a highly-conserved intron at the same position as in maize, but the wheat intron is 1.5 times longer because of an insert relative to its maize counterpart. Hybridization analysis of mitochondrial DNA from rye, pea, broad bean and cucumber indicates strong sequence conservation of COII coding sequences among all these higher plants. However, only rye and maize mitochondrial DNA show homology with wheat COII intron sequences and rye alone with intron-insert sequences. We find that a sequence identical to the region of the 5' exon corresponding to the transmembrane domain of the COII protein is present at a second genomic location in wheat mitochondria. These variations in COII gene structure and size, as well as the presence of repeated COII sequences, illustrate at the DNA sequence level, factors which contribute to higher plant mitochondrial DNA diversity and complexity."

"17110988","abstracttext","The invertase enzyme family is responsible for carbohydrate metabolism in rice, perennial ryegrass, and wheat. Fructan molecules accumulate in cell vacuoles of perennial ryegrass and wheat and are associated with abiotic stress tolerance. High levels of amino acid similarity between the fructosyltransferases responsible for fructan accumulation indicates that they may have evolved from invertase-like ancestral genes. In this study, we have applied comparative genomics to determine the mechanisms that lead to the evolution of fructosytransferase and invertase genes in rice, perennial ryegrass, and wheat. Duplications and rearrangements have been inferred to generate variant forms of the rice invertases since divergence from a common grass progenitor. The occurrence of multiple copies of fructosyltransferase genes indicated that duplication events continued during evolution of the wheat and perennial ryegrass lineages. Further gene rearrangements were evident in perennial ryegrass genes, albeit at a reduced level compared with the rice invertases. Gene orthologs were largely static after duplication during evolution of the wheat lineage. This study details evolutionary events that contribute to fructosyltransferase and invertase gene variation in grasses."

Transgenic plants showed enhanced response to leaf rust in greenhouse and field. Comparative study of harvesting parameters showed significant differences between transgenic and control plants. These indexes were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in control plants than that in transgenic plants, which suggests that they are significantly affected by pinA gene and that the puroindoline a protein (PINA) can effectively inhibit in vivo the growth of fungal, and the transgenic tetraploid wheat can grow well in Hubei Province, Central China, where the tetraploid wheat varieties Luna and Venusia have poor yield due to their disease-sensitivity."

In this study, 40 wheat EST sequences located in the distal region of 7DL were explored to identify specific PCR markers for the Bdv2 region on the basis of the homoeologous relationship between wheat chromosome 7D and Th.intermedium chromosome 7Ai#1. Our results revealed 8 novel EST-PCR markers specific to the Bdv2 region, including 5 EST-STS markers of BE404744, BE498985, BE591497, BG606695 and BQ161842, and 3 EST-SSCP markers of BE404953, BG312663 and BE498985. These EST-PCR markers could distinguish Bdv2 from another BYDV-resistance gene located on Th.intermedium chromosome 2Ai-2. These specific bands for the Bdv2 region were further cloned and sequenced. The sequencing analysis indicated that the specific sequences for the Bdv2 region were highly homologous with the original wheat EST sequences that were used to design primers, and encode respectively a protein kinase, P450, centrin, transducin, and a hypothetical protein. This study created a starting point for eventual cloning of the Bdv2 gene and understanding the defense mechanism."

This study first reports on the molecular cloning, sequencing and expression profile of the gene encoding the wheat neutral ceramidase designated as Ta-CDase. A full length wheat Ta-CDase gene is obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) based on the sequence of the WSRC36 fragment from an incompatible suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) cDNA library of wheat leaves infected by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici. The open reading frame (ORF) of 2,839 nucleotides encodes a polypeptide of 785 amino acids with a predicted isoelectric point (pI) of 6.398. The protein conserved domain search indicates that the polypeptide contains the signature of ceramidase, signal peptide sequence and transmembrane region. A phylogenetic analysis reveals that a high degree of relatedness exists among wheat Ta-CDase and ceramidases from other plant species at the amino acid level, while its relationship to that of animals and pathogens is more distant. The expression profile of the Ta-CDase shows a very strong expression of transcripts only at 48 h post inoculation (hpi), while expression level is low at other time points. Southern blot analyses showed that Ta-CDase is a multi-copy gene and located on wheat chromosome 4D and 5A."

Integration of gfp gene in the plastome was identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and Southern blotting using gfp gene as a probe. Expression of GFP protein was examined by western blot. Three positive transformants were obtained and the Southern blot of partial fragment of atpB and rbcL (targeting site) probes verified that one of them was homoplasmic. Stable expression of GFP fluorescence was confirmed by confocal microscopy in the leaf tissues from T(1) progeny seedlings. PCR analysis of gfp gene also confirmed the inheritance of transgene in the T(1) progeny. These results strengthen the feasibility of wheat chloroplast transformation and also give a novel method for the introduction of important agronomic traits in wheat through chloroplast transformation."
"22140237","articletitle","Advances and remaining challenges in the transformation of barley and wheat."
"22140237","abstracttext","Highly efficient and cost-effective transformation technologies are essential for studying gene function in the major cereal crops, wheat and barley. Demand for efficient transformation systems to allow over-expression, or RNAi-mediated silencing of target genes, is greatly increasing. This is due to technology advances, such as rapid genome sequencing, enhancing the rate of gene discovery and thus leading to a large number of genes requiring functional analysis through transformation pipelines. Barley can be transformed at very high efficiency but the methods are genotype-dependent. Wheat is more difficult to transform, however, recent advances are also allowing the development of high-throughput transformation systems in wheat. For many gene function studies, barley can be used as a model for wheat due to its highly efficient transformation rates and smaller, less complex genome. An ideal transformation system needs to be extremely efficient, simple to perform, inexpensive, genotype-independent, and give the required expression of the transgene. Considerable progress has been made in enhancing transformation efficiencies, controlling transgene expression and in understanding and manipulating transgene insertion. However, a number of challenges still remain, one of the key ones being the development of genotype-independent transformation systems for wheat and barley."

MicroRNAs are fundamental regulatory genes of eukaryotic genomes, acting on several biological functions. Transcription accumulation of microRNAs has been studied using qRT-PCR, while no validated reference genes for microRNAs in wheat are available until now. In this study, nine previous reported housekeeping genes and ten wheat microRNAs were examined with regard to their use as normalizer and data was analyzed using geNorm and NormFind software. Expression stability of candidate inner reference genes was investigated in different conditions. After analysis of all the sample pools and samples after biotic and abiotic stress treatments, it was found that microRNAs had better expression stability than protein-coding genes, and mi167 and mi159 appeared to be the two most suitable reference genes in wheat. To confirm the stable expression of the putative reference genes in wheat, expression of mi171b of wheat was examined with inner reference genes mi167, mi159 and combination of mi157 and mi159 respectively. We provided evidence for that in order to get a more accurate result of gene expression, mi167 and mi159 should be used as inner reference gene for normalization together."

The transcription levels of the TaBTF3 gene, first isolated from wheat seedlings in our lab, were differentially regulated by diverse abiotic stresses and hormone treatments, including PEG-induced stress (20 % polyethylene glycol 6000), cold (4 °C), salt (100 mM NaCl), abscisic acid (100 μM), methyl jasmonate (50 μM), and salicylic acid (50 μM). Southern blot analysis indicated that, in the wheat genome, TaBTF3 is a multi-copy gene. Compared to BSMV-GFP-infected wheat plants (control), under freezing (-8 °C for 48 h) or drought stress (withholding water for 15 days) conditions, TaBTF3-silenced wheat plants showed lower survival rates, free proline content, and relative water content and higher relative electrical conductivity and water loss rate. These results suggest that silencing of the TaBTF3 gene may impair tolerance to freezing and drought stresses in wheat and that it may be involved in the response to abiotic stresses in higher plants."

"24201873","abstracttext","Fertile plants of wheat have been regenerated from protoplasts in several laboratories. The objective of this study was to develop a transformation system using protoplasts as target cells. Protoplasts were isolated from cell suspensions initiated from an anther-derived callus. The protoplasts were transformed by electroporation using pBARGUS or pBAS, both carrying the Basta resistance (BAR) gene. A total of 2,761 calli were produced from electroporation transformed protoplasts in 3 independent experiments. Six calli survived selective culture on 10 mg/l phosphinothricin (PPT), a concentration that completely inhibited the growth of non-transformed wheat callus. Five PPT resistant calli showed phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (PAT) activity, whereas the sixth probably was a mutant. The transformed wheat calli could tolerate PPT concentrations up to 2,560 mg/l. Southern blot analyses confirmed the integration of the BAR gene in wheat genomes. The integrated DNA sequence may have partially methylated and tandemly repeated at least once. These results demonstrate the production of stably transformed wheat calli by electroporation-mediated direct gene transfer into protoplasts."

"24232279","abstracttext","The hexaploid wheat line H-93-70 carries a gene (Pch-1) that has been transferred from the wild grass Aegilops ventricosa and confers a high degree of resistance to eyespot diesease, caused by the fungus Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides. Crosses of the resistant line H-93-70 with the susceptible wheat Pané 247 and with a 7D/7Ag wheat/Agropyron substitution line were carried out and F2 kernels were obtained. The kernels were cut transversally and the halves carrying the embryos were used for the resistance test, while the distal halves were used for genetic typing. Biochemical markers were used to discriminate whether the transferred Pch-1 gene was located in chromosome 7D, as is the case for a resistance factor present in ""Roazon"" wheat. In the crosses involving Pané 247, resistance was not associated with the 7D locus Pln, which determines sterol ester pattern (dominant allele in H-93-70). In the crosses with the 7D/7Ag substitution line, resistance was neither associated with protein NGE-11 (7D marker), nor alternatively inherited with respect to protein C-7 (7Ag marker). It is concluded that gene Pch-1 represents a different locus and is not an allele of the resistance factor in ""Roazon"" wheat."

"29389910","abstracttext","The homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) gene family, as plant-specific transcription factors, plays an important role in plant development and growth as well as in the response to diverse stresses. Although HD-Zip genes have been extensively studied in many plants, they had not yet been studied in wheat, especially those involved in response to abiotic stresses. In this study, 46 wheat HD-Zip genes were identified using a genome-wide search method. Phylogenetic analysis classified these genes into four groups, numbered 4, 5, 17 and 20 respectively. In total, only three genes with A, B and D homoeologous copies were identified. Furthermore, the gene interaction networks found that the TaHDZ genes played a critical role in the regulatory pathway of organ development and osmotic stress. Finally, the expression profiles of the wheat HD-Zips in different tissues and under various abiotic stresses were investigated using the available RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data and then validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to obtain the tissue-specific and stress-responsive candidates. This study systematically identifies the HD-Zip gene family in wheat at the genome-wide level, providing important candidates for further functional analysis and contributing to the better understanding of the molecular basis of development and stress tolerance in wheat."

"28382049","abstracttext","Tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-mediated virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) has been frequently used in dicots. Here we show that it can also be used in monocots, by presenting a system involving use of a novel infiltration solution (containing acetosyringone, cysteine, and Tween 20) that enables whole-plant level VIGS of (germinated) seeds in wheat and maize. Using the established system, phytoene desaturase ( PDS ) genes were successfully silenced, resulting in typical photo-bleaching symptoms in the leaves of treated wheat and maize. In addition, three wheat homoeoalleles of MLO , a key gene repressing defense responses to powdery mildew in wheat, were simultaneously silenced in susceptible wheat with this system, resulting in it becoming resistant to powdery mildew. The system has the advantages generally associated with TRV-mediated VIGS systems (e.g., high-efficiency, mild virus infection symptoms, and effectiveness in different organs). However, it also has the following further advantages: (germinated) seed-stage agroinfiltration; greater rapidity and convenience; whole-plant level gene silencing; adequately stable transformation; and suitability for studying functions of genes involved in seed germination and early plant development stages."

"28770336","abstracttext_main conclusion","Altered expression of the TaRSL2 gene was positively correlated with variation in root hair length during allopolyploid wheat evolution, and overexpression of TaRSL2 in Arabidopsis increases root hair length. Root hairs aid nutrient and water uptake and anchor the plant in the soil. Allopolyploid wheats display significant growth vigor in terms of root hair length compared to their diploid progenitors, but little is known about the molecular basis of variation in root hair length during wheat allopolyploidization. Here, we isolated three orthologs of the Arabidopsis root hair gene ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE SIX-LIKE 2 (AtRSL2) in allohexaploid wheat, designated TaRSL2-4A, TaRSL2-4B and TaRSL2-4D. The deduced polypeptides of these three TaRSL2 homoeologous genes shared high similarity, and a conserved basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain was present in their C-terminal regions. Notably, the expression of TaRSL2 was positively correlated with root hair length of wheat accessions with different ploidy levels. Moreover, ectopic overexpression of TaRSL2-4D in Arabidopsis could increase root hair length. We found that the transcript levels of TaRSL2 homoeologous genes dynamically changed during allopolyploid wheat evolution, implicating the complexity of the underlying molecular mechanism. Collectively, we propose that altered expression of the TaRSL2 gene contributed to variation in root hair length in allopolyploid wheats."

An effort was made to identify a putative ortholog of Hodeum vulgare Ids3 gene in hexaploid wheat. The protein structure of TaIDS3 was modeled using homology modeling and structural behavior of modeled structure was analyzed at 20 ns. The simulation trajectory using molecular dynamics simulation suggested the model to be stable with no large fluctuations in residues and local domain level RMSF values (< 2.4 Å). In addition, the ProFunc results also predict the functional similarity between the proteins of HvIDS3 and its wheat ortholog (TaIDS3). The TaIds3 gene was assigned to the telomeric region of chromosome arm 7AS which supports the results obtained through bioinformatics analysis. The relative expression analysis of TaIds3 indicated that the detectable expression of TaIds3 is induced after 5th day of Fe starvation and increases gradually up to 15th day, and thereafter, it decreases until 35th day of Fe-starvation. This reflects that Fe deficiency directly regulates the induction of TaIds3 in the roots of hexaploid wheat. The identification of HvIds3- like gene in wheat has opened up new opportunities to enhance the nutrient quality in wheat through biofortification program."

"29125785","abstracttext","Leaf rust (Puccinia triticina) is a major biotic stress affecting wheat yields worldwide. Host-plant resistance is the best method for controlling leaf rust. Aegilops speltoides is a good source of resistance against wheat rusts. To date, five Lr genes, Lr28, Lr35, Lr36, Lr47, and Lr51, have been transferred from Ae. speltoides to bread wheat. In Selection2427, a bread wheat introgresed line with Ae. speltoides as the donor parent, a dominant gene for leaf rust resistance was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 3B (LrS2427). None of the Lr genes introgressed from Ae. speltoides have been mapped to chromosome 3B. Since none of the designated seedling leaf rust resistance genes have been located on chromosome 3B, LrS2427 seems to be a novel gene. Selection2427 showed a unique property typical of gametocidal genes, that when crossed to other bread wheat cultivars, the F 1 showed partial pollen sterility and poor seed setting, whilst Selection2427 showed reasonable male and female fertility. Accidental co-transfer of gametocidal genes with LrS2427 may have occurred in Selection2427. Though LrS2427 did not show any segregation distortion and assorted independently of putative gametocidal gene(s), its utilization will be difficult due to the selfish behavior of gametocidal genes."

"32211008","abstracttext","Cross-kingdom RNA interference (RNAi) is a biological process allowing plants to transfer small regulatory RNAs to invading pathogens to trigger the silencing of target virulence genes. Transient assays in cereal powdery mildews suggest that silencing of one or two effectors could lead to near loss of virulence, but evidence from stable RNAi lines is lacking. We established transient host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) in wheat, and demonstrate that targeting an essential housekeeping gene in the wheat powdery mildew pathogen ( Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici ) results in significant reduction of virulence at an early stage of infection. We generated stable transgenic RNAi wheat lines encoding a HIGS construct simultaneously silencing three B.g. tritici effectors including SvrPm3 a 1/f1 , a virulence factor involved in the suppression of the Pm3 powdery mildew resistance gene. We show that all targeted effectors are effectively downregulated by HIGS, resulting in reduced fungal virulence on adult wheat plants. Our findings demonstrate that stable HIGS of effector genes can lead to quantitative gain of resistance without major pleiotropic effects in wheat."

However, the transcriptional level interactions of introduced alien genes in the wheat genetic background is rarely investigated. In this study, we report the genome-wide impacts of introgressed chromosomes derived from Ae. longissima on gene transcriptions of the wheat landrace Chinese Spring. RNA-seq analyses demonstrated 5.37% and 4.30% of the genes were significantly differentially expressed (DEGs) in CS-Ae. longissima disomic 3S l #2(3B) substitution line TA3575 and disomic 6S l #3 addition line TA7548, respectively when compared to CS. In addition, 561 DEGs, including 413 up-regulated and 148 down-regulated or not transcribed genes, were simultaneously impacted by introgressed chromosomes 3S l #2 and 6S l #3, which accounts for 41.25% of the DEGs in TA3575 and 38.79% in TA7548. Seventeen DEGs, annotated as R genes, were shared by both introgression lines carrying chromosomes 3S l #2 and 6S l #3, which confer resistance to powdery mildew. This study will benefit the understanding of the wheat gene responses as result of alien gene(s) or chromosome intogression and the plant defense response initiated by powdery mildew resistance genes in chromosomes 3S l #2 and 6S l #3."

"32391373","abstracttext","Ingestion of gluten proteins (gliadins and glutenins) from wheat, barley and rye can cause coeliac disease (CD) in genetically predisposed individuals. The only remedy is a strict and lifelong gluten-free diet. There is a growing desire for coeliac-safe, whole-grain wheat-based products, as consumption of whole-grain foods reduces the risk of chronic diseases. However, due to the large number of gluten genes and the complexity of the wheat genome, wheat that is coeliac-safe but retains baking quality cannot be produced by conventional breeding alone. CD is triggered by immunogenic epitopes, notably those present in α-, γ-, and ω-gliadins. RNA interference (RNAi) silencing has been used to down-regulate gliadin families. Recently, targeted gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9 has been applied to gliadins. These methods produce offspring with silenced, deleted, and/or edited gliadins, that overall may reduce the exposure of patients to CD epitopes. Here we review methods to efficiently screen and select the lines from gliadin gene editing programs for CD epitopes at the DNA and protein level, for baking quality, and ultimately in clinical trials. The application of gene editing for the production of coeliac-safe wheat is further considered within the context of food production and in view of current national and international regulatory frameworks."

"32371881","abstracttext","Wild wheat species Aegilops peregrina (U p U p S p S p ), harbours resistance to various diseases including leaf rust and stripe rust. Inheritance studies in a recombinant inbred line population of wheat-Ae. peregrina introgression line IL pau16061 revealed the transfer of a single major dominant gene conditioning all stage resistance, herein temporarily designated as LrAp. Genomic in situ hybridisation of IL pau16061, resistant and susceptible RILs with U- and S-genome DNA probes confirmed that the introgression with leaf rust resistance is from the U p genome of Ae. peregrina. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation using chromosome specific probes identified U p genome introgression to be on the long arm of wheat chromosome 6B. To genetically map LrAp, bulked segregant analysis was combined with resistance gene enrichment sequencing (MapRenSeq). Five nucleotide binding leucine-rich repeat contigs distinguished resistant and susceptible bulks and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from these contigs co-segregated with LrAp. All five RenSeq NB_ARC contigs showed identity with the long arm of wheat chromosome 6B confirming the introgression on 6BL which we propose is a compensating translocation from Ae. peregrina chromosome 6U p L due to homoeology between the alien and wheat chromosomes. The SNP markers developed in this study will aid in cloning and marker assisted gene pyramiding of LrAp."

PacBio SMRT sequencing yielded 51,570 high-quality isoforms from leaves of control sample of Zhoumai 18, encoded by 20,366 gene loci. In total, 73,695 transcript isoforms, corresponding to 23,039 genes, were identified from the freezing-treated leaves.

In the present study, a systematic in silico analysis of the wheat PLC gene family revealed a total of 26 wheat PLC genes ( TaPLC s). Phylogenetic and sequence alignment analyses divided the wheat PLC genes into 2 subfamilies, TaPI-PLC (containing the typical X, Y, and C2 domains) and TaNPC (containing a phosphatase domain). TaPLC expression patterns differed among tissues, organs, and under abiotic stress conditions. The transcript levels of 8 TaPLC genes were validated through qPCR analyses. Most of the TaPLC genes were sensitive to salt stress and were up-regulated rapidly, and some were sensitive to low temperatures and drought. Overexpression of TaPI-PLC1-2B significantly improved resistance to salt and drought stress in Arabidopsis , and the primary root of P1-OE was significantly longer than that of the wild type under stress conditions. Our results not only provide comprehensive information for understanding the PLC gene family in wheat, but can also provide a solid foundation for functional characterization of the wheat PLC gene family."

"30466195","abstracttext","Dwarfing and semi-dwarfing are important agronomic traits that have great potential for the improvement of wheat yields. Rht12, a dominant gibberellic acid (GA)-responsive dwarfing gene from the gamma-ray-induced wheat mutant Karcagi 522M7K, is located in the long arm of chromosome 5A, which is closely linked with the locus Xwmc410. Rht12 is likely an ideal gene for GA biosynthesis and deactivation research in common wheat. However, information on the Rht12 locus and sequence is lacking. In this study, Rht12 significantly shortened stem cell length and decreased GA biosynthetic components. Using bulked segregant RNA-Seq, wheat 660k single nucleotide polymorphism chip detection, and newly developed simple sequence repeat markers, Rht12 was mapped to a 11.21-Mb region at the terminal end of chromosome 5AL, and was found to be closely linked with the Xw5ac207SSR marker with a 10.73-Mb fragment deletion in all of the homologous dwarfing plants. Transcriptome analyses of the remaining 483-kb region showed significantly higher expression of the TraesCS5A01G543100 gene encoding the GA metabolic enzyme GA 2-β-dioxygenase in dwarfing plants than in high stalk plants, suggesting that Rht12 reduces plant height by activating TaGA2ox-A14.

"31469444","abstracttext","Awns, bristle-like structures extending from grass lemmas, provide protection against predators, contribute to photosynthesis and aid in grain dispersal. In wheat, selection of awns with minimal extension, termed awnletted, has occurred during domestication by way of loci that dominantly inhibit awn development, such as Tipped1 (B1), Tipped2 (B2), and Hooded (Hd). Here we identify and characterize the B1 gene. B1 was identified using bulked segregant RNA-sequencing of an F 2 durum wheat population and through deletion mapping of awned bread wheat mutants. Functional characterization was accomplished by gene overexpression while haplotype analyses assessed B1 polymorphisms and genetic variation. Located on chromosome 5A, B1 is a C2H2 zinc finger encoding gene with ethylene-responsive element binding factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motifs. Constitutive overexpression of B1 in awned wheat produced an awnletted phenotype with pleiotropic effects on plant height and fertility. Transcriptome analysis of B1 overexpression plants suggests a role as transcriptional repressor, putatively targeting pathways involved in cell proliferation. Haplotype analysis revealed a conserved B1 coding region with proximal polymorphisms and supported the contention that B1 is mainly responsible for awnletted wheats globally. B1, predominantly responsible for awn inhibition in wheat, encodes a C2H2 zinc finger protein with EAR motifs which putatively functions as a transcriptional repressor."

"6364144","abstracttext","We present here the nucleotide sequence of the small subunit (18S) rRNA gene from wheat mitochondria. Aside from five discrete variable domains, this gene and the analogous (16S) rRNA gene in Escherichia coli show essentially a one-to-one correspondence in their potential secondary structures, with regions accounting for 86% of the bacterial 16S rRNA having a strict secondary structure counterpart in the mitochondrial 18S rRNA. Primary sequence identity between the two rRNAs ranges from 73% to 85% (76% overall) within regions of conserved secondary structure. Within a smaller secondary structure core common to all small subunit rRNAs, the wheat mitochondrial sequence shares substantially more primary sequence identity with the E. coli (eubacterial) sequence (88%) than with the small subunit rRNA sequences of Halobacterium volcanii (an archaebacterium) (71%) or Xenopus laevis cytoplasm (61%). Moreover, the wheat mitochondrial sequence contains a very high proportion of certain lineage-specific residues that distinguish eubacterial/plastid 16S rRNAs from archaebacterial 16S and eukaryotic cytoplasmic 18S rRNAs. These data establish that the ancestry of the wheat mitochondrial 18S rRNA gene can be traced directly and specifically to the eubacterial primary kingdom, and the data provide compelling support for a relatively recent xenogenous (endosymbiotic) origin of plant mitochondria from eubacteria-like organisms."

The structures of the genes are very similar to each other and to the maize SU1 isoamylase gene and consist of 18 exons spread over approximately 7.5 kb. Southern analysis and fluorescent in situ hybridization showed the Ae. tauschii gene to be located in the proximal region of the short arm of chromosome 7D, thus showing synteny with the localization of the rice isoamylase gene on rice chromosome 8. Analysis of the expression pattern of wheat sugary isoamylase genes indicates that they are strongly expressed in the developing endosperm 6 days after flowering. Three distinct Sugary-type cDNA sequences were isolated from the wheat endosperm that are likely to correspond to the products of the three genomes. The deduced amino acid sequence of rice and wheat Sugary-type isoamylase is compared with other sequences available in the database and the results demonstrate that there are three types of isoamylase sequences in plants: those containing 18 exons (the Sugary-type isoamylase gene), those containing 21 exons, and those containing only 1 exon. It is possible that different combinations of isoamylase genes are expressed in different tissues."

"16094442","abstracttext","Pigmentation of wheat grain and coleoptile is controlled by the R gene on chromosomes of the homoeologous group 3 and the Rc gene on chromosomes of the homoeologous group 7, respectively. Each of these genes is inherited monogenically. The pigment of grain has been suggested to be a derivative of catechin-tannin and that of coleoptile to be anthocyanin. These polyphenol compounds are known to be synthesized through the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. We isolated 4 partial nucleotide sequences of the early flavonoid biosynthesis genes (CHS, CHI, F3H, and DFR) in wheat. The expression of these genes was examined in the developing grain of red-grained and white-grained wheat lines. CHS, CHI, F3H, and DFR were highly upregulated in the grain coat tissue of the red-grained lines, whereas there was no significant expression in the white-grained lines. These results indicate that the R gene is involved in the activation of the early flavonoid biosynthesis genes. As for coleoptile pigmentation, all 4 genes were expressed in the red coleoptile; however, DFR was not activated in the white coleoptile. The Rc gene appears to be involved in DFR expression. The possibility that wheat R and Rc genes might be transcription factors is discussed."

By utilizing this structural similarity to perform modified RNA fingerprinting and data mining, we identified 184 putative expressed R genes of wheat. These include 87 NB/LRR types, 16 receptor-like kinases, and 13 Pto-like kinases. The remaining were seven Hm1 and two Hs1(pro-1) homologs, 17 pathogenicity related, and 42 unique NB/kinases. About 76% of the expressed R-gene candidates were rare transcripts, including 42 novel sequences. Physical mapping of 121 candidate R-gene sequences using 339 deletion lines localized 310 loci to 26 chromosomal regions encompassing approximately 16% of the wheat genome. Five major R-gene clusters that spanned only approximately 3% of the wheat genome but contained approximately 47% of the candidate R genes were observed.

"16735750","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum strains responsible for causing the plant disease Fusarium head blight vary greatly in their ability to cause disease and produce mycotoxins on wheat. With the goal of understanding fungal gene expression related to pathogenicity, three cDNA libraries were created by suppression subtractive hybridization using wheat heads inoculated with a highly aggressive strain and either water or a less aggressive strain of this pathogen. Eighty-four fungal genes expressed during initial disease development were identified. The probable functions of 49 of these genes could be inferred by bioinformatic analysis. Thirty-five ESTs had no known homologues in current databases and were not identified by ab initio gene prediction methods. These ESTs from infected wheat heads probably represent F. graminearum genes that previously were not annotated. Four genes represented in one of these libraries were selected for targeted gene replacement, leading to the characterization of a two-component response regulator homologue involved in pathogenicity of the fungus. The mutants for this gene showed reduced sporulation and delayed spread of Fusarium head blight on wheat."

"20213512","abstracttext","Proteins encoded by the NAC gene family constitute one of the largest plant-specific transcription factors, which have been identified to play many important roles in both abiotic and biotic stress adaptation, as well as in plant development regulation. In the current paper, a full-length cDNA sequence of a novel wheat NAC gene, designated as TaNAC4, was isolated using in silico cloning and the reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) methods. TaNAC4 sharing high homology with rice OsNAC4 gene was predicted to encode a protein of 308 amino acid residues, which contained a plant-specific NAC domain in the N-terminus. Transient expression analysis indicated that the deduced TaNAC4 protein was localized in the nucleus of onion epidemical cells. Yeast one-hybrid assay revealed that the C-terminal region of the TaNAC4 protein had transcriptional activity. The expression of TaNAC4 was largely higher in the wheat seedling roots, than that in leaves and stems. TaNAC4 transcript in wheat leaves was induced by the infection of strip rust pathogen, and also by exogenous applied methyl jasmonate (MeJA), ABA and ethylene. However, salicylic acid (SA) had no obvious effect on TaNAC4 expression. Environmental stimuli, including high salinity, wounding, and low-temperature also induced TaNAC4 expression.

"22243838","abstracttext","Members of the Wheat-Induced Resistance 1 (TaWIR1) gene family are highly induced in response to a wide range of pathogens. Homologues have been identified in barley, but not in Brachypodium, whereas, in rice, only distant WIR1 candidates are known. Phylogenetic analysis placed TaWIR1a and TaWIR1b within a distinct clade of wheat transcripts, whereas TaWIR1c clustered with HvWIR1 genes. Transcripts of all three TaWIR1 genes were strongly induced by a wheat-adapted isolate of Magnaporthe oryzae. Virus-induced gene silencing of the TaWIR1 gene family had no effect on the initial penetration of epidermal cells by M. oryzae. However, following the establishment of an infection site, the fungus was able to grow more extensively within the leaf tissue, relative to control leaves, indicating a role for the TaWIR1 gene family in the cell-to-cell movement of M. oryzae. In contrast, the silencing of TaWIR1 transcripts had no effect on epidermal cell penetration by a wheat-adapted isolate of Blumeria graminis, or on the subsequent growth of hyphae. Differential transcription of TaWIR1 genes was also seen in epidermal peels, relative to the remaining leaf tissue, following inoculation with M. oryzae."

"22367644","abstracttext","Salt stress is a mixture of ionic, osmotic, and oxidative stresses. The expression of TaSOS1 (a transmembrane Na(+)/H(+) antiporter) and TaSOS4 [a cytoplasmic pyridoxal (PL) kinase] genes were measured in four different salinity levels and different time courses of salinity exposure using qRT-PCR technique. Mahuti (salt tolerant) and Alamut (salt sensitive) cultivars were used as cultivated wheat, and T. boeticum and Aegilops crassa as wild wheat plants. Salt-induced expression of TaSOS1 in these wild wheat plants indicates the presence of active TaSOS1 gene on the genomes A and D. The TaSOS1 and TaSOS4 transcript levels were found to be downregulated after salt treatment in all cultivars except in A. crassa, which was in contrast with its expression pattern in roots that was being upregulated from a very low-basal expression, after salt treatments. Duncan's Multiple Range Test showed a significant difference between expression in the 200-mM NaCl concentration with the 50 and 100 mM for the TaSOS1 gene, and no significant difference for TaSOS4. Lack of significant correlation between the TaSOS1 and TaSOS4 gene expressions confirms the theory that PLP has no significant effect on the expression of the TaSOS1 gene in wheat leaves."

"24312351","abstracttext","Glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) is a proposed regulator of plant defense signaling in basal resistance and systemic acquired resistance (SAR). The GLY1-encoded glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) and GLI1-encoded glycerol kinase (GK) are two key enzymes involved in the G3P biosynthesis in plants. However, their physiological importance in wheat defense against pathogens remains unclear. In this study, quantification analysis revealed that G3P levels were significantly induced in wheat leaves challenged by the avirulent Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) race CYR23. The transcriptional levels of TaGLY1 and TaGLI1 were likewise significantly induced by avirulent Pst infection. Furthermore, knocking down TaGLY1 and TaGLI1 individually or simultaneously with barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing (BSMV-VIGS) inhibited G3P accumulation and compromised the resistance in the wheat cultivar Suwon 11, whereas the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and the expression of the SA-induced marker gene TaPR1 in plant leaves were altered significantly after gene silencing. These results suggested that G3P contributes to wheat systemic acquired resistance (SAR) against stripe rust, and provided evidence that the G3P function as a signaling molecule is conserved in dicots and monocots. Meanwhile, the simultaneous co-silencing of multiple genes by the VIGS system proved to be a powerful tool for multi-gene functional analysis in plants."

Infection by Z. tritici is characterized by its extended latent period, which typically lasts 2 wks, and is followed by extensive host cell death, and rapid proliferation of fungal biomass. This work characterizes the level of genomic variation in 13 isolates, for which we have measured virulence on 11 wheat cultivars with differential resistance genes. Between the reference isolate, IPO323, and the 13 Australian isolates we identified over 800,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms, of which ∼10% had an effect on the coding regions of the genome. Furthermore, we identified over 1700 probable presence/absence polymorphisms in genes across the Australian isolates using de novo assembly. Finally, we developed a gene tree sorting method that quickly identifies groups of isolates within a single gene alignment whose sequence haplotypes correspond with virulence scores on a single wheat cultivar. Using this method, we have identified < 100 candidate effector genes whose gene sequence correlates with virulence toward a wheat cultivar carrying a major resistance gene."

"27857194","abstracttext","Wheat is recalcitrant to genetic transformation. A potential solution is to manipulate the expression of some host proteins involved in T-DNA integration process. VirE2 interacting protein 2 (VIP2) plays an important role in T-DNA transport and integration. In this study, a TaVIP2 gene was cloned from common wheat. Southern blot and allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) combined with an online chromosomal location software tool revealed that three TaVIP2 genes were located on wheat chromosomes 1AL, 1BL, and 1DL. These three homoeoallelic TaVIP2 genes all contained 13 exons and 12 introns, and their coding sequences were the same; there were a few single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among the three genes. The heterologous expression of the TaVIP2 gene in tobacco led to enhancement of the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation efficiency up to 2.5-fold. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing TaVIP2 showed enhanced resistance to powdery mildew. Further quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that overexpression of TaVIP2 in transgenic tobacco up-regulated the expression of an endogenous gene, NtPR-1, which likely contributed to powdery mildew resistance in transgenic tobacco. Our study indicates that the TaVIP2 gene may be highly useful in efforts to improve Agrobacterium-mediated transformation efficiency and to enhance powdery mildew resistance in wheat."

"28098486","abstracttext","Gene loss during the formation of hexaploid bread wheat has been repeatedly reported. However, our knowledge on genome-wide analysis of the genes present on a single subgenome (SSG) in bread wheat is still limited. In this study, by analysing the 'Chinese Spring' chromosome arm shotgun sequences together with high-confidence gene models, we detected 433 genes on a SSG. Greater gene loss was observed in A and D subgenomes compared with B subgenome. More than 79% of the orthologs for these SSG genes were detected in diploid and tetraploid relatives of hexaploid wheat. Unexpectedly, no bias in expression breadth or in the distribution patterns of GO (gene ontology) terms for these genes was detected among the high-confidence genes. Further, network and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analyses indicated that most of these genes were not functionally related to each other. Interestingly, 30.7% of these SSG genes were most highly expressed in root, showing biased distribution given the distribution of the whole high-confidence genes. Collectively, these results facilitate our understanding of the loss of the genes that were retained in a SSG during the formation of hexaploid wheat."

We subjected a 272-sample spelt-bread wheat set to several potential diagnostic methods. DNA markers for γ-gliadin-D ( GAG56D), γ-gliadin-B ( GAG56B), and the Q-gene were used, alongside phenotypic assessment of ease-of-threshing and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The GAG56B and GAG56D markers demonstrated low diagnostic power in comparison to the Q-gene genotyping, which showed full accordance with the threshing phenotype, providing a highly accurate distinction between bread wheat and spelt kernels. A highly reliable Q classification was based on a three-waveband NIR model [Kappa (0.97), R-square (0.93)], which suggested that this gene influences grain characteristics. Our data ruled out a protein concentration bias of the NIRS-based diagnosis. These findings highlight the Q gene and NIRS as important, valuable, but simple tools for distinguishing between bread wheat and spelt."

Host resistance represents the most effective approach to limit disease damages; however, only a limited number of resistant loci have currently been detected in durum genotypes. In this work we report the map-based cloning of a FHB-QTL on 2A chromosome of durum wheat, introgressed from a resistant line derived from the Chinese wheat cv. Sumai-3. A marker enrichment of the QTL region was carried out leading to the inclusion of 27 new SNPs respect to the previous map. A wall-associated receptor-like kinase (WAK2) gene was identified in the region and sequenced, in the resistant parent ( R P) one gene was predicted accounting for a genomic sequence of 5,613 structured into 6 exons, whereas two adjacent genes were predicted on the same DNA plus strand of the susceptible parent ( S P).t The involvement of WAK2 gene in FHB resistance mechanism was assessed by gene expression comparison between resistant and susceptible wheat lines, and disease symptoms evaluation in 3 TILLING mutants for WAK protein function."

In wheat, several TaHSP101/CLPB genes were identified, but have not been comprehensively characterized. Given the complexity of a polyploid genome with its phenomena of homoeologous expression bias, detailed analysis on the whole TaCLPB family members is important to understand the genetic basis of heat tolerance in hexaploid wheat. In this study, a genome-wide analysis revealed thirteen members of TaCLPB gene family and their expression patterns in various tissues, developmental stages, and stress conditions. Detailed characterization of TaCLPB gene and protein structures suggested potential variations of the sub-cellular localization and their functional regulations. We revealed homoeologous specific variations among TaCLPB gene copies that have not been reported earlier. A study of the Chromosome 1 TaCLPB in four wheat genotypes demonstrated unique patterns of the homoeologous gene expression under moderate and extreme heat treatments. The results give insight into the strategies to improve heat tolerance by targeting one or some of the TaCLPB genes in wheat."

"31297694","abstracttext","Internal reference genes that are stably expressed are essential for normalization in comparative expression analyses. However, gene expression varies significantly among species, organisms, tissues, developmental stages, stresses, and treatments. Therefore, identification of stably expressed reference genes in developmental endosperm of bread wheat is important for expression analysis of endosperm genes. As the first study to systematically screen for reference genes across different developmental stages of wheat endosperm, nine genes were selected from among 76 relatively stable genes based on high-throughput RNA sequencing data. The expression stability of these candidate genes and five traditional reference genes was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR combined with three independent algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. The results showed that ATG8d was the most stable gene during wheat endosperm development, followed by Ta54227, while the housekeeping gene GAPDH, commonly used as an internal reference, was the least stable. ATG8d and Ta54227 together formed the optimal combination of reference genes. Comparative expression analysis of glutenin genes indicated that credible quantification could be achieved by normalization against ATG8d in developmental endosperm. The stably expressed gene characterized here can act as a proper internal reference for expression analysis of wheat endosperm genes, especially nutrient- and nutrient synthesis-related genes."

"30342465","abstracttext_background","Salinity severely limits wheat production in many parts of the world. Development of salt tolerant varieties represents the most practical option for enhancing wheat production from these areas. Application of marker assisted selection may assist in fast tracking development of salt tolerant wheat varieties. However, SSR markers available in the public domain are not specifically targeted to functional regions of wheat genome, therefore large numbers of these need to be analysed for identification of markers associated with traits of interest. With the availability of a fully annotated wheat genome assembly, it is possible to develop SSR markers specifically targeted to genic regions. We performed extensive analysis to identify candidate gene based SSRs and assessed their utility in characterizing molecular diversity in a panel of wheat genotypes."
"30342465","abstracttext_results","Our analysis revealed, 161 SSR motifs in 94 salt tolerance candidate genes of wheat. These SSR motifs were nearly equally distributed on the three wheat sub-genomes; 29.8% in A, 35.7% in B and 34.4% in D sub-genome. The maximum number of SSR motifs was present in exons (31.1%) followed by promoters (29.8%), 5'UTRs (21.1%), introns (14.3%) and 3'UTRs (3.7%). Out of the 65 candidate gene based SSR markers selected for validation, 30 were found polymorphic based on initial screening and employed for characterizing genetic diversity in a panel of wheat genotypes including salt tolerant and susceptible lines. These markers generated an average of 2.83 alleles/locus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clusters. Salt susceptible genotypes were mainly represented in clusters I and III, whereas high and moderate salt tolerant genotypes were distributed in the remaining two clusters. Population structure analysis revealed two sub-populations, sub-population 1 contained the majority of salt tolerant whereas sub-population 2 contained majority of susceptible genotypes. Moreover, we observed reasonably higher transferability of SSR markers to related wheat species."

"18185910","abstracttext","Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are crucial sensors of calcium concentration changes in plant cells under diverse endogenous and environmental stimuli. We identified 20 CDPK genes from bread wheat and performed a comprehensive study on their structural, functional and evolutionary characteristics. Full-length cDNA sequences of 14 CDPKs were obtained using various approaches. Wheat CDPKs were found to be similar to their counterparts in rice in genomic structure, GC content, subcellular localization, and subgroup classification. Divergence time estimation of wheat CDPK gene pairs and wheat-rice orthologs suggested that most duplicated genes already existed in the common ancestor of wheat and rice. The number of CDPKs in diploid wheat genome was estimated to be at least 26, a number close to that in rice, Arabidopsis, and poplar. However, polymorphism among EST sequences uncovered transcripts of all three homoeologous alleles for 13 out of 20 CDPKs. Thus, the hexaploid wheat should have 2-3 fold more CDPK genes expressing in their cells than the diploid species. Wheat CDPK genes were found to respond to various biotic and abiotic stimuli, including cold, hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), salt, drought, powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis tritici, Bgt), as well as phytohormones abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellic acid (GA). Each CDPK gene often responded to multiple treatments, suggesting that wheat CDPKs are converging points for multiple signal transduction pathways. The current work represents the first comprehensive study of CDPK genes in bread wheat and provides a foundation for further functional study of this important gene family in Triticeae."

"26563345","abstracttext_key message","A strong, stable and root-specific expression system was developed from a rice root-specific GLYCINE - RICH PROTEIN 7 promoter for use as an enabling technology for genetic manipulation of wheat root traits. Root systems play an important role in wheat productivity. Genetic manipulation of wheat root traits often requires a root-specific or root-predominant expression system as an essential enabling technology. In this study, we investigated promoters from rice root-specific or root-predominant expressed genes for development of a root expression system in bread wheat. Transient expression analysis using a GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN (GFP) reporter gene driven by rice promoters identified six promoters that were strongly expressed in wheat roots. Extensive organ specificity analysis of three rice promoters in transgenic wheat revealed that the promoter of rice GLYCINE-RICH PROTEIN 7 (OsGRP7) gene conferred a root-specific expression pattern in wheat. Strong GFP fluorescence in the seminal and branch roots of wheat expressing GFP reporter driven by the OsGRP7 promoter was detected in epidermal, cortical and endodermal cells in mature parts of the root. The GFP reporter driven by the promoter of rice METALLOTHIONEIN-LIKE PROTEIN 1 (OsMTL1) gene was mainly expressed in the roots with essentially no expression in the leaf, stem or seed. However, it was also expressed in floral organs including glume, lemma, palea and awn. In contrast, strong expression of rice RCg2 promoter-driven GFP was found in many tissues. The GFP expression driven by these three rice promoters was stable in transgenic wheat plants through three generations (T1-T3) examined. These data suggest that the OsGRP7 promoter can provide a strong, stable and root-specific expression system for use as an enabling technology for genetic manipulation of wheat root traits."

"30562998","abstracttext","The domestication and subsequent genetic improvement of wheat led to the development of large-seeded cultivated wheat species relative to their smaller-seeded wild progenitors. While increased grain weight (GW) continues to be an important goal of many wheat breeding programs, few genes underlying this trait have been identified despite an abundance of studies reporting quantitative trait loci (QTL) for GW. Here we perform a QTL analysis for GW using a population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross between wild emmer wheat accession 'Zavitan' and durum wheat variety 'Svevo'. Identified QTLs in this population were anchored to the recent Zavitan reference genome, along with previously published QTLs for GW in tetraploid wheat. This genome-based, meta-QTL analysis enabled the identification of a locus on chromosome 6A whose introgression from wild wheat positively affects GW. The locus was validated using an introgression line carrying the 6A GW QTL region from Zavitan in a Svevo background, resulting in >8% increase in GW compared to Svevo. Using the reference sequence for the 6A QTL region, we identified a wheat ortholog to OsGRF4, a rice gene previously associated with GW. The coding sequence of this gene (TtGRF4-A) contains four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between Zavitan and Svevo, one of which reveals the Zavitan allele to be rare in a core collection of wild emmer and completely absent from the domesticated emmer genepool. Similarly, another wild emmer accession (G18-16) was found to carry a rare allele of TtGRF4-A that also positively affects GW and is characterized by a unique SNP absent from the entire core collection. These results exemplify the rich genetic diversity of wild wheat, posit TtGRF4-A as a candidate gene underlying the 6A GW QTL, and suggest that the natural Zavitan and G18-16 alleles of TtGRF4-A have potential to increase wheat yields in breeding programs."

"30673804","abstracttext_key message","Recent technological advances in wheat genomics provide new opportunities to uncover genetic variation in traits of breeding interest and enable genome-based breeding to deliver wheat cultivars for the projected food requirements for 2050. There has been tremendous progress in development of whole-genome sequencing resources in wheat and its progenitor species during the last 5 years. High-throughput genotyping is now possible in wheat not only for routine gene introgression but also for high-density genome-wide genotyping. This is a major transition phase to enable genome-based breeding to achieve progressive genetic gains to parallel to projected wheat production demands. These advances have intrigued wheat researchers to practice less pursued analytical approaches which were not practiced due to the short history of genome sequence availability. Such approaches have been successful in gene discovery and breeding applications in other crops and animals for which genome sequences have been available for much longer. These strategies include, (i) environmental genome-wide association studies in wheat genetic resources stored in genbanks to identify genes for local adaptation by using agroclimatic traits as phenotypes, (ii) haplotype-based analyses to improve the statistical power and resolution of genomic selection and gene mapping experiments, (iii) new breeding strategies for genome-based prediction of heterosis patterns in wheat, and (iv) ultimate use of genomics information to develop more efficient and robust genome-wide genotyping platforms to precisely predict higher yield potential and stability with greater precision.

The results indicated that labelled chromosomes of rye and unlabelled chromosomes of wheat could be observed throughout all meiotic stages in the triticale. For Kavkaz wheat, the presence of the translocated 1RS chromosome arm of rye was detected at the interphase or very early prophase stage. Rapid assessment of feasibility of gene transfers and detection of alien DNA in somatic cells at the interphase stage by in situ hybridization allows for rapid decision-making and saves time and expense in plant breeding programs."

Within these regions there are no sequence motifs similar to those shown to be important for light-regulated expression in other species. The binding activity was not detected in wheat root nuclear extracts, or in pea leaf extracts. There was a higher level of binding activity in light-grown than in dark-grown wheat leaves. The level was also found to decline when light-grown plants were given an extended dark treatment, but could be reinduced by light. Utilising the gradient of developmental maturity which exists within the wheat leaf it was found that WF-1 activity increases during leaf development."

Using a saturating amount of RuFae2 for 100 mg substrate, a maximum of 18.7 and 80.0 μg FA was released from 100 mg corn fiber and wheat-insoluble arabinoxylan, respectively. Addition of GH10 endoxylanase (EX) synergistically increased the release of FA with the highest level of 6.7-fold for wheat bran. The synergistic effect of adding GH11 EX was significantly smaller with all the substrates tested. The difference in the effect of the two EXs was further analyzed by comparing the rate in the release of FA with increasing EX concentration using wheat-insoluble arabinoxylan as the substrate."

The importance of lodicule swelling in assuring non-cleistogamous flowering in a range of wild and domesticated wheat accessions of varying ploidy level was established. Re-sequencing of wheat AP2 homoeologous genes was carried out to identify natural variation at both the nucleotide and polypeptide level. The sequences of wheat AP2 homoeologs are highly conserved even across different ploidy levels and no functional variants at the key miR172 targeting site were detected. These results indicate that engineering of cleistogamous wheat will require the presence of a functional TaAP2 modification at each of the three homoeologs."

Contrasted evolutionary plasticity is observed where the B subgenome appears more sensitive (i.e. plastic) in contrast to A as dominant (i.e. stable) in response to the neotetraploidization and D subgenome as supra-dominant (i.e. pivotal) in response to the neohexaploidization event.

This chapter focuses on the use of introns and flexible polypeptide linkers to foster the expression of a split-barnase expression system in plants. The methods and protocols that were employed with the objective to test the effects of such genetic elements on transgene expression and to find the optimal design of expression vectors for use in wheat are provided. Split-inteins can be used to form an agriculturally important trait (male sterility) in wheat plants. The use of this principle for the production of hybrid wheat seed is described. The suggested toolbox will hopefully be a valuable contribution to future optimization strategies in this commercially important crop."

"29131854","abstracttext","The germplasm collection of 87 wheat-wheatgrass hybrids developed in Tsitisin Main Botanical Garden (Russia, Moscow) was evaluated for resistance to pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) by spike sprouting (SS) and germination index (GI) assays as well as for spike and grain features. The PHS resistance variation and haplotype polymorphism of the wheatgrass ThVp-1 and wheat TaVp-1B genes orthologues of Vp-1 was revealed in the studied collection. Four haplotypes of ThVp-1 were revealed: ThVp-1a (41% of the entries), ThVp-1b (13%), ThVp-1c (29%), and ThVp-1d (15%). The association between the allelic state of ThVp-1 and PHS resistance in the wheat-wheatgrass hybrids was shown: haplotype ThVp-1d of the wheatgrass Vp-1 gene is significantly associated with reduced PHS in the wheat-wheatgrass hybrids (mean SS 0.33, mean GI 0.64). The resistant entries may be perspective as a source of PHS resistance in the development of commercial cultivars of perennial wheat."

"30962619","abstracttext","The domestication of wild emmer wheat led to the selection of modern durum wheat, grown mainly for pasta production. We describe the 10.45 gigabase (Gb) assembly of the genome of durum wheat cultivar Svevo. The assembly enabled genome-wide genetic diversity analyses revealing the changes imposed by thousands of years of empirical selection and breeding. Regions exhibiting strong signatures of genetic divergence associated with domestication and breeding were widespread in the genome with several major diversity losses in the pericentromeric regions. A locus on chromosome 5B carries a gene encoding a metal transporter (TdHMA3-B1) with a non-functional variant causing high accumulation of cadmium in grain. The high-cadmium allele, widespread among durum cultivars but undetected in wild emmer accessions, increased in frequency from domesticated emmer to modern durum wheat. The rapid cloning of TdHMA3-B1 rescues a wild beneficial allele and demonstrates the practical use of the Svevo genome for wheat improvement."

"30115782","abstracttext","The coordinated expression of highly related homoeologous genes in polyploid species underlies the phenotypes of many of the world's major crops. Here we combine extensive gene expression datasets to produce a comprehensive, genome-wide analysis of homoeolog expression patterns in hexaploid bread wheat. Bias in homoeolog expression varies between tissues, with ~30% of wheat homoeologs showing nonbalanced expression. We found expression asymmetries along wheat chromosomes, with homoeologs showing the largest inter-tissue, inter-cultivar, and coding sequence variation, most often located in high-recombination distal ends of chromosomes. These transcriptionally dynamic genes potentially represent the first steps toward neo- or subfunctionalization of wheat homoeologs. Coexpression networks reveal extensive coordination of homoeologs throughout development and, alongside a detailed expression atlas, provide a framework to target candidate genes underpinning agronomic traits in wheat."

"30149791","abstracttext","The gene pool of wheat and its wild and domesticated relatives contains a plethora of resistance genes that can be exploited to make wheat more resilient to pathogens. Only a few of these genes have been isolated and studied at the molecular level. In recent years, we have seen a shift from classical breeding to genomics-assisted breeding, which makes use of the enormous advancements in DNA sequencing and high-throughput molecular marker technologies for wheat improvement. These genomic advancements have the potential to transform wheat breeding in the near future and to significantly increase the speed and precision at which new cultivars can be bred. This review highlights the genomic improvements that have been made in wheat and its pathogens over the past years and discusses their implications for disease-resistance breeding."

"30656492","abstracttext","Wheat is the most widely grown cereal grain, occupying a significant portion of the total cultivated land. As drought is the major environmental stressor affecting crop production, yield maintenance under water deficit conditions appears as a highly desirable phenotype for crop improvement. The HaHB4 (Helianthus annuus homeobox 4) gene from sunflower encodes for a transcription factor involved in tolerance to environmental stress. The introduction of HaHB4 in wheat led to the development of event IND-ØØ412-7 (HB4 ® wheat), which displayed higher yield in production environments of low productivity potential. Compositional analysis of IND-ØØ412-7 wheat, including 41 nutrients and 2 anti-nutrients for grain and 10 nutrients in forage, was performed. Results of these studies indicated that IND-ØØ412-7 is compositionally equivalent to non-transgenic wheat."

"33046875","abstracttext","The potential of genome editing to improve the agronomic performance of crops is often limited by low plant regeneration efficiencies and few transformable genotypes. Here, we show that expression of a fusion protein combining wheat GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR 4 (GRF4) and its cofactor GRF-INTERACTING FACTOR 1 (GIF1) substantially increases the efficiency and speed of regeneration in wheat, triticale and rice and increases the number of transformable wheat genotypes. GRF4-GIF1 transgenic plants were fertile and without obvious developmental defects. Moreover, GRF4-GIF1 induced efficient wheat regeneration in the absence of exogenous cytokinins, which facilitates selection of transgenic plants without selectable markers. We also combined GRF4-GIF1 with CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and generated 30 edited wheat plants with disruptions in the gene Q (AP2L-A5). Finally, we show that a dicot GRF-GIF chimera improves regeneration efficiency in citrus, suggesting that this strategy can be applied to dicot crops."

"7599651","abstracttext","Osem, a rice gene homologous to the wheat Em gene, which encodes one of the late-embryogenesis abundant proteins was isolated. The gene was characterized with respect to control of transcription by abscisic acid (ABA) and the transcriptional activator VP1, which is involved in the ABA-regulated gene expression during late embryo-genesis. A fusion gene (Osem-GUS) consisting of the Osem promoter and the bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene was constructed and tested in a transient expression system, using protoplasts derived from a suspension-cultured line of rice cells, for activation by ABA and by co-transfection with an expression vector (35S-Osvp1) for the rice VP1 (OSVP1) cDNA. The expression of Osem-GUS was strongly (40- to 150-fold) activated by externally applied ABA and by over-expression of (OS)VP1. The Osem promoter has three ACGTG-containing sequences, motif A, motif B and motif A', which resemble the abscisic acid-responsive element (ABRE) that was previously identified in the wheat Em and the rice Rab16. There is also a CATGCATG sequence, which is known as the Sph box and is shown to be essential for the regulation by VP1 of the maize anthocyanin regulatory gene C1. Focusing on these sequence elements, various mutant derivatives of the Osem promoter in the transient expression system were assayed. The analysis revealed that motif A functions not only as an ABRE but also as a sequence element required for the regulation by (OS)VP1."

"8790290","abstracttext","Isolation of cDNAs encoding individual members of a gene family is essential for assessing their role in a biological phenomenon. However, this process is often laborious and slow due to highly conserved protein-coding region that interferes with the isolation of the individual members. Identification of gene-specific probes from 3' non-coding regions of different members can assist in the fast retrieval and characterization of individual members of a multigene family. We used the recent technique of differential display for the same purpose. As an example of a multigene family in plants, we selected a heat shock protein gene family, HSP16.9 from wheat, with estimated 12 members. We modified the original differential display technique for selective amplification of the 3' non-coding regions of different wheat HSP16.9 genes by replacing the random 10-mer in the original method with a conserved HSP16.9 gene family-specific primer. Sixteen cDNA fragments from these experiments were sequenced and they represent 8 different members of a 12 member gene family. Our success can be attributed to shorter 3' non-coding regions that are typical of higher-plant genes and use of highly conserved gene family-specific primer in these experiments. This modified differential display technique can be of general application to other plant systems where cloning of the different members of a gene family is desired."

"10659792","abstracttext","To investigate the excision of a maize transposable element in wheat cells, plasmid DNAs containing a Dissociation (Ds) element located between a rice actin 1 gene promoter and a beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene (gus) were introduced into wheat callus lines by microprojectile bombardment, and transient GUS expression was assayed. The gus-expressing cells after Ds excision were detected only when the Activator (Ac) transposase gene was co-transformed. To further examine a relationship between the amount of Ac mRNA and the Ds excision frequency, the Ds-containing plasmids were introduced into 15 independent transgenic callus lines transformed with the Ac transposase gene. Ten lines expressed the Ac transposase gene under the control of either the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter or the Ac native promoter. The gus gene expression that indicated the Ds excision was observed only in the transgenic callus lines stably expressing the Ac transposase gene. The number of blue spots reflecting the frequency of Ds excision was variable among them. Northern-blot analysis also showed a large variability in the amount of Ac transposase transcripts among the lines. It was however noted that the excision frequency was decreased at a high level of the Ac transposase transcripts, supporting the hypothesis that Ds excision is inhibited above a certain level of the Ac transposase as observed in maize and transgenic tobacco."

"12416630","abstracttext","Vast differences exist in genome sizes of higher plants; however, gene count remains relatively constant among species. Differences observed in DNA content can be attributed to retroelement amplification leading to genome expansion. Cytological and genetic studies have demonstrated that genes are clustered in islands rather than distributed at random in the genome. Analysis of gene islands within highly repetitive genomes of plants like wheat remains largely unstudied. The objective of our work was to sequence and characterize a contiguous DNA sequence from chromosome IDS of Aegilops tauschii. An RFLP probe that maps to the Lr21 region of IDS was used to isolate a single BAC. The BAC was sequenced and is 106 kb in length. The contiguous DNA sequence contains a 46-kb retroelement-free gene island containing seven coding sequences. Within the gene island is a complex arrangement of resistance and defense response genes. Overall gene density in this BAC is 1 gene per 8.9 kb. This report demonstrates that wheat and its relatives do contain regions with gene densities similar to that of Arabidopsis."

"12590346","abstracttext","Homoeologous group 1 chromosomes of wheat contain important genes that confer resistance to leaf, stem and stripe rusts, powdery mildew and Russian wheat aphid. A disease resistance gene analog encoding nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR), designated RgaYr10, was previously identified at the stripe rust resistant locus, Yr10, located on chromosome 1BS distal to the storage protein, Gli-B1locus. RgaYr10 identified gene members in the homoeologous region of chromosome 1DS cosegregating with the leaf rust resistance gene, Lr21, which originally was transferred from a diploid D genome progenitor. Four RgaYr10 gene members were isolated from chromosome 1DS and compared to two gene members previously isolated from the chromosome 1BS homeologue. NBS-LRR genes tightly linked to stripe rust resistance gene Yr10 on chromosome 1BS were closely related in sequence and structure to NBS-LRR genes tightly linked to leaf rust resistance gene Lr21 located within the homoeologous region on chromosome 1DS. The level of sequence homology was similar between NBS-LRR genes that were isolated from different genomes as compared to genes from the same genome."

"20857096","abstracttext","A total of 17 culturable nitrogen-fixing bacterial strains associated with the roots of wheat growing in different regions of Greece were isolated and characterized for plant-growth-promoting traits such as auxin production and phosphate solubilization. The phylogenetic position of the isolates was first assessed by the analysis of the PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene. The comparative sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences show that the isolates recovered in this study are grouped with Azospirillum brasilense, Azospirillum zeae, and Pseudomonas stutzeri. The diazotrophic nature of all isolates was confirmed by amplification of partial nifH gene sequences. The phylogenetic tree based on nifH gene sequences is consistent with 16S rRNA gene phylogeny. The isolates belonging to Azospirillum species were further characterized by examining the partial dnaK gene phylogenetic tree. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the ipdC gene was present in all Azospirillum isolates, suggesting that auxin is mainly synthesized via the indole-3-pyruvate pathway. Although members of P. stutzeri and A. zeae are known diazotrophic bacteria, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of isolation and characterization of strains belonging to these bacterial genera associated with wheat."

WDAI-3 is a homodimeric protein active against alpha-amylase from human saliva and from the insect Tenebrio molitor, but inactive against that from pig pancreas or against trypsin. Its N-terminal amino acid sequence is closer to those of the wheat dimeric inhibitors 0.19 and 0.53 (89-91% identical positions in 44 residues) than to that of the monomeric 0.28 inhibitor (69% identical positions).

"8061325","abstracttext","The S10 ribosomal protein gene (rps10), which has not been previously reported in any angiosperm mitochondrial genome, was identified by sequence analysis in the potato mitochondrial DNA. This gene is found downstream of a truncated non-functional apocytochrome b (cob) pseudogene, and is expressed as multiple transcripts ranging in size from 0.8 to 5.0 kb. Southern hybridization analysis indicates that rps10-homologous sequences are not present in the wheat mitochondrial genome. Sequence analysis of a single-copy region of the pea mitochondrial genome located upstream of cox1 [11] shows that a non-functional rps10 pseudogene is present in this species. These results suggest that the functional genes coding for wheat and pea mitochondrial RPS10 polypeptides have been translocated to the nucleus."

"1511142","articletitle","Characterization of the U3 and U6 snRNA genes from wheat: U3 snRNA genes in monocot plants are transcribed by RNA polymerase III."
"1511142","abstracttext","We have demonstrated recently that the genes encoding the U3 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) in dicot plants are transcribed by RNA polymerase III (pol III), and not RNA polymerase II (pol II) as in all other organisms studied to date. The U3 gene was the first example of a gene transcribed by different polymerases in different organisms. Based on phylogenetic arguments we proposed that a polymerase specificity change of the U3 snRNA gene promoter occurred during plant evolution. To map such an event we are examining the U3 gene polymerase specificity in other plant species. We report here the characterization of a U3 gene from wheat, a monocot plant. This gene contains the conserved promoter elements, USE and TATA, in a pol III-specific spacing seen also in a wheat U6 snRNA gene characterized in this report. Both the U3 and the U6 genes possess typical pol III termination signals but lack the cis element, responsible for 3'-end formation, found in all plant pol II-specific snRNA genes. In addition, expression of the U3 gene in transfected maize protoplasts is less sensitive to alpha-amanitin than a pol II-transcribed U2 gene. Based on these data we conclude that the wheat U3 gene is transcribed by pol III. This observation suggests that the postulated RNA polymerase specificity switch of the U3 gene took place prior to the divergence of angiosperm plants into monocots and dicots."

"16537502","abstracttext","Wheat ESTs mapped to deletion bins in the distal 42% of the long arm of chromosome 4B (4BL) were ordered in silico based on blastn homology against rice pseudochromosome 3. The ESTs spanned 29 cM on the short arm of rice chromosome 3, which is known to be syntenic to long arms of group-4 chromosomes of wheat. Fine-scale deletion-bin and genetic mapping revealed that 83% of ESTs were syntenic between wheat and rice, a far higher level of synteny than previously reported, and 6% were nonsyntenic (not located on rice chromosome 3). One inversion spanning a 5-cM region in rice and three deletion bins in wheat was identified. The remaining 11% of wheat ESTs showed no sequence homology in rice and mapped to the terminal 5% of the wheat chromosome 4BL. In this region, 27% of ESTs were duplicated, and it accounted for 70% of the recombination in the 4BL arm. Globally in wheat, no sequence homology ESTs mapped to the terminal bins, and ESTs rarely mapped to interstitial chromosomal regions known to be recombination hot spots. The wheat-rice comparative genomics analysis indicated that gene evolution occurs preferentially at the ends of chromosomes, driven by duplication and divergence associated with high rates of recombination."
"20444906","articletitle","Dosage effect of the short arm of chromosome 1 of rye on root morphology and anatomy in bread wheat."
"20444906","abstracttext","The spontaneous translocation of the short arm of chromosome 1 of rye (1RS) in bread wheat is associated with higher root biomass and grain yield. Recent studies have confirmed the presence of QTL for different root morphological traits on the 1RS arm in bread wheat. This study was conducted to address two questions in wheat root genetics. First, does the presence of the 1RS arm in bread wheat affect its root anatomy? Second, how does root morphology and anatomy of bread wheat respond to different dosages of 1RS? Near-isogenic plants with a different number (0 to 4 dosages) of 1RS translocations were studied for root morphology and anatomy. The F(1) hybrid, with single doses of the 1RS and 1AS arms, showed heterosis for root and shoot biomass. In other genotypes, with 0, 2, or 4 doses of 1RS, root biomass was incremental with the increase in the dosage of 1RS in bread wheat. This study also provided evidence of the presence of gene(s) influencing root xylem vessel number, size, and distribution in bread wheat. It was found that root vasculature follows a specific developmental pattern along the length of the tap root and 1RS dosage tends to affect the transitions differentially in different positions. This study indicated that the inherent differences in root morphology and anatomy of different 1RS lines may be advantageous compared to normal bread wheat to survive under stress conditions."

"21205321","abstracttext_results","In this study, four wheat Bell1-like homeobox (BLH) genes were isolated and named WBLH1 to WBLH4. WBLH1/WBLH3/WBLH4 expression was observed in the basal boundary region of the ovary in both normal pistils and transformed stamens. WBLH2 was also strongly expressed in integuments not only of normal ovules in pistils but also of the ectopic ovules in transformed stamens, and the WBLH2 expression pattern in the sterile pistils seemed to be identical to that in normal ovules of fertile pistils. In addition, WBLH1 and WBLH3 showed interactions with the three wheat KNOX proteins through the BEL domain. WBLH2, however, formed a complex with wheat KNOTTED1 and ROUGH SHEATH1 orthologs through SKY and BEL domains, but not with a wheat LIGULELESS4 ortholog."

KNOX-BLH interaction was conserved among various plant species, indicating the significance of KNOX-BLH complex formation in wheat developmental processes. The functional features of WBLH2 are likely to be distinct from other BLH gene functions in wheat development."

The results showed that the partial amphiploid strain consisted of 20 pairs of wheat chromosomes and 7 pairs of Ae. mutica chromosomes, with both wheat 7B chromosomes missing. EST-based molecular marker data suggested that the wheat-Ae. mutica addition line carries the 7T chromosome. Resistance tests indicated that both the partial amphiploid and the 7T addition line were highly resistant to powdery mildew, whereas the wheat control line Chinese Spring was highly susceptible, indicating the presence of a potentially new powdery mildew resistance gene on the Ae. mutica 7T chromosome. The karyotype, FISH patterns, and molecular markers can now be used to identify Ae. mutica chromatin in a wheat background, and the 7T addition could be used as a new powdery mildew resistance source for wheat breeding."

The development and characterization of new wheat-D. breviaristatum introgression lines is important to determine the novel gene(s) on specific chromosome(s). We first used multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to identify the individual D. breviaristatum V(b) chromosomes in a common wheat-D. breviaristatum partial amphiploid, TDH-2. The FISH patterns of D. breviaristatum chromosomes were different from those of D. villosum chromosomes. Lines D2146 and D2150 were selected from a cross between wheat line MY11 and wheat-D. breviaristatum partial amphiploid TDH-2, and they were characterized by FISH and PCR-based molecular markers. We found that D2150 was a monosomic addition line for chromosome 5V(b) of D. breviaristatum, while D2146 had the 5V(b)L chromosome arm translocated with wheat chromosome 5AS. Molecular marker analysis confirmed that the introduced D. breviaristatum chromosome 5V(b)L translocation possessed a duplicated region homoeologous to 5AS, revealing that the 5AS.5V(b)L translocation may not functionally compensate well. The dwarfing and the pre-harvest re-growth habits observed in the wheat-D. breviaristatum chromosome 5V(b) derivatives may be useful for future development of perennial growth wheat lines."

"26803524","abstracttext","The rotation of rice and wheat is widely used and highly endorsed, and simetryne (s-triazine herbicide) is one of the principal herbicides widely used in this rotation for weed and grass control. However, little is known regarding the mechanism of the ecological and physiological effects of simetryne on wheat crops. In this study, we performed a comprehensive investigation of crop response to simetryne to elucidate the accumulation and phytotoxicity of the herbicide in wheat crops. Wheat plants exposed to 0.8 to 8.0mgkg(-1) simetryne for 7 d exhibited suppressed growth and decreased chlorophyll content. With simetryne concentration in the soil varied from 0.8mgkg(-1) to 8.0mgkg(-1), simetryne was progressively accumulated by the wheat plants. The accumulation of simetryne in the wheat plants not only induced the over production of ROS and injured the membrane lipids but also stimulated the production of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione S-transferase (GST). A test of enzymatic activity and gene expression illustrated that the wheat plants were wise enough to motivate the antioxidant enzymes through both molecular and physiological mechanisms to alleviate the simetryne-induced stress. This study offers an illuminating insight into the effective adaptive response of the wheat plants to the simetryne stress."

"27358166","abstracttext","CBL-interacting protein kinases are involved in plant responses to abiotic stresses, including salt stress. However, the negative regulating mechanism of this gene family in response to salinity is less reported. In this study, we evaluated the role of TaCIPK25 in regulating salt response in wheat. Under conditions of high salinity, TaCIPK25 expression was markedly down-regulated in roots. Overexpression of TaCIPK25 resulted in hypersensitivity to Na(+) and superfluous accumulation of Na(+) in transgenic wheat lines. TaCIPK25 expression did not decline in transgenic wheat and remained at an even higher level than that in wild-type wheat controls under high-salinity treatment. Furthermore, transmembrane Na(+)/H(+) exchange was impaired in the root cells of transgenic wheat. These results suggested that TaCIPK25 negatively regulated salt response in wheat. Additionally, yeast-one-hybrid, β-glucuronidase activity and DNA-protein-interaction-enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assays showed that the transcription factor TaWRKY9 bound W-box in the TaCIPK25 promoter region. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays showed concomitantly inverted expression patterns of TaCIPK25 and TaWRKY9 in wheat roots under salt treatment, ABA application and inhibition of endogenous ABA condition. Overall, based on our results, in a salt stress condition, the negative salt response in wheat involved TaCIPK25 with the expression regulated by TaWRKY9."

"29222453","abstracttext","Fusarium crown rot (FCR) of wheat and barley, predominantly caused by the fungal pathogen Fusarium pseudograminearum, is a disease of economic significance. The quantitative nature of FCR resistance within cultivated wheat germplasm has significantly limited breeding efforts to enhanced FCR resistance in wheat. In this study, we characterized the molecular responses of Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium hereafter) to F. pseudograminearum infection using RNA-seq to determine whether Brachypodium can be exploited as a model system towards better understanding of F. pseudograminearum-wheat interaction. The transcriptional response to infection in Brachypodium was strikingly similar to that previously reported in wheat, both in shared expression patterns of wheat homologs of Brachypodium genes and functional overlap revealed through comparative gene ontology analysis in both species. Metabolites produced by various biosynthetic pathways induced in both wheat and Brachypodium were quantified, revealing a high degree of overlap between these two species in metabolic response to infection but also showed Brachypodium does not produce certain defence-related metabolites found in wheat. Functional analyses of candidate genes identified in this study will improve our understanding of resistance mechanisms and may lead to the development of new strategies to protect cereal crops from pathogen infection."

"29398945","abstracttext","Wheat flours are used to produce bread, pasta, breakfast cereals, and biscuits; the various properties of these end-products are attributed to the gluten content, produced as seed storage proteins in the wheat endosperm. Thus, genes encoding gluten protein are major targets of wheat breeders aiming to improve the various properties of wheat flour. Here, we describe a novel compensating wheat- Thinopyrum elongatum Robertsonian translocation (T1AS.1EL) line involving the short arm of wheat chromosome 1A (1AS) and the long arm of Th. elongatum chromosome 1E (1EL); we developed this line through centric breakage-fusion. Compared to the common wheat cultivars Chinese Spring and Norin 61, we detected two additional 1EL-derived high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GSs) in the T1AS.1EL plants. Based on the results of an SDS-sedimentation volume to estimate the gluten strength of T1AS.1EL-derived flour, we predict that T1AS.1EL-derived flour is better suited to bread-making than Chinese Spring- and Norin 61-derived flour and that this is because of its greater gluten diversity. Also, we were able to assign 33 of 121 wheat PCR-based Landmark Unique Gene markers to chromosome 1E of Th. elongatum . These markers can now be used for further chromosome engineering of the Th. elongatum segment of T1AS.1EL."

"28913791","abstracttext","Wheat is the major staple food crop and a source of calories for humans worldwide. A steady increase in the wheat production is essential to meet the demands of an ever-increasing global population and to achieve food security. The large size and structurally intricate genome of polyploid wheat had hindered the genomic analysis. However, with the advent of new genomic technologies such as next generation sequencing has led to genome drafts for bread wheat and its progenitors and has paved the way to design new strategies for crop improvement. Here we provide an overview of the advancements made in wheat genomics together with the available ""omics approaches"" and bioinformatics resources developed for wheat research. Advances in genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic technologies are highlighted as options to circumvent existing bottlenecks in the phenotypic and genomic selection and gene transfer. The contemporary reverse genetics approaches, including the novel genome editing techniques to inform targeted manipulation of a single/multiple genes and strategies for generating marker-free transgenic wheat plants, emphasize potential to revolutionize wheat improvement shortly."

"31542193","abstracttext","Septoria tritici blotch (STB) caused by the heterothallic ascomycete Zymoseptoria tritici is currently one of the most devastating diseases of wheat worldwide. The extent of sexual reproduction of this pathogen is well documented on bread wheat, but not on durum wheat. The objective of the present study was to quantify the occurrence of Z. tritici sexual reproduction on durum wheat in the Tunisian environment. The assessment was undertaken using a triple approach combining fruiting body assessment, ascospore trapping and population genetic analyses. The results highlighted the formation of pseudothecia on leaves and stubble from the autumn until the end of the growing season. Likewise, qPCR monitoring highlighted a constant release of Z. tritici airborne inoculum during the wheat-growing season, with a peak of production at the end of the season. Genetic investigations using microsatellites revealed high levels of gene and genotypic diversities, an equal distribution of mating types, and a lack of genetic clustering within and between growing seasons. Taken together, these findings indicate that Z. tritici undergoes sexual reproduction on durum wheat in Tunisia at least to the same extent than on bread wheat in Western Europe, and that the dry and warm climate does not affect the mating process of the fungus. Frequent occurrence of sexual reproduction is a valuable knowledge to take into account in STB control strategies on durum wheat."

"31321397","abstracttext","Wheat bran is the by-product of milling wheat flour which is one of the richest sources of dietary fiber, and cellulase that can be used for increasing the soluble dietary fiber. We hypothesize that wheat bran prebiotics would improve mineral-metabolism gene expression, and intestinal functionality, and increase health-promoting bacterial populations in vivo (Gallus gallus). By using the intra-amniotic administration procedure, five groups (non-injected; 18 Ω H 2 O; 100 mg mL -1 wheat bran prebiotics; 100 mg mL -1 cellulase wheat bran prebiotics; 50 mg mL -1 Arbinose) were utilized. Upon hatch, the cecum, small intestine and liver were collected for assessment. The results indicated that wheat bran prebiotics significantly up regulated the expression of certain brush border membrane functional genes, and mineral metabolism related proteins, in addition to increasing the intestinal beneficial bacterial populations. Prebiotics from wheat bran, cellulase wheat bran and arabinose increased the intestinal villi height, and goblet cell diameters and numbers."

"33291360","abstracttext","The micronutrients iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) are not only essential for plant survival and proliferation but are crucial for human health. Increasing Fe and Zn levels in edible parts of plants, known as biofortification, is seen a sustainable approach to alleviate micronutrient deficiency in humans. Wheat, as one of the leading staple foods worldwide, is recognized as a prioritized choice for Fe and Zn biofortification. However, to date, limited molecular and physiological mechanisms have been elucidated for Fe and Zn homeostasis in wheat. The expanding molecular understanding of Fe and Zn homeostasis in model plants is providing invaluable resources to biofortify wheat. Recent advancements in NGS (next generation sequencing) technologies coupled with improved wheat genome assembly and high-throughput genotyping platforms have initiated a revolution in resources and approaches for wheat genetic investigations and breeding. Here, we summarize molecular processes and genes involved in Fe and Zn homeostasis in the model plants Arabidopsis and rice, identify their orthologs in the wheat genome, and relate them to known wheat Fe/Zn QTL (quantitative trait locus/loci) based on physical positions. The current study provides the first inventory of the genes regulating grain Fe and Zn homeostasis in wheat, which will benefit gene discovery and breeding, and thereby accelerate the release of Fe- and Zn-enriched wheats."

"18398005","abstracttext","The wheat gene-rich region (GRR) 5L0.5 contains many important genes, including Ph1, the principal regulator of chromosome pairing. Comparative marker analysis identified 32 genes for the GRR controlling important agronomic traits. Detailed characterization of this region was accomplished by first physically localizing 213 wheat group 5L-specific markers, using group 5 nulli-tetrasomics, three Ph1 gene deletion/insertion mutants, and nine terminal deletion lines with their breakpoints around the 5L0.5 region. The Ph1 gene was localized to a much smaller region within the GRR (Ph1 gene region). Of the 61 markers that mapped in the four subregions of the GRR, 9 mapped in the Ph1 gene region. High stringency sequence comparison (e < 1 x10(-25)) of 157 group 5L-specific wheat ESTs identified orthologs for 80% sequences in rice and 71% in Arabidopsis. Rice orthologs were present on all rice chromosomes, although most (34%) were on rice chromosome 9 (R9). No single collinear region was identified in Arabidopsis even for a smaller region, such as the Ph1 gene region. Seven of the nine Ph1 gene region markers mapped within a 450-kb region on R9 with the same gene order. Detailed domain/motif analysis of the 91 putative genes present in the 450-kb region identified 26 candidates for the Ph1 gene, including genes involved in chromatin reorganization, microtubule attachment, acetyltransferases, methyltransferases, DNA binding, and meiosis/anther specific proteins. Five of these genes shared common domains/motifs with the meiosis specific genes Zip1, Scp1, Cor1, RAD50, RAD51, and RAD57. Wheat and Arabidopsis homologs for these rice genes were identified."

The NAM-A1 gene, located on chromosome 6AS of hexaploid wheat, has been implicated with increased wheat grain protein content (GPC). However, the NAM-A1 gene was removed from the 6AL/6VS translocation lines after the original chromosome 6AS was replaced by chromosome 6VS of Haynaldia villosa. The present study aimed to clone the NAM homologous gene from chromosome 6VS, to analyze the changes of GPC in the 6AL/6VS translocation lines, and to develop related molecular markers for wheat molecular breeding."
"27301696","abstracttext_results","A new NAM family gene, NAM-V1, was cloned from 6VS of H. villosa (GenBank ACC. no. KR873101). NAM-V1 contained an intact open reading frame (ORF) and putatively encodes a protein of 407 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that NAM-V1 was an orthologous gene of NAM-A1, B1, and D1. The determination of GPC in four Pm21 F2 segregation populations demonstrated that the replacement of NAM-A1 by NAM-V1 confers increased GPC in hexaploid wheat. Multiple sequence alignment of NAM-A1, B1, B2, D1, D2, and V1 showed the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites for each of the NAM genes, allowing us to develop a molecular marker, CauNAM-V1, for the specific detection of NAM-V1 gene. Our results indicate that CauNAM-V1 can be used as a novel DNA marker for NAM-V1, and can also be used for selecting Pm21 in wheat breeding programs. Further, we developed a marker, CauNAM-ABD, for the amplification and simultaneously distinguish among the NAM-A1, NAM-B1, NAM-B2, NAM-D1, and NAM-D2 genes in a single step. CauNAM-ABD enabled us to develop an efficient ""one-marker-for-five-genes"" procedure for identifying genes and its copy numbers related with grain protein content."

"2733691","abstracttext","The isolation and characterisation by DNA sequencing of a low molecular weight (LMW) glutenin gene from wheat is described. The deduced protein contains a signal peptide, a central repetitive region rich in proline and glutamine and N and C terminal non-repetitive domains, similar to other prolamins. A detailed comparison of the C terminal domain of 20 prolamin genes enabled us to divide them into 4 families. The LMW glutenin family is distinct from the alpha, beta- and gamma-gliadin families of wheat and is closest to the B hordein genes of barley. This and other comparisons were also used to assess the pattern of genetic variation among prolamin sequences and to provide a molecular basis for the interpretation of prolamin size polymorphism. The 5' flanking fragment of the isolated gene was previously shown to direct endosperm-specific expression of a reporter gene in transgenic tobacco. Evidence is provided that the isolated gene is also active in wheat and its transcription initiation site was determined. Features of the gene which may be relevant to its activity are discussed."

"1714358","abstracttext","The nucleotide sequence of a region of wheat chloroplast DNA containing the psbB gene for the 47 kDa chlorophyll a-binding protein of photosystem II has been determined. The gene encodes a polypeptide of 508 amino acid residues which is predicted to contain six hydrophobic membrane-spanning regions. The psbB gene is located 562 bp upstream of the psbH gene for the 10 kDa phosphoprotein of photosystem II. A small open reading frame of 38 codons is located between psbB and psbH, and on the opposite strand the psbN gene, encoding a photosystem II polypeptide of 43 amino acid residues, is located between orf38 and psbH. S1 nuclease mapping indicated that the 5' ends of transcripts were located 371 and 183 bp upstream of the psbB translation initiation codon. Predominant transcripts of 2.1 kb and 1.8 kb for psbB and 0.4 kb for psbH were present in RNA isolated from etiolated and greening wheat seedlings. Immunodecoration of Western blots indicated that the 47 kDa polypeptide was absent, or present in very low amounts, in dark-grown tissue and accumulated on greening, whereas the 10 kDa polypeptide was present in similar amounts in both dark-grown and greening seedlings. The 10 kDa polypeptide was phosphorylated in vitro by incubating wheat etioplast membranes with [gamma 32P] ATP."
"9539442","articletitle","Effect of the pairing gene Ph1 on centromere misdivision in common wheat."
"9539442","abstracttext","The cytologically diploid-like meiotic behavior of hexaploid wheat (i.e., exclusive bivalent pairing of homologues) is largely controlled by the pairing homoeologous gene Ph1. This gene suppresses pairing between homoeologous (partially homologous) chromosomes of the three closely related genomes that compose the hexaploid wheat complement. It has been previously proposed that Ph1 regulates meiotic pairing by determining the pattern of premeiotic arrangement of homologous and homoeologous chromosomes. We therefore assume that Ph1 action may be targeted at the interaction of centromeres with spindle microtubules--an interaction that is critical for movement of chromosomes to their specific interphase positions. Using monosomic lines of common wheat, we studied the effect of this gene on types and rates of centromere division of univalents at meiosis. In the presence of the normal two doses of Ph1, the frequency of transverse breakage (misdivision) of the centromere of univalent chromosomes was high in both first and second meiotic divisions; whereas with zero dose of the gene, this frequency was drastically reduced. The results suggest that Ph1 is a trans-acting gene affecting centromere-microtubules interaction. The findings are discussed in the context of the effect of Ph1 on interphase chromosome arrangement."

"10652126","abstracttext","The wheat genome encodes a family of germin-like proteins that differ with respect to regulation and tissue specificity of expression of the corresponding genes. While germin exhibits oxalate oxidase (E.C. 1.2.3.4.) activity, the germin-like proteins (GLPs) have no known enzymatic activity. A role of oxalate oxidase in plant defence has been proposed, based on the capacity of the enzyme to produce H2O2, a reactive oxygen species. The role in defence of germin and other members of the germin-like gene family was functionally assessed in a transient assay system based on particle bombardment of wheat leaves. Transient expression of the pathogen-induced germin gf-2.8 gene, but not of the constitutively expressed HvGLP1 gene, reduced the penetration efficiency of Blumeria (syn. Erysiphe) graminis f.sp. tritici, the causal agent of wheat powdery mildew, on transformed cells. Two engineered germin-gf-2.8 genes and the TaGLP2a gene, which all encoded proteins without oxalate oxidase activity, also reduced the penetration efficiency of the fungus, demonstrating that oxalate oxidase activity is not required for conferring enhanced resistance. Instead, activity tagging experiments showed that in cells transiently expressing the germin gf-2.8 gene, the transgene product became insolubilized at sites of attempted fungal penetration where localised production of H2O2 was observed. Thus, germin and GLPs may play a structural role in cell-wall re-enforcement during pathogen attack."

"16391684","abstracttext","The major aluminum (Al) tolerance gene in wheat ALMT1 confers. An Al-activated efflux of malate from root apices. We determined the genomic structure of the ALMT1 gene and found it consists of 6 exons interrupted by 5 introns. Sequencing a range of wheat genotypes identified 3 alleles for ALMT1, 1 of which was identical to the ALMT1 gene from an Aegilops tauschii accession. The ALMT1 gene was mapped to chromosome 4DL using 'Chinese Spring' deletion lines, and loss of ALMT1 coincided with the loss of both Al tolerance and Al-activated malate efflux. Aluminium tolerance in each of 5 different doubled-haploid populations was found to be conditioned by a single major gene. When ALMT1 was polymorphic between the parental lines, QTL and linkage analyses indicated that ALMT1 mapped to chromosome 4DL and cosegregated with Al tolerance. In 2 populations examined, Al tolerance also segregated with a greater capacity for Al-activated malate efflux. Aluminium tolerance was not associated with a particular coding allele for ALMT1, but was significantly correlated with the relative level of ALMT1 expression. These findings suggest that the Al tolerance in a diverse range of wheat genotypes is primarily conditioned by ALMT1."

"23546962","abstracttext","As the most ancient member of the wheat gluten family, the γ-gliadin genes are suitable for phylogenetic analysis among wheat and related species. Species in the grass genus Dasypyrum have been widely used for wheat cross breeding. However, the genomic relationships among Dasypyrum species have been little studied. We isolated 22 novel γ-gliadin gene sequences, among which 10 are putatively functional. The open reading frame lengths of these sequences range from 642 to 933 bp, and these putative proteins consist of five domains. Phylogenetic analyses showed that all Dasypyrum γ-gliadin gene sequences clustered in a large group; D. villosum and tetraploid D. breviaristatum γ-gliadin gene sequences clustered in a subgroup, while diploid D. breviaristatum γ-gliadin gene sequences clustered at the edge of the subgroup. All of the Dasypyrum γ-gliadin gene sequences were absent in three major T cell-stimulatory epitopes binding to HLA-DQ2/8 in celiac disease patients. Based on the phylogenetic analyses, we suggest that D. villosum and tetraploid D. breviaristatum evolved in parallel from a diploid ancestor D. breviaristatum."

"25962343","abstracttext","The 'developmental origins of health and disease' hypothesis proposes not only that we are what we eat, but also that we could be what our parents ate. Here, we aimed to improve health and performance of young piglets via maternal diets based on the hypothesis that maternal nutritional interventions change metabolic programming in piglets, reflected by differential gene expression early in life. Therefore, sows were fed either a regular diet, based on barley, wheat and wheat by-products, sugar beet pulp, palm oil and oilseed meal, or a high-fat (HF) diet consisting of the regular diet supplemented with an additional amount of 3.5% soybean oil and 1% fish oil at the expense of palm oil and wheat. Performance results, physiological parameters and gene expression in liver of piglets and blood of piglets and sows at day 7 after farrowing from both diet groups were compared. The HF diet tended to enhance growth rate of the offspring in the first week of life. No significant differences in gene expression in liver tissue and blood could be detected between the two groups, neither with whole-genome microarray analysis, nor with gene specific qPCR analysis. In this study, the feeding of a high-fat diet with increased amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) to gestating sows under practical farm settings did not induce significant changes in gene expression in sows and offspring."

"27460590","abstracttext_key message","Using bulk segregant analysis (BSA) coupling with RNA-seq and DNA markers identified a potentially novel nitrogen-dependent lesion mimic gene Ndhrl1 on 2BS in wheat. Lesion mimic (LM) refers to hypersensitive reaction-like (HRL) traits that appear on leaf tissue in the absence of plant pathogens. In a wheat line P7001, LM showed up on the leaves under the 0 g nitrogen (N) treatment, but disappeared when sufficient N was supplied, suggesting that LM is N-responsive and N dosage dependent. Using BSA strategy together with RNA-seq and DNA markers, we identified an N-dependent LM gene (Ndhrl1) and mapped it to the short arm of chromosome 2B using an F 5 recombinant inbred population developed from the cross of P7001 × P216. The putative gene was delimited into an interval of 8.1 cM flanked by the CAPS/dCAPS markers 7hrC9 and 7hr2dc14, and co-segregated with the dCAPS marker 7hrdc2. This gene is most likely a novel gene for LM in wheat based on its chromosomal location. Further analysis of RNA-seq data showed that plant-pathogen interaction, nitrogen metabolism, zeatin biosynthesis and plant hormone signal transduction pathways were significantly differentially expressed between LM and non-LM lines."

"29352079","abstracttext","Cadmium (Cd) is a heavy metal that has no known biological function and is toxic for many living organisms. The maximum level of Cd concentration allowed in the international market for wheat grain is 0.2 mg kg -1 Because phenotyping for Cd uptake is expensive and time consuming, molecular markers associated with genes conferring low Cd uptake would expedite selection and lead to the development of durum cultivars with reduced Cd concentrations. Here, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with a novel low Cd uptake locus in the durum experimental line D041735, which has hexaploid common wheat in its pedigree. Genetic analysis revealed a single major QTL for Cd uptake on chromosome arm 5BL within a 0.3 cM interval flanked by SNP markers. Analysis of the intervening sequence revealed a gene with homology to an aluminum-induced protein as a candidate gene. Validation and allelism tests revealed that the low Cd uptake gene identified in this study is different from the closely linked Cdu1-B gene, which also resides on 5BL. This study therefore showed that the durum experimental line D041735 contains a novel low Cd uptake gene that was likely acquired from hexaploid wheat."

The recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of Jagger × '2174' was inoculated with leaf rust pathogen THBJG and BBBDB, and evaluated for infection type (IT) response. A major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for THBJG and BBBDB was coincidently mapped to chromosome arm 2AS, and the QTL accounted for 56.6-66.2% of total phenotypic variation in infection type (IT) response to THBJG, and 72.1-86.9% to BBBDB. The causal gene for resistance to these rust races was mapped to the 2NS segment in Jagger. The 2NS segment was located in a region of approximately 27.8 Mb starting from the telomere of chromosome arm 2AS, based on the sequences of the A genome in tetraploid wheat. The Lr17a gene on chromosome arm 2AS was delimited to 3.1 Mb in the genomic region, which was orthologous to the 2NS segment. Therefore, the Lr37 gene in the 2NS segment can be pyramided with other effective resistance genes, rather than Lr17a in wheat, to improve resistance to rust diseases."

"30395461","abstracttext","The virulence and broad host range of Fusarium graminearum is associated with its ability to secrete an arsenal of phytotoxic secondary metabolites, including the regulated mycotoxins belonging to the deoxynivalenol family. The TRI genes responsible for the biosynthesis of deoxynivalenol and related compounds are usually expressed during fungal infection. However, the F. graminearum genome harbors an array of unexplored biosynthetic gene clusters that are also co-induced with the TRI genes, including the nonribosomal peptide synthetase 8 ( NRPS8) gene cluster. Here, we identify two bicyclic lipopeptides, gramillin A (1) and B (2), as the biosynthetic end products of NRPS8. Structural elucidation by high-resolution LC-MS and NMR, including 1 H- 15 N- 13 C HNCO and HNCA on isotopically enriched compounds, revealed that the gramillins possess a fused bicyclic structure with ring closure of the main peptide macrocycle occurring via an anhydride bond. Through targeted gene disruption, we characterized the GRA1 biosynthetic gene and its transcription factor GRA2 in the NRPS8 gene cluster. Further, we show that the gramillins are produced in planta on maize silks, promoting fungal virulence on maize but have no discernible effect on wheat head infection. Leaf infiltration of the gramillins induces cell death in maize, but not in wheat. Our results show that F. graminearum deploys the gramillins as a virulence agent in maize, but not in wheat, thus displaying host-specific adaptation."

"30446876","abstracttext","Wheat can adapt to most agricultural conditions across temperate regions. This success is the result of phenotypic plasticity conferred by a large and complex genome composed of three homoeologous genomes (A, B, and D). Although drought is a major cause of yield and quality loss in wheat, the adaptive mechanisms and gene networks underlying drought responses in the field remain largely unknown. Here, we addressed this by utilizing an interdisciplinary approach involving field water status phenotyping, sampling, and gene expression analyses. Overall, changes at the transcriptional level were reflected in plant spectral traits amenable to field-level physiological measurements, although changes in photosynthesis-related pathways were found likely to be under more complex post-transcriptional control. Examining homoeologous genes with a 1:1:1 relationship across the A, B, and D genomes (triads), we revealed a complex genomic architecture for drought responses under field conditions, involving gene homoeolog specialization, multiple gene clusters, gene families, miRNAs, and transcription factors coordinating these responses. Our results provide a new focus for genomics-assisted breeding of drought-tolerant wheat cultivars."

In the Pavon 'S', Myna 'S', Frontana'S', and Sparow'S' varieties a product with a length of 242 bp has been identified, which is specific to the Xwmc44 marker linked to the brown rust resistance gene Lr46. In the next step, the differences in the expression of microRNA (miR5085 and miR164) associated with the Lr46 gene, which is responsible for different resistance of selected wheat cultivars to leaf rust, were examined using emulsion PCR (ddPCR). In the experiment, biotic stress was induced in mature plants by infecting them with fungal spores under controlled conditions in a growth chamber. For analysis the plant material was collected before inoculation and 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after inoculation. The experiments also showed that plant infection with Puccinia triticina resulted in an increase in miR164 expression in cultivars carrying the Lr46 gene. The expression of miR164 remained stable in a control cultivar (HN ROD) lacking this gene. This has proved that miR164 can be involved in leaf rust resistance mechanisms."

"9401023","abstracttext","Pseudomonas aureofaciens 30-84 is a soilborne bacterium that colonizes the wheat rhizosphere. This strain produces three phenazine antibiotics which suppress take-all disease of wheat by inhibition of the causative agent Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici. Phenazines also enhance survival of 30-84 within the wheat rhizosphere in competition with other organisms. Expression of the phenazine biosynthetic operon is controlled by the phzR/phzI N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) response system (L. S. Pierson III et al., J. Bacterial 176:3966-3974, 1994; D. W. Wood and L. S. Pierson III, Gene 168:49-53, 1996). By using high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry, the AHL produced by PhzI has now been identified as N-hexanoyl-homoserine lactone (HHL). In addition, the ability of HHL to serve as an interpopulation signal molecule in the wheat rhizosphere has been examined by using isogenic reporter strains. Disruption of phzI reduced expression of the phenazine biosynthetic operon 1,000-fold in the wheat rhizosphere. Coinoculation of an isogenic strain which produced the endogenous HHL signal restored phenazine gene expression in the phzI mutant to wild-type levels in situ. These results demonstrate that HHL is required for phenazine expression in situ and is an effective interpopulation signal molecule in the wheat rhizosphere."

"12906113","abstracttext","The role in virulence of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters MgAtr1, MgAtr2, MgAtr3, MgAtr4, and MgAtr5 from Mycosphaerella graminicola was analyzed by gene disruption or replacement on seedlings of the susceptible wheat cultivar Obelisk. Disruption strains of MgAtr1 and MgAtr2 and replacement strains of MgAtr3 and MgAtr5 displayed the same phenotype as control strains, while virulence of the MgAtr4 disruption strains was significantly reduced. This reduction in virulence was independent of the wheat cultivar used. Histopathological analysis of the infection process revealed that MgAtr4 disruption strains colonize substomatal cavities less efficiently and display reduced intercellular growth in the apoplast of wheat leaves. In vitro growth experiments in different media showed no fitness penalty associated with the disruption of MgAtr4. Expression analysis demonstrated that transcripts of the constitutively expressed gene CYP51 encoding the fungal-specific cytochrome P450 sterol 14alpha-demethylase from M. graminicola were not detectable in interaction RNA from wheat infected with MgAtr4 disruption strains, thus confirming the reduced intercellular growth of these strains. The results indicate that MgAtr4 is a virulence factor of M. graminicola during pathogenesis on wheat and may function in protection against fungitoxic compounds present around the substomatal cavities of wheat leaves. MgAtr4 is the first virulence factor cloned from this important plant pathogen."

Further analysis using anchored rice contiguous sequences and TBLASTX alignments in a second alignment step showed interruptions by orthologous genes that map elsewhere in the wheat genome. This indicates that gene content and order is not as conserved as large chromosomal blocks as previously predicted. Similarly, chromosome 7L contains syntenic units with rice 6 and 8 but is interrupted by combinations of intrachromosomal and interchromosomal rearrangements involving syntenic units and single gene orthologs from other rice chromosome groups. We have used the rice sequence annotations to identify genes that can be used to develop markers linked to biosynthetic pathways on 3BS controlling xanthophyll production in wheat and thus involved in determining flour colour."

"16231740","abstracttext","In this study, the level of amylose was reduced in wheat seeds by RNAi strategy. Because the synthesis of amylose is catalyzed by the granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI or WAXY protein), the Waxy gene of wheat was isolated from wheat seeds by using RT-PCR. Southern analysis confirmed that there were three Waxy genes in wheat genome. Northern hybridization showed that Waxy mRNA accumulated in seeds following pollination. By RNAi strategy,the 683 bp sense and antisense fragments in reverse orientation separated by a 150 bp intron were cloned into pCAMBIA 3300 just downstream of the maize ub/1 promoter. By Agrobacteriurn-mediated wheat transformation method, four transgenic plants (Cultivar Yangmai 10) were identified by PCR, RT-PCR and leaf painting assay. The level of amylose in the endosperm were significantly reduced in transgenic seeds as checked by iodine staining and analysis of amylose content. The results indicated that RNA silencing of Waxy gene resulted in low level of amylose in the seeds of transgenic wheat."

"20217382","abstracttext","Little is known about the genetic impacts of modern plant breeding on specific breeding target loci. Resequencing cloned genes can identify all mutations in single genes for population-based analyses of genetic changes in improved gene pools. Ninety-five wheat cultivars released in Canada from 1845 to 2004 were sequenced at the wheat leaf rust resistance locus Lr21. Characterization of the DNA fragment of length 4,071 bp, covering the Lr21 gene from -92 to +4,261, revealed 13 SNPs, four indels, 10 haplotypes, and 4 major haplotype groups. A new SCAR marker was developed to identify the resistant haplotype and haplotype groups. Non-synonymous polymorphic sites and haplotype numbers were increased over the 100 years of wheat breeding. Nucleotide diversity of the wheat cultivars was gradually reduced from 1845 to 1993 and increased after the release of the first Lr21 wheat cultivar AC Cora in 1994. Positive selection measured with Tajima's D was observed in the cultivars released before 1935. At least two recombination events were inferred in those cultivars released before 1993. Linkage disequilibrium at the locus was decreased over time. These findings demonstrate not only the effectiveness of the wheat breeding in the improvement of leaf rust resistance, but also are useful to understand the genetic influences of a long-term artificial selection on individual loci."

"21934119","abstracttext","The proteins of the MYB superfamily play central roles in developmental processes and defence responses in plants. Sixty unique wheat MYB genes that contain full-length cDNA sequences were isolated. These 60 genes were grouped into three categories, namely one R1R2R3-MYB, 22 R2R3-MYBs, and 37 MYB-related members. The sequence composition of the R2 and R3 repeats was conserved among the 22 wheat R2R3-MYB proteins. Phylogenetic comparison of the members of this superfamily among wheat, rice, and Arabidopsis revealed that the putative functions of some wheat MYB proteins were clustered into the Arabidopsis functional clades. Tissue-specific expression profiles showed that most of the wheat MYB genes were expressed in all of the tissues examined, suggesting that wheat MYB genes take part in multiple cellular processes. The expression analysis during abiotic stress identified a group of MYB genes that respond to one or more stress treatments. The overexpression of a salt-inducible gene, TaMYB32, enhanced the tolerance to salt stress in transgenic Arabidopsis. This study is the first comprehensive study of the MYB gene family in Triticeae."

"22468101","abstracttext","Lower respiratory symptoms in bakery workers may be induced by wheat flour and endotoxins. We hypothesized that endotoxins from wheat flour may stimulate innate immunity and that interleukin-18 (IL-18) gene polymorphisms may affect their regulatory role in innate immune responses to endotoxins. To investigate the genetic contribution of IL-18 to sensitization to wheat flour, we performed a genetic association study of IL-18 in Korean bakery workers. A total of 373 bakery workers undertook a questionnaire regarding work-related symptoms. Skin prick tests with common and occupational allergens were performed and specific antibodies to wheat flour were measured by ELISA. Three polymorphisms of the IL-18 gene (-607A/C, -137G/C, 8674C/G) were genotyped, and the functional effects of the polymorphisms were analyzed using the luciferase reporter assay. Genotypes of -137G/C (GC or CC) and haplotype ht3 [ACC] showed a significant association with the rate of sensitization to wheat flour. Luciferase activity assay indicated ht3 [AC] as a low transcript haplotype. In conclusion, the regulatory role of IL-18 in lipopolysaccharide-induced responses in bakery workers may be affected by this polymorphism, thus contributing to the development of sensitization to wheat flour and work-related respiratory symptoms."

"24646323","abstracttext","High-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays are a powerful tool for studying genomic patterns of diversity, inferring ancestral relationships between individuals in populations and studying marker-trait associations in mapping experiments. We developed a genotyping array including about 90,000 gene-associated SNPs and used it to characterize genetic variation in allohexaploid and allotetraploid wheat populations. The array includes a significant fraction of common genome-wide distributed SNPs that are represented in populations of diverse geographical origin. We used density-based spatial clustering algorithms to enable high-throughput genotype calling in complex data sets obtained for polyploid wheat. We show that these model-free clustering algorithms provide accurate genotype calling in the presence of multiple clusters including clusters with low signal intensity resulting from significant sequence divergence at the target SNP site or gene deletions. Assays that detect low-intensity clusters can provide insight into the distribution of presence-absence variation (PAV) in wheat populations. A total of 46 977 SNPs from the wheat 90K array were genetically mapped using a combination of eight mapping populations. The developed array and cluster identification algorithms provide an opportunity to infer detailed haplotype structure in polyploid wheat and will serve as an invaluable resource for diversity studies and investigating the genetic basis of trait variation in wheat."

"24099389","abstracttext","Aegilops sharonensis (Sharon goatgrass), a diploid wheat relative, is known to be a rich source of disease resistance genes for wheat improvement. To facilitate the transfer of these genes into wheat, information on their chromosomal location is important. A genetic linkage map of Ae. sharonensis was constructed based on 179 F2 plants derived from a cross between accessions resistant (1644) and susceptible (1193) to wheat leaf rust. The linkage map was based on 389 markers (377 Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) and 12 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci) and was comprised of 10 linkage groups, ranging from 2.3 to 124.6 cM. The total genetic length of the map was 818.0 cM, with an average interval distance between markers of 3.63 cM. Based on the chromosomal location of 115 markers previously mapped in wheat, the four linkage groups of A, B, C, and E were assigned to Ae. sharonensis (S(sh)) and homoeologous wheat chromosomes 6, 1, 3, and 2. The single dominant gene (designated LrAeSh1644) conferring resistance to leaf rust race THBJ in accession 1644 was positioned on linkage group A (chromosome 6S(sh)) and was flanked by DArT markers wpt-9881 (at 1.9 cM distal from the gene) and wpt-6925 (4.5 cM proximal). This study clearly demonstrates the utility of DArT for genotyping uncharacterized species and tagging resistance genes where pertinent genomic information is lacking."

"24226358","abstracttext","Four wheat-rye lines derived from a cross between hexaploid wheat 'ND 7532' and 'Chaupon' rye were homogeneous for resistance to biotype L of the Hessian fly,Mayetiola destructor. Because the wheat parent was susceptible and the rye parent was resistant to larval feeding, resistance was derived from rye. Resistance of 'Chaupon' and the wheat-rye lines was expressed as larval antibiosis. First-instar larvae died after feeding on plants. Chromosomal analyses using C- and N-banding techniques were performed on plants of each line to identify genomes and structural changes of chromosomes. Results showed that two of the resistant lines were chromosome addition lines carrying either the complete rye chromosome,2R, or only the long arm of2R. The other two resistant lines were identified as being2BS/ 2RL wheat-rye translocation lines. It was concluded, therefore, that the long arm of rye chromosome2R carries a gene or gene complex that conditions antibiosis to Hessian fly larvae and, in the2BS/2RL translocation lines, this rye chromatin is cytologically stable and can be used directly in wheat breeding programs."

"25852713","abstracttext","Intensive breeding has led to a narrowing in the genetic base of our major crops. In wheat, access to the extensive gene pool residing in its many and varied relatives (some cultivated, others wild) is hampered by the block on recombination imposed by the Ph1 (Pairing homoeologous 1) gene. Here, the ph1b mutant has been exploited to induced allosyndesis between wheat chromosomes and those of both Hordeum vulgare (cultivated barley) and H. chilense (a wild barley). A number of single chromosome Hordeum sp. substitution and addition lines in wheat were crossed and backcrossed to the ph1b mutant to produce plants in which pairing between the wheat and the non-wheat chromosomes was not suppressed by the presence of Ph1. Genomic in situ hybridization was applied to almost 500 BC1F2 progeny as a screen for allosyndetic recombinants. Chromosome rearrangements were detected affecting H. chilense chromosomes 4H (ch) , 5H (ch) , 6H (ch) , and 7H (ch) and H. vulgare chromosomes 4H (v) , 6H (v) , and 7H (v) . Two of these were clearly the product of a recombination event involving chromosome 4H (ch) and a wheat chromosome."
"27734576","articletitle","The durable wheat disease resistance gene Lr34 confers common rust and northern corn leaf blight resistance in maize."
"27734576","abstracttext","Maize (corn) is one of the most widely grown cereal crops globally. Fungal diseases of maize cause significant economic damage by reducing maize yields and by increasing input costs for disease management. The most sustainable control of maize diseases is through the release and planting of maize cultivars with durable disease resistance. The wheat gene Lr34 provides durable and partial field resistance against multiple fungal diseases of wheat, including three wheat rust pathogens and wheat powdery mildew. Because of its unique qualities, Lr34 became a cornerstone in many wheat disease resistance programmes. The Lr34 resistance is encoded by a rare variant of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that evolved after wheat domestication. An Lr34-like disease resistance phenotype has not been reported in other cereal species, including maize. Here, we transformed the Lr34 resistance gene into the maize hybrid Hi-II. Lr34-expressing maize plants showed increased resistance against the biotrophic fungal disease common rust and the hemi-biotrophic disease northern corn leaf blight. Furthermore, the Lr34-expressing maize plants developed a late leaf tip necrosis phenotype, without negative impact on plant growth. With this and previous reports, it could be shown that Lr34 is effective against various biotrophic and hemi-biotrophic diseases that collectively parasitize all major cereal crop species."

"28364804","abstracttext","Succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicides have been shown to increase PSII efficiency and photosynthesis under drought stress in the absence of disease to enhance the biomass and yield of winter wheat. However, the molecular mechanism of improved photosynthetic efficiency observed in SDHI-treated wheat has not been previously elucidated. Here we used a combination of chlorophyll fluorescence, gas exchange and gene expression analysis, to aid our understanding of the basis of the physiological responses of wheat seedlings under drought conditions to sedaxane, a novel SDHI seed treatment. We show that sedaxane increased the efficiency of PSII photochemistry, reduced non-photochemical quenching and improved the photosynthesis and biomass in wheat correlating with systemic changes in the expression of genes involved in defense, chlorophyll synthesis and cell wall modification. We applied a coexpression network-based approach using differentially expressed genes of leaves, roots and pregerminated seeds from our wheat array datasets to identify the most important hub genes, with top ranked correlation (higher gene association value and z-score) involved in cell wall expansion and strengthening, wax and pigment biosynthesis and defense. The results indicate that sedaxane confers tolerant responses of wheat plants grown under drought conditions by redirecting metabolites from defense/stress responses towards growth and adaptive development."

"29101332","abstracttext","Cereal cyst nematode (Heterodera avenae) is attracted to and aggregated around wheat roots to initiate infection, but this interaction between wheat and the nematode is not fully understood. The transcriptional responses of both wheat and H. avenae were examined during their early contact stage by mRNA sequencing analysis; certain numbers of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were validated using quantitative real-time PCR. The immobile host wheat root only had 93 DEGs (27 up-regulated and 66 down-regulated), while the mobile plant parasitic nematode reacted much more actively with 879 DEGs (867 up-regulated and 12 down-regulated). Among them, a number of wheat DEGs (mostly down-regulated) were involved in biotic stress pathways, while several putative effector genes were up-regulated in the nematode DEGs. One putative chitinase-like effector gene of H. avenae was able to suppress BAX-triggered programmed cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana. Results of these experiments demonstrated that nematode responded more actively than wheat during the contact stage of parasitism. The parasite's responses mainly involved up-regulation of genes including at least one anti-plant-defence effector gene, whereas the host responses mainly involved down-regulation of certain defence-related genes."

"30753561","abstracttext","Folates are indispensable co-factors for one-carbon metabolism in all organisms. In humans, suboptimal folate intake results in serious disorders. One promising strategy for improving human folate status is to enhance folate levels in food crops by metabolic engineering. In this study, we cloned two GmGCHI (GTP cyclohydrolase I) genes (Gm8gGCHI and Gm3gGCHI) and one GmADCS (aminodeoxychorismate synthase) gene from soybean, which are responsible for synthesizing the folate precursors pterin and p-aminobenzoate, respectively. We initially confirmed their functions in transgenic Arabidopsis plants and found that Gm8gGCHI increased pterin and folate production more than Gm3gGCHI did. We then co-expressed Gm8gGCHI and GmADCS driven by endosperm-specific promoters in maize and wheat, two major staple crops, to boost their folate metabolic flux. A 4.2-fold and 2.3-fold increase in folate levels were observed in transgenic maize and wheat grains, respectively. To optimize wheat folate enhancement, codon-optimized Gm8gGCHI and tomato LeADCS genes under the control of a wheat endosperm-specific glutenin promoter (1Dx5) were co-transformed. This yielded a 5.6-fold increase in folate in transgenic wheat grains (Gm8gGCHI+/LeADCS+). This two-gene co-expression strategy therefore has the potential to greatly enhance folate levels in maize and wheat, thus improving their nutritional value."

"31529497","abstracttext","Wheat stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), poses a tremendous threat to the production of wheat worldwide. The molecular mechanisms of Pst effectors that regulate wheat immunity are poorly understood. In this study, we identified an effector Pst18363 from Pst that suppresses plant cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana and in wheat. Knocking down Pst18363 expression by virus-mediated host-induced gene silencing significantly decreased the number of rust pustules, indicating that Pst18363 functions as an important pathogenicity factor in Pst. Pst18363 was proven to interact with wheat Nudix hydrolase 23 TaNUDX23. In wheat, silencing of TaNUDX23 by virus-induced gene silencing increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation induced by the avirulent Pst race CYR23, whereas overexpression of TaNUDX23 suppressed ROS accumulation induced by flg22 in Arabidopsis. In addition, TaNUDX23 suppressed Pst candidate effector Pst322-trigged cell death by decreasing ROS accumulation in N. benthamiana. Knocking down of TaNUDX23 expression attenuated Pst infection, indicating that TaNUDX23 is a negative regulator of defence. In N. benthamiana, Pst18363 stabilises TaNUDX23. Overall, our data suggest that Pst18363 stabilises TaNUDX23, which suppresses ROS accumulation to facilitate Pst infection."

"33179162","abstracttext_key message","Present study revealed that specific expression of TaYUC10.3 in wheat young seeds could increase the content of auxin, and protein. Auxin is a vital endogenous hormone in plants, which is involved in the regulation of various physiological and biochemical processes in plants. The flavin-containing monooxygenase encoded by the YUCCA gene is a rate-limiting enzyme in the tryptophan-dependent pathway of auxin synthesis. TaYUC10.3 was identified, cloned and found that it was abundantly expressed in wheat young seeds. In this study, a seed-specific expression vector of TaYUC10.3 was constructed with the promoter of 1Bx17 glutenin subunit gene and transformed wheat using the particle bombardment method. The quantitative RT-PCR showed that TaYUC10.3 was expressed in a large amount in young seeds of the transgenic lines. Plant hormone-targeted metabolomics showed that the auxin content of the transgenic lines was significantly increased compared with controls. The GC / MS non-targeted metabolite multiple statistical analyses showed that the variable importance in projection (VIP) of tryptophan reduced in the transgenic lines. Simultaneously, the VIP of indole acetic acid increased. The precursor amino acids for synthesizing some proteins and carbohydrates were upregulated in the transgenic lines. Subsequently, it was found that the protein content of the seeds of the transgenic TaYUC10.3 wheat was significantly higher than that of the control. The wet gluten content and sedimentation value of the transgenic TaYUC10.3 wheat were also high. This result indicated that TaYUC10.3 might participate in auxin synthesis and affects the protein content of wheat seeds."

"18470030","abstracttext","A number of Triticeae species were tested for tiller production, shoot dry matter production, and root penetration in waterlogged soil, and Thinopyrum elongatum and Elytrigia repens were shown to have better tolerance than wheat using these criteria. Tests of a number of wheat-alien amphiploids showed that there was at least partial expression of this exotic genetic variation in a wheat genetic background. The presence of chromosomes 2E and 4E of Th. elongatum was associated with a positive effect on root growth in waterlogged conditions. The positive effect of the 4E chromosome addition was mimicked by tetrasomic lines carrying extra doses of wheat homoeologues 4B and 4D, and it was concluded that the beneficial effect contributed by the presence of 4E was probably due to an increased dosage of group 4 chromosomes. However, the positive effect of adding chromosome 2E to wheat could not be reproduced by added doses of chromosomes 2A, 2B, or 2D, suggesting that this alien chromosome carries gene(s) for tolerance not present on its wheat homoeologues. This gene(s) was further located to the long arm of chromosome 2E by testing ditelosomic addition lines."

They involve transfers of segments of the long arm of chromosome 1D of bread wheat to the long arm of rye chromosome 1R. The translocated long arms of the chromosomes were mapped genetically in wheat and triticale using polymorphism for C-banding patterns, allelic variation of the Glu-D1 gene, and a telocentric chromosome 1RL. The total frequency and the general distribution of recombination in the translocated arms was similar to that in normal long arms of group-1 chromosomes in wheat, rye, and triticale, except that the distal rye segments of the translocations showed a 15- to 20-fold increase in recombination frequency compared with normal 1R. Despite major differences in the physical structure of the translocated arms, both appeared very similar genetically, suggesting that genetic mapping is a poor indicator of the physical structure of translocations. Genetic length of the 1DL segment in chromosome 1R.1D5+10&minus;1 was 31 cM, making the chromosome unsuitable for Glu-D1 dosage manipulation in wheat. The potential of chromosome 1R.1D5+10&minus;2 for wheat breeding needs further testing. However, both chromosomes behave normally in hexaploid triticale."

"32771153","abstracttext","Expansins loosen plant cell walls and are involved in cell enlargement and various abiotic stresses. In previous studies, we cloned the expansin gene TaEXPA2 from the wheat cultivar HF9703. Here, we studied its function and regulation in wheat drought stress tolerance. The results indicated that TaEXPA2-overexpressing wheat plants (OE) exhibited drought tolerant phenotypes, whereas down-regulation of TaEXPA2 by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in elevated drought sensitivity, as measured by survival rate, photosynthetic rate and water containing ability under drought stress. Overexpression of TaEXPA2 enhanced the antioxidant capacity in wheat plants, via elevation of antioxidant enzyme activity and the increase of the transcripts of some ROS scavenging enzyme-related genes. Further investigation revealed that TaEXPA2 positively influenced lateral root formation under drought conditions. A MYB transcription factor of wheat named TaMPS activates TaEXPA2 expression directly by binding to its promoter. Overexpression of TaMPS in Arabidopsis conferred drought tolerance associated with improved lateral root number, and the close homolog genes of TaEXPA2 were up-regulated in Arabidopsis roots overexpressing TaMPS, which suggest that TaMPS may function as one of the regulator of TaEXPA2 gene expression in the root lateral development under drought stress. These findings suggest that TaEXPA2 positively regulates drought stress tolerance in wheat."

"19196346","abstracttext","One function of plant lectins such as wheat germ agglutinin is to serve as defences against herbivorous insects. The midgut is one critical site affected by dietary lectins. We observed marked cellular, structural and gene expression changes in the midguts of Drosophila melanogaster third instar larvae that were fed wheat germ agglutinin. Some of these changes were similar to those observed in the midguts of starved D. melanogaster. Dietary wheat germ agglutinin caused shortening, branching, swelling, distortion and in some cases disintegration of the midgut microvilli. Starvation was accompanied primarily by shortening of the microvilli. Microarray analyses revealed that dietary wheat germ agglutinin evoked differential expression of 61 transcripts; seven of these were also differentially expressed in starved D. melanogaster. The differentially transcribed gene clusters in wheat germ agglutinin-fed larvae were associated with (1) cytoskeleton organization; (2) digestive enzymes; (3) detoxification reactions; and (4) energy metabolism. Four possible transcription factor binding motifs were associated with the differentially expressed genes. One of these exhibited substantial similarity to MyoD, a transcription factor binding motif associated with cellular structures in mammals. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that wheat germ agglutinin caused a starvation-like effect and structural changes of midgut cells of D. melanogaster third-instar larvae."

"15912342","abstracttext","Chromosome 7E from Lophopyrum ponticum carries a valuable leaf rust resistant gene designated Lr19. This gene has not been widely used in common wheat breeding because of linkage with the yellow pigment gene Y. This gene tints flour yellow, reducing its appeal in bread making. However, a high level of yellow pigment is desirable in durum wheat breeding. We produced 97 recombinant chromosomes between L. ponticum transfer 7D.7E#1 and its wheat homoeologues, using the ph1b mutation that promotes homoeologous pairing. We characterized a subset of 37 of these lines with 11 molecular markers and evaluated their resistance to leaf rust and the abundance of yellow pigment. The Lr19 gene was mapped between loci Xwg420 and Xmwg2062, whereas Y was mapped distal to Xpsr687, the most distal marker on the long arm of chromosome 7. A short terminal 7EL segment translocated to 7A, including Lr19 and Y (line 1-23), has been transferred to durum wheat by backcrossing. The presence of this alien segment significantly increased the abundance of yellow pigment. The Lr19 also conferred resistance to a new durum leaf rust race from California and Mexico that is virulent on most durum wheat cultivars. The new durum lines with the recombinant 7E segment will be useful parents to increase yellow pigment and leaf rust resistance in durum wheat breeding programs. For the common wheat breeding programs, we selected the recombinant line 1-96, which has an interstitial 7E segment carrying Lr19 but not Y. This recombinant line can be used to improve leaf rust resistance without affecting flour color. The 7EL/7DL 1-96 recombinant chromosome did not show the meiotic self-elimination previously reported for a 7EL/7BL translocation."

TaPod-A1 is within one of the three QTL. Peroxidase (POD) activity in grain is an important factor determining the color of flour and end-use products of wheat, such as noodles and steamed bread. Mapping QTL for POD activity, characterization of POD genes and development of gene-specific markers are important for molecular marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for POD activity in common wheat were mapped using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a Doumai/Shi 4185 cross grown in four environments and genotyped using the wheat 90 K iSelect assay. Three novel QTL for POD activity, QPod.caas-3AL, QPod.caas-4BS and QPod.caas-5AS, were identified on chromosomes 3AL, 4BS and 5AS, explaining 5.3-21.2% of phenotypic variance across environments. The full-length genomic DNA (gDNA) sequence of a POD gene, designated TaPod-A1, on chromosome 3A was characterized by homolog cloning and PCR verification. Two complementary dominant sequence-tagged site (STS) markers, POD-3A1 and POD-3A2, were developed based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between two alleles at the TaPod-A1 locus, amplifying 291- and 766-bp fragments in cultivars with lower and higher POD activities, respectively. The two gene-specific markers were mapped on chromosome 3AL using a set of Chinese Spring (CS) nulli-tetrasomic lines, and ditelosomic lines 3AL and 3AS. QTL analysis indicated that QPod.caas-3AL co-segregated with the gene-specific markers POD-3A1 and POD-3A2. POD-3A1 and POD-3A2 were verified on 281 wheat cultivars and advanced lines, and showed significant (P < 0.05) associations with POD activities. POD-3A1 and POD-3A2 may be useful as markers for improving color attributes in wheat breeding programs."

"25735638","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) and Fusarium seedling blight (FSB) of wheat, caused by Fusarium pathogens, are devastating diseases worldwide. We report the expression of RNA interference (RNAi) sequences derived from an essential Fusarium graminearum (Fg) virulence gene, chitin synthase (Chs) 3b, as a method to enhance resistance of wheat plants to fungal pathogens. Deletion of Chs3b was lethal to Fg; disruption of the other Chs gene family members generated knockout mutants with diverse impacts on Fg. Comparative expression analyses revealed that among the Chs gene family members, Chs3b had the highest expression levels during Fg colonization of wheat. Three hairpin RNAi constructs corresponding to the different regions of Chs3b were found to silence Chs3b in transgenic Fg strains. Co-expression of these three RNAi constructs in two independent elite wheat cultivar transgenic lines conferred high levels of stable, consistent resistance (combined type I and II resistance) to both FHB and FSB throughout the T3 to T5 generations. Confocal microscopy revealed profoundly restricted mycelia in Fg-infected transgenic wheat plants. Presence of the three specific short interfering RNAs in transgenic wheat plants was confirmed by Northern blotting, and these RNAs efficiently down-regulated Chs3b in the colonizing Fusarium pathogens on wheat seedlings and spikes. Our results demonstrate that host-induced gene silencing of an essential fungal chitin synthase gene is an effective strategy for enhancing resistance in crop plants under field test conditions."

The chromosomal location mapping analysis indicated that these three types of SOD genes were only distributed on 2, 4, and 7 chromosomes, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses of wheat SODs and several other species revealed that these SOD proteins can be assigned to two major categories. SOD1 mainly comprises of Cu/Zn-SODs, and SOD2 mainly comprises of Fe-SODs and Mn-SODs. Gene structure and motif analyses indicated that most of the SOD genes showed a relatively conserved exon/intron arrangement and motif composition. Analyses of transcriptional data indicated that most of the wheat SOD genes were expressed in almost all of the examined tissues and had important functions in abiotic stress resistance. Finally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis was used to reveal the regulating roles of wheat SOD gene family in response to NaCl, mannitol, and polyethylene glycol stresses. qRT-PCR showed that eight randomly selected genes with relatively high expression levels responded to all three stresses based on released transcriptome data. However, their degree of response and response patterns were different. Interestingly, among these genes, TaSOD1.7, TaSOD1.9, TaSOD2.1, and TaSOD2.3 feature research value owing to their remarkable expression-fold change in leaves or roots under different stresses. Overall, our results provide a basis of further functional research on the SOD gene family in wheat and facilitate their potential use for applications in the genetic improvement on wheat in drought and salt stress environments."

"31664905","abstracttext_background","Herbicide tolerance is an important trait that allows effective weed management in wheat crops in dryland farming. Genetic knowledge of metribuzin tolerance in wheat is needed to develop new cultivars for the industry. Here, we investigated gene effects for metribuzin tolerance in nine crosses of wheat by partitioning the means and variances of six basic generations from each cross into their genetic components to assess the gene action governing the inheritance of this trait. Metribuzin tolerance was measured by a visual senescence score 21 days after treatment. The wheat 90 K iSelect SNP genotyping assay was used to identify the distribution of alleles at SNP sites in tolerant and susceptible groups."
"31664905","abstracttext_results","The scaling and joint-scaling tests indicated that the inheritance of metribuzin tolerance in wheat was adequately described by the additive-dominance model, with additive gene action the most significant factor for tolerance. The potence ratio for all the crosses ranged between - 1 and + 1 for senescence under metribuzin-treated conditions indicating a semi-dominant gene action in the inheritance of metribuzin tolerance in wheat. The number of segregating genes governing metribuzin tolerance was estimated between 3 and 15. The consistent high heritability range (0.82 to 0.92) in F 5-7 generations of Chuan Mai 25 (tolerant) × Ritchie (susceptible) cross indicated a significant contribution of additive genetic effects to metribuzin tolerance in wheat. Several genes related to photosynthesis (e.g. photosynthesis system II assembly factor YCF48), metabolic detoxification of xenobiotics and cell growth and development (cytochrome P450, glutathione S-transferase, glycosyltransferase, ATP-binding cassette transporters and glutathione peroxidase) were identified on different chromosomes (2A, 2D, 3B, 4A, 4B, 7A, 7B, 7D) governing metribuzin tolerance."
"31664905","abstracttext_conclusions","The simple additive-dominance gene effects for metribuzin tolerance will help breeders to select tolerant lines in early generations and the identified genes may guide the development of functional markers for metribuzin tolerance."

"11999850","abstracttext","Wheat genes are present in physically small, gene-rich regions, interspersed by gene-poor blocks of retrotransposon-like repetitive sequences. One of the largest gene-rich regions is present around fraction length (FL) 0.8 of the short arm of wheat homoeologous group 1 chromosomes and is called '1S0.8 region'. The objective of this study was to reveal the structural and functional organization of the '1S0.8 region' in various Triticeae and other Poaceae species. Consensus genetic linkage maps of the '1S0.8 region' were constructed for wheat, barley, and rye by combining mapping information from 16, 11, and 12 genetic linkage maps, respectively. The consensus genetic linkage maps were compared with each other and with a consensus physical map of wheat homoeologous group 1. Comparative analyses localized 75 agronomically important genes to the '1S0.8 region'. This high-resolution comparison revealed exceptions to the rule of conserved gene synteny, established using low-resolution marker comparisons. Small rearrangements such as duplications, deletions, and inversions were observed among species. Proportion ofchromosomal recombination occurring in the '1S0.8 region' was very similar among species. Within the gene-rich region, the extent of recombination was highly variable but the pattern was similar among species. Relative recombination among markers was similar except for a few loci where drastic differences were observed among species. Chromosomal rearrangements did not always change the extent of recombination for the region. Differences in gene order and relative recombination were the least between wheat and barley, and were the highest between wheat and oat."

"24638930","abstracttext","In crop improvement, the isolation, cloning and transfer of disease resistance genes (R-genes) is an ultimate goal usually starting from tentative R-gene analogs (RGAs) that are identified on the basis of their structure. For bread wheat, recent advances in genome sequencing are supporting the efforts of wheat geneticists worldwide. Among wheat R-genes, nucleotide-binding site (NBS)-encoding ones represent a major class. In this study, we have used a polymerase chain reaction-based approach to amplify and clone NBS-type RGAs from a bread wheat cultivar, 'Salambo 80.' Four novel complete ORF sequences showing similarities to previously reported R-genes/RGAs were used for in silico analyses. In a first step, where analyses were focused on the NBS domain, these sequences were phylogenetically assigned to two distinct groups: a first group close to leaf rust Lr21 resistance proteins; and a second one similar to cyst nematode resistance proteins. In a second step, sequences were used as initial seeds to walk up and downstream the NBS domain. This procedure enabled identifying 8 loci ranging in size between 2,115 and 7,653 bp. Ab initio gene prediction identified 8 gene models, among which two had complete ORFs. While GenBank survey confirmed the belonging of sequences to two groups, subsequent characterization using IWGSC genomic and proteomic data showed that the 8 gene models, reported in this study, were unique and their loci matched scaffolds on chromosome arms 1AS, 1BS, 4BS and 1DS. The gene model located on 1DS is a pseudo-Lr21 that was shown to have an NBS-LRR domain structure, while the potential association of the RGAs, here reported, is discussed. This study has produced novel R-gene-like loci and models in the wheat genome and provides the first steps toward further elucidation of their role in wheat disease resistance."
"24011260","articletitle","Analysing complex Triticeae genomes - concepts and strategies."
"24011260","abstracttext","The genomic sequences of many important Triticeae crop species are hard to assemble and analyse due to their large genome sizes, (in part) polyploid genomes and high repeat content. Recently, the draft genomes of barley and bread wheat were reported thanks to cost-efficient and fast NGS technologies. The genome of barley is estimated to be 5 Gb in size whereas the genome of bread wheat accounts for 17 Gb and harbours an allo-hexaploid genome. Direct assembly of the sequence reads and access to the gene content is hampered by the repeat content. As a consequence, novel strategies and data analysis concepts had to be developed to provide much-needed whole genome sequence surveys and access to the gene repertoires. Here we describe some analytical strategies that now enable structuring of massive NGS data generated and pave the way towards structured and ordered sequence data and gene order. Specifically we report on the GenomeZipper, a synteny driven approach to order and structure NGS survey sequences of grass genomes that lack a physical map. In addition, to access and analyse the gene repertoire of allo-hexaploid bread wheat from the raw sequence reads, a reference-guided approach was developed utilizing representative genes from rice, Brachypodium distachyon, sorghum and barley. Stringent sub-assembly on the reference genes prevented collapsing of homeologous wheat genes and allowed to estimate gene retention rate and determine gene family sizes. Genomic sequences from the wheat sub-genome progenitors enabled to discriminate a large number of sub-assemblies between the wheat A, B or D sub-genome using machine learning algorithms. Many of the concepts outlined here can readily be applied to other complex plant and non-plant genomes."
"24269602","articletitle","Monodehydroascorbate reductase gene, regulated by the wheat PN-2013 miRNA, contributes to adult wheat plant resistance to stripe rust through ROS metabolism."
"24269602","abstracttext","Wheat stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most destructive wheat diseases worldwide. Varieties with adult plant resistance (APR) maintain effective and durable disease resistance. APR to stripe rust in wheat cultivar XZ9104 (XZ) is associated with extensive hypersensitive cell death and production of reactive oxygen species in the host. MDHAR is an important gene in the AsA-GSH cycle, and it plays an important role in maintaining the reduced pool of AsA scavenging hydrogen peroxide. microRNAs (miRNAs) were shown to engage in post-transcriptional regulation by degrading target mRNAs or repressing gene translation in plants responding to abiotic/biotic stresses. Previously, two novel miRNAs (1136-P3 and PN-2013) were isolated in wheat and the target gene of them was determined using degradome sequencing technology. In this study, the target gene was isolated and characterized as TaMDHAR, a monodehydroascorbate reductase gene. We first demonstrated that the target gene could be cleaved by these two miRNAs in tobacco leaves experimentally. However, TaMDHAR was regulated by PN-2013, not 1136-P3, in wheat-Pst adult incompatible interaction according to the expression patterns. The TaMDHAR knockdown resulted in improved wheat resistance to Pst at the seedling stage, with no influence on 1136-P3 and PN-2013 expression. The TaMDHAR knockdown resulted in a much greater H2O2 accumulation and lower APX and CAT activities together with higher expression in several PR genes. We deduced that TaMDHAR could contribute to the APR of XZ through ROS metabolism as regulated by the AsA-GSH cycle."

"27994192","abstracttext","A pair of stripe rust and leaf rust resistance genes was introgressed from Aegilops caudata, a nonprogenitor diploid species with the CC genome, to cultivated wheat. Inheritance and genetic mapping of stripe rust resistance gene in backcrossrecombinant inbred line (BC-RIL) population derived from the cross of a wheat-Ae. caudata introgression line (IL) T291- 2(pau16060) with wheat cv. PBW343 is reported here. Segregation of BC-RILs for stripe rust resistance depicted a single major gene conditioning adult plant resistance (APR) with stripe rust reaction varying from TR-20MS in resistant RILs signifying the presence of some minor genes as well. Genetic association with leaf rust resistance revealed that two genes are located at a recombination distance of 13%. IL T291-2 had earlier been reported to carry introgressions on wheat chromosomes 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D, 6D and 7D. Genetic mapping indicated the introgression of stripe rust resistance gene on wheat chromosome 5DS in the region carrying leaf rust resistance gene LrAc, but as an independent introgression. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers designed from the survey sequence data of 5DS enriched the target region harbouring stripe and leaf rust resistance genes. Stripe rust resistance locus, temporarily designated as YrAc, mapped at the distal most end of 5DS linked with a group of four colocated SSRs and two resistance gene analogue (RGA)-STS markers at a distance of 5.3 cM. LrAc mapped at a distance of 9.0 cM from the YrAc and at 2.8 cM from RGA-STS marker Ta5DS_2737450, YrAc and LrAc appear to be the candidate genes for marker-assisted enrichment of the wheat gene pool for rust resistance."

The B-genome-encoded alpha-gliadin genes, however, contain very few epitopes. Controlling alpha-gliadin gene expression in wheat requires knowledge on the processes of expression and deposition of alpha-gliadin protein during wheat grain development."
"18621967","abstracttext_methods","A 592-bp fragment of the promotor of a B-genome-encoded alpha-gliadin gene driving the expression of a GUS reporter gene was transformed into wheat. A large number of transgenic lines were used for data collection. GUS staining was used to determine GUS expression during wheat kernel development, and immunogold labelling and tissue printing followed by staining with an alpha-gliadin-specific antibody was used to detect alpha-gliadin protein deposited in developing wheat kernels. The promoter sequence was screened for regulatory motifs and compared to other available alpha-gliadin promoter sequences."
"18621967","abstracttext_key results","GUS expression was detected primarily in the cells of the starchy endosperm, notably in the subaleurone layer but also in the aleurone layer. The alpha-gliadin promoter was active from 11 days after anthesis (DAA) until maturity, with an expression similar to that of a 326-bp low molecular weight (LMW) subunit gene promoter reported previously. An alpha-gliadin-specific antibody detected alpha-gliadin protein in protein bodies in the starchy endosperm and in the subaleurone layer but, in contrast to the promoter activity, no alpha-gliadin was detected in the aleurone cell layer. Sequence comparison showed differences in regulatory elements between the promoters of alpha-gliadin genes originating from different genomes (A and B) of bread wheat both in the region used here and upstream."
"18621967","abstracttext_conclusions","The results suggest that additional regulator elements upstream of the promoter region used may specifically repress expression in the aleurone cell layer.

"22726208","abstracttext_background","A complete assembled genome sequence of wheat is not yet available. Therefore, model plant systems for wheat are very valuable. Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium) is such a system. The WRKY family of transcription factors is one of the most important families of plant transcriptional regulators with members regulating important agronomic traits. Studies of WRKY transcription factors in Brachypodium and wheat therefore promise to lead to new strategies for wheat improvement."
"22726208","abstracttext_results","We have identified and manually curated the WRKY transcription factor family from Brachypodium using a pipeline designed to identify all potential WRKY genes. 86 WRKY transcription factors were found, a total higher than all other current databases. We therefore propose that our numbering system (BdWRKY1-BdWRKY86) becomes the standard nomenclature. In the JGI v1.0 assembly of Brachypodium with the MIPS/JGI v1.0 annotation, nine of the transcription factors have no gene model and eleven gene models are probably incorrectly predicted. In total, twenty WRKY transcription factors (23.3%) do not appear to have accurate gene models. To facilitate use of our data, we have produced The Database of Brachypodium distachyon WRKY Transcription Factors. Each WRKY transcription factor has a gene page that includes predicted protein domains from MEME analyses. These conserved protein domains reflect possible input and output domains in signaling. The database also contains a BLAST search function where a large dataset of WRKY transcription factors, published genes, and an extensive set of wheat ESTs can be searched. We also produced a phylogram containing the WRKY transcription factor families from Brachypodium, rice, Arabidopsis, soybean, and Physcomitrella patens, together with published WRKY transcription factors from wheat. This phylogenetic tree provides evidence for orthologues, co-orthologues, and paralogues of Brachypodium WRKY transcription factors."

"27125388","abstracttext_main conclusion","A novel broad-spectrum powdery mildew resistance gene PmPB74 was identified in wheat- Agropyron cristatum introgression line Pubing 74. Development of wheat cultivars with broad-spectrum, durable resistance to powdery mildew has been restricted by lack of superior genetic resources. In this study, a wheat-A. cristatum introgression line Pubing 74, originally selected from a wide cross between the common wheat cultivar Fukuhokomugi (Fukuho) and Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn (2n = 4x = 28; genome PPPP), displayed resistance to powdery mildew at both the seedling and adult stages. The putative alien chromosomal fragment in Pubing 74 was below the detection limit of genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), but evidence for other non-GISH-detectable introgressions was provided by the presence of three STS markers specific to A. cristatum. Genetic analysis indicated that Pubing 74 carried a single dominant gene for powdery mildew resistance, temporarily designated PmPB74. Molecular mapping showed that PmPB74 was located on wheat chromosome arm 5DS, and flanked by markers Xcfd81 and HRM02 at genetic distances of 2.5 and 1.7 cM, respectively. Compared with other lines with powdery mildew resistance gene(s) on wheat chromosome arm 5DS, Pubing 74 was resistant to all 28 Blumeria graminis f. sp tritici (Bgt) isolates from different wheat-producing regions of northern China. Allelism tests indicated that PmPB74 was not allelic to PmPB3558 or Pm2. Our work showed that PmPB74 is a novel gene with broad resistance to powdery mildew, and hence will be helpful in broadening the genetic basis of powdery mildew resistance in wheat."

"28837844","abstracttext","Wheat leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina (Pt), is one of the most severe fungal diseases on wheat globally. Rational utilization of wheat leaf rust resistance (Lr) genes is still the best choice for control this disease. Wheat seedlings carrying Lr19 showed a high resistance phenotype to all Pt races in China. So far, all the cloned seedling Lr genes including Lr1, Lr10 and Lr21, encode protein with NBS-LRR domain. In this study, a wheat gene with NBS-LRR domain from previously established Lr19-resistance-related cDNA library was cloned and designated as TaRGA19. Full length of this gene was amplified by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). By blast against IWGSC wheat genome database, we have noticed that TaRGA19 was located on chromosome 2DS, which was different from Lr19 located on chromosome 7DL. Compared with susceptible Thatcher line, expression level of TaRGA19 was upregulated in wheat isogenic lines carrying Lr19 (TcLr19) after inoculation of Pt race THTS. By particle bombardment, TaRGA19-GFP fused protein was localized on plasma membrane of epidermal cells. Using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), TaRGA19-knockdown plants of TcLr19 showed reduced resistance and few sporulation phenotype upon Pt challenge. Further histological observation indicated that Pt hyphal growth at the infection sites was less suppressed in the TaRGA19-knockdown plants. In conclusion, we speculate this TaRGA19 gene was involved in the Lr19-mediated resistance to wheat leaf rust along with other components."

"19395588","abstracttext","Together maize, Sorghum, rice, and wheat grass (Poaceae) species are the most important cereal crops in the world and exhibit different ""grain endosperm texture."" This trait has been studied extensively in wheat because of its pivotal role in determining quality of products obtained from wheat grain. Grain softness protein-1 and Puroindolines A and B (grain storage proteins), encoded by Ha-like genes: Gsp-1, Pina, and Pinb, of the Hardness (Ha) locus, are the main determinants of the grain softness/hardness trait in wheat. The origin and evolution of grain endosperm texture in grasses was addressed by comparing genomic sequences of the Ha orthologous region of wheat, Brachypodium, rice, and Sorghum. Results show that the Ha-like genes are present in wheat and Brachypodium but are absent from Sorghum bicolor. A truncated remnant of an Ha-like gene is present in rice. Synteny analysis of the genomes of these grass species shows that only one of the paralogous Ha regions, created 70 My by whole-genome duplication, contained Ha-like genes. The comparative genome analysis and evolutionary comparison with genes encoding grain reserve proteins of grasses suggest that an ancestral Ha-like gene emerged, as a new member of the prolamin gene family, in a common ancestor of the Pooideae (Triticeae and Brachypoidieae tribes) and Ehrhartoideae (rice), between 60 and 50 My, after their divergence from Panicoideae (Sorghum). It was subsequently lost in Ehrhartoideae. Recurring duplications, deletions, and/or truncations occurred independently and appear to characterize Ha-like gene evolution in the grass species. The Ha-like genes gained a new function in Triticeae, such as wheat, underlying the soft grain phenotype. Loss of these genes in some wheat species leads, in turn, to hard endosperm seeds."

Use of triticale lines with various wheat chromosome substitutions confirmed the chromosomal origin of the rye-specific marker. The presence of the 473-bp PCR product was always associated with the production of 75K secalins in grain samples.

The TaGluD protein was overexpressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. After refolding and purification, TaGluD with 1 unit of beta-1,3-glucanase showed antifungal activity in vitro against Rhizoctonia solani, R. cerealis, Phytophthora capsici and Alternaria longipes with inhibition rates of 42%, 43%, 32% and 30%, respectively. Thus TaGluD may be useful for enhancing fungal resistance in several crop species."

"17600208","abstracttext","Wheat was domesticated about 10,000 years ago and has since spread worldwide to become one of the major crops. Its adaptability to diverse environments and end uses is surprising given the diversity bottlenecks expected from recent domestication and polyploid speciation events. Wheat compensates for these bottlenecks by capturing part of the genetic diversity of its progenitors and by generating new diversity at a relatively fast pace. Frequent gene deletions and disruptions generated by a fast replacement rate of repetitive sequences are buffered by the polyploid nature of wheat, resulting in subtle dosage effects on which selection can operate."

"24997977","abstracttext","The virus-derived small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) of Chinese wheat mosaic virus (CWMV), a member of the genus Furovirus, were characterised from wheat plants by deep sequencing. CWMV vsiRNAs of 21-22 nt in length predominated, suggesting that there might be a conserved mechanism of DCL2 and DCL4 involvement in the biogenesis of vsiRNAs, as well as a common RNA silencing pathway in CWMV-infected wheat plants. The 5'-terminal base of vsiRNAs was biased towards A/U, suggesting that CWMV vsiRNAs might be loaded into diverse AGO-containing RISCs to disturb the gene expression of host plants. Possible targets for some of the vsiRNAs were predicted."

"27795210","abstracttext","Identification of causal mutations in barley and wheat is hampered by their large genomes and suppressed recombination. To overcome these obstacles, we have developed MutChromSeq, a complexity reduction approach based on flow sorting and sequencing of mutant chromosomes, to identify induced mutations by comparison to parental chromosomes. We apply MutChromSeq to six mutants each of the barley Eceriferum-q gene and the wheat Pm2 genes. This approach unambiguously identified single candidate genes that were verified by Sanger sequencing of additional mutants. MutChromSeq enables reference-free forward genetics in barley and wheat, thus opening up their pan-genomes to functional genomics."

"31043759","abstracttext","Introgression is a potential source of beneficial genetic diversity. The contribution of introgression to adaptive evolution and improvement of wheat as it was disseminated worldwide remains unknown. We used targeted re-sequencing of 890 diverse accessions of hexaploid and tetraploid wheat to identify wild-relative introgression. Introgression, and selection for improvement and environmental adaptation, each reduced deleterious allele burden. Introgression increased diversity genome wide and in regions harboring major agronomic genes, and contributed alleles explaining a substantial proportion of phenotypic variation. These results suggest that historic gene flow from wild relatives made a substantial contribution to the adaptive diversity of modern bread wheat."

"24692648","abstracttext","Carotenoid content is a primary determinant of wheat nutritional value and affects its end-use quality. Wheat grains contain very low carotenoid levels and trace amounts of provitamin A content. In order to enrich the carotenoid content in wheat grains, the bacterial phytoene synthase gene (CrtB) and carotene desaturase gene (CrtI) were transformed into the common wheat cultivar Bobwhite. Expression of CrtB or CrtI alone slightly increased the carotenoid content in the grains of transgenic wheat, while co-expression of both genes resulted in a darker red/yellow grain phenotype, accompanied by a total carotenoid content increase of approximately 8-fold achieving 4.76 μg g(-1) of seed dry weight, a β-carotene increase of 65-fold to 3.21 μg g(-1) of seed dry weight, and a provitamin A content (sum of α-carotene, β-carotene, and β-cryptoxanthin) increase of 76-fold to 3.82 μg g(-1) of seed dry weight. The high provitamin A content in the transgenic wheat was stably inherited over four generations. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that enhancement of provitamin A content in transgenic wheat was also a result of the highly coordinated regulation of endogenous carotenoid biosynthetic genes, suggesting a metabolic feedback regulation in the wheat carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. These transgenic wheat lines are not only valuable for breeding wheat varieties with nutritional benefits for human health but also for understanding the mechanism regulating carotenoid biosynthesis in wheat endosperm."

A wheat endosperm cDNA library was subsequently constructed in λgt11 and six clones hybridising to the cDNA insert of clone WL : AGA.1 were isolated. The longest of these wheat endosperm ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase cDNAs, clone WE : AGA.7, is nearly full-length (1798 bp), indicated by Northern blot analysis of wheat endosperm mRNA and nucleotide sequence analysis.Southern hybridisation analysis and restriction enzyme mapping indicated that the wheat leaf and wheat endosperm ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase cDNAs and genes are members of two distinct gene families. In addition, restriction enzyme mapping revealed polymorphism in the wheat endosperm ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase cDNAs, indicating the existence of at least two wheat endosperm ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase gene sub-families.Subsequent nucleotide sequence analysis indicates that there is approximately 55% identity between wheat leaf and wheat endosperm ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase cDNAs. In contrast, members of each sub-family of endosperm cDNA, represented by clones WE : AGA.3 and WE : AGA.7, are 96% identical."

"32685983","abstracttext_key message","Three genes designated DvLox, Pm21#4, and Pm21#4-H identified in a wheat-Dasypyrum villosum#4 T6V#4S·6DL translocation line Pm97033 conferred wheat for powdery mildew resistance. Powdery mildew (PM) caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) is one of the most devastating diseases in wheat. To date, only a few genes conferring resistance to wheat PM are cloned. Dasypyrum villosum is a wild relative of wheat, which provides Pm21 conferring wheat immunity to PM. In this study, we obtained many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from a wheat-D. villosum#4 T6V#4S·6DL translocation line Pm97033 using RNA-sequencing. Among them, 7 DEGs associated with pathogen resistance were up-regulated in front of Bgt infection. Virus-induced gene silencing and transformation assays demonstrated that two of them, DvLox and Pm21#4 encoding a lipoxygenase and a encoding coiled-coil/nucleotide-binding site/leucine-rich repeat resistance protein, conferred wheat PM resistance. The transgenic wheat plants expressing DvLox enhanced PM resistance, and the transgenic wheat plants expressing Pm21#4 showed PM immunity. The Pm21#4-silenced Pm97033 plants by the cluster regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated endonuclease (CRISPR/Cas9) system were susceptible to PM. Thus, Pm21#4 is a key gene contributing PM immune resistance in Pm97033. Constitutively expression of Pm21#4-H, which is silenced in Pm97033 and D. villosum#4, endowed a PM-susceptible wheat variety Fielder with PM immune resistance."

"30781176","abstracttext","High yield potential and the wide adaptability of wheat-rye T1BL·1RS translocation lines are attractive to breeders. The wheat-rye lines Lankao 1, 3, 4, and 5 were resistant to a wide spectrum of wheat powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici) isolates from both China and Canada. They also were resistant to a mixture of wheat stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) pathotypes (98WSR) and wheat stripe rust (P. striiformis f. sp. tritici) races from western Canada and China. Colonization of wheat curl mite (WCM) (Aceria tosichella) resulted in slower development of rolling and trapping leaves in the Lankao lines than in the WCM-susceptible check cultivars. The delayed development of Wheat streak mosaic (WSM) symptoms on Lankao lines was observed when transmitted by viruliferous WCM, even though they were susceptible to Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV). This effect of Lankao lines on limiting the spread of WSM was comparable with other known sources of WCM resistance. Sequential C-banding and genomic in situ hybridization analyses revealed the presence of a pair of T1BL·1RS translocated chromosomes in the Lankao lines. Segregation analysis of the F 2 progeny plants derived from crosses between Lankao 4 and the susceptible wheat cvs. Mingxian 169 and Lovrin 13 indicated that a single dominant gene was responsible for the isolate-specific resistance against wheat powdery mildew in Lankao 4. Polymerase chain reaction analysis using an STS marker amplified rye chromatin in powdery mildew-resistant and -susceptible F 2 plants of the Mingxian 169 × Lankao 4 cross demonstrated that the resistance of Lankao 4 was not controlled by a gene or genes located on the rye chromosome arm of T1BL·1RS. The resistance of the Lankao lines to diseases and limitation of the spread of WSMV, in combination with good quality and high yield potential, makes them useful for wheat improvement and production."

"29238352","abstracttext","The APETALA 2/Ethylene-responsive element binding factor (AP2/ERF) transcription factor gene family is widely involved in the biotic and abiotic stress regulation. Haynaldia villosa (VV, 2 n = 14), a wild species of wheat, is a potential gene pool for wheat improvement. H. villosa confers high resistance to several wheat diseases and high tolerance to some abiotic stress. In this study, ERF1-V , an ethylene-responsive element-binding factor gene of the AP2/ERF transcription factor gene family from wild H. villosa , was cloned and characterized. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis showed that ERF1-V is a deduced B2 type ERF gene. ERF1-V was first identified as a Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici ( Bgt) up-regulated gene, and later found to be induced by drought, salt and cold stresses. In responses to hormones, ERF1-V was up-regulated by ethylene and abscisic acid, but down-regulated by salicylic acid and jasmonic acid. Over expression of ERF1-V in wheat could improve resistance to powdery mildew, salt and drought stress. Chlorophyll content, malondialdehyde content, superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activity were significantly differences between the recipient Yangmai158 and the transgenic plants following salt treatment. Furthermore, the expression levels of some stress responsive genes were differences after drought or salt treatments. Although ERF1-V was activated by the constitutive promoter, the agronomic traits, including flowering time, plant height, effective tiller number, spikelet number per spike and grain size, did not changed significantly. ERF1-V is a valuable gene for wheat improvement by genetic engineering."

"29875781","abstracttext","Improving end-use quality and disease resistance are important goals in wheat breeding. The genetic loci controlling these traits are highly complex, consisting of large families of prolamin and resistance genes with members present in all three homeologous A, B, and D genomes in hexaploid bread wheat. Here, orthologous regions harboring both prolamin and resistance gene loci were reconstructed and compared to understand gene duplication and evolution in different wheat genomes. Comparison of the two orthologous D regions from the hexaploid wheat Chinese Spring and the diploid progenitor Aegilops tauschii revealed their considerable difference due to the presence of five large structural variations with sizes ranging from 100 kb to 2 Mb. As a result, 44% of the Ae. tauschii and 71% of the Chinese Spring sequences in the analyzed regions, including 79 genes, are not shared. Gene rearrangement events, including differential gene duplication and deletion in the A, B, and D regions, have resulted in considerable erosion of gene collinearity in the analyzed regions, suggesting rapid evolution of prolamin and resistance gene families after the separation of the three wheat genomes. We hypothesize that this fast evolution is attributed to the co-evolution of the two gene families dispersed within a high recombination region. The identification of a full set of prolamin genes facilitated transcriptome profiling and revealed that the A genome contributes the least to prolamin expression because of its smaller number of expressed intact genes and their low expression levels, while the B and D genomes contribute similarly."

Although genome-wide identification and analysis of the DOF transcription factor family has been reported in other species, no relevant studies have emerged in wheat. The aim of this study was to investigate the evolutionary and functional characteristics associated with plant growth and abiotic stress responses by genome-wide analysis of the wheat Dof transcription factor gene family."
"32245398","abstracttext_results","Using the recently released wheat genome database (IWGSC RefSeq v1.0), we identified 96 wheat Dof gene family members, which were phylogenetically clustered into five distinct subfamilies. Gene duplication analysis revealed a broad and heterogeneous distribution of TaDofs on the chromosome groups 1 to 7, and obvious tandem duplication genes were present on chromosomes 2 and 3.Members of the same gene subfamily had similar exon-intron structures, while members of different subfamilies had obvious differences. Functional divergence analysis indicated that type-II functional divergence played a major role in the differentiation of the TaDof gene family. Positive selection analysis revealed that the Dof gene family experienced different degrees of positive selection pressure during the process of evolution, and five significant positive selection sites (30A, 31 T, 33A, 102G and 104S) were identified. Additionally, nine groups of coevolving amino acid sites, which may play a key role in maintaining the structural and functional stability of Dof proteins, were identified. The results from the RNA-seq data and qRT-PCR analysis revealed that TaDof genes exhibited obvious expression preference or specificity in different organs and developmental stages, as well as in diverse abiotic stress responses. Most TaDof genes were significantly upregulated by heat, PEG and heavy metal stresses."

"32677889","abstracttext_background","Polyploid organisms such as wheat complicate even the simplest of procedures in molecular biology. Whilst knowledge of genomic sequences in crops is increasing rapidly, the scientific community is still a long way from producing a full pan-genome for every species. Polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing therefore remain widely used as methods for characterizing gene sequences in many varieties of crops. High sequence similarity between genomes in polyploids means that if primers are not homeologue-specific via the incorporation of a SNP at the 3' tail, sequences other than the target sequence will also be amplified. Current consensus for gene cloning in wheat is to manually perform many steps in a long bioinformatics pipeline."
"32677889","abstracttext_results","Here we present AutoCloner ( www.autocloner.com ), a fully automated pipeline for crop gene cloning that includes a free-to-use web interface for users. AutoCloner takes a sequence of interest from the user and performs a basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) search against the genome assembly for their particular polyploid crop. Homologous sequences are then compiled with the input sequence into a multiple sequence alignment which is mined for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Various combinations of potential primers that cover the entire gene of interest are then created and evaluated by Primer3; the set of primers with the highest score, as well as all possible primers at every SNP location, are then returned to the user for polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We have successfully used AutoCloner to clone various genes of interest in the Apogee wheat variety, which has no current genome sequence.

"31955232","abstracttext_key message","A physical map of Secale cereale chromosome 6R was constructed using deletion mapping, and a new stripe rust resistance gene Yr83 was mapped to the deletion bin of FL 0.73-1.00 of 6RL. Rye (Secale cereale L., RR) possesses valuable genes for wheat improvement. In the current study, we report a resistance gene conferring stripe rust resistance effective from seedling to adult plant stages located on chromosome 6R. This chromosome was derived from triticale line T-701 and also carries highly effective resistance to the cereal cyst nematode species Heterodera avenae Woll. A wheat-rye 6R(6D) disomic substitution line exhibited high levels of seedling resistance to Australian pathotypes of the stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici; Pst) pathogen and showed an even greater resistance to the Chinese Pst pathotypes in the field. Ten chromosome 6R deletion lines and five wheat-rye 6R translocation lines were developed earlier in the attempt to transfer the nematode resistance gene to wheat and used herein to map the stripe rust resistance gene. These lines were subsequently characterized by sequential multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (mc-FISH), genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), mc-GISH, PCR-based landmark unique gene (PLUG), and chromosome 6R-specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-Seq) marker analyses to physically map the stripe rust resistance gene. The new stripe rust resistance locus was located in a chromosomal bin with fraction length (FL) 0.73-1.00 on 6RL and was named Yr83. A wheat-rye translocation line T6RL (#5) carrying the stripe rust resistance gene will be useful as a new germplasm in breeding for resistance."
"31254024","articletitle","Identification of a candidate gene for a QTL for spikelet number per spike on wheat chromosome arm 7AL by high-resolution genetic mapping."
"31254024","abstracttext_key message","A high-resolution genetic map combined with haplotype analyses identified a wheat ortholog of rice gene APO1 as the best candidate gene for a 7AL locus affecting spikelet number per spike. A better understanding of the genes controlling differences in wheat grain yield components can accelerate the improvements required to satisfy future food demands. In this study, we identified a promising candidate gene underlying a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on wheat chromosome arm 7AL regulating spikelet number per spike (SNS). We used large heterogeneous inbred families ( > 10,000 plants) from two crosses to map the 7AL QTL to an 87-kb region (674,019,191-674,106,327 bp, RefSeq v1.0) containing two complete and two partial genes. In this region, we found three major haplotypes that were designated as H1, H2 and H3. The H2 haplotype contributed the high-SNS allele in both H1 × H2 and H2 × H3 segregating populations. The ancestral H3 haplotype is frequent in wild emmer (48%) but rare (~ 1%) in cultivated wheats. By contrast, the H1 and H2 haplotypes became predominant in modern cultivated durum and common wheat, respectively. Among the four candidate genes, only TraesCS7A02G481600 showed a non-synonymous polymorphism that differentiated H2 from the other two haplotypes. This gene, designated here as WHEAT ORTHOLOG OF APO1 (WAPO1), is an ortholog of the rice gene ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1 (APO1), which affects spikelet number. Taken together, the high-resolution genetic map, the association between polymorphisms in the different mapping populations with differences in SNS, and the known role of orthologous genes in other grass species suggest that WAPO-A1 is the most likely candidate gene for the 7AL SNS QTL among the four genes identified in the candidate gene region."

"31697221","abstracttext","The ToxA - Tsn1 system is an example of an inverse gene-for-gene relationship. The gene ToxA encodes a host-selective toxin (HST) which functions as a necrotrophic effector and is often responsible for the virulence of the pathogen. The genomes of several fungal pathogens (e.g., Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, Parastagonospora nodorum, and Bipolaris sorokiniana ) have been shown to carry the ToxA gene. Tsn1 is a sensitivity gene in the host, whose presence generally helps a ToxA -positive pathogen to cause spot blotch in wheat. Cultivars lacking Tsn1 are generally resistant to spot blotch; this resistance is attributed to a number of other known genes which impart resistance in the absence of Tsn1 . In the present study, 110 isolates of B. sorokiniana strains, collected from the ME 5 A and ME 4 C megaenvironments of India, were screened for the presence of the ToxA gene; 77 (70%) were found to be ToxA positive. Similarly, 220 Indian wheat cultivars were screened for the presence of the Tsn1 gene; 81 (36.8%) were found to be Tsn1 positive. When 20 wheat cultivars (11 with Tsn1 and 9 with tsn1 ) were inoculated with ToxA -positive isolates, seedlings of only those carrying the Tsn1 allele (not tsn1 ) developed necrotic spots surrounded by a chlorotic halo. No such distinction between Tsn1 and tsn1 carriers was observed when adult plants were inoculated. This study suggests that the absence of Tsn1 facilitated resistance against spot blotch of wheat. Therefore, the selection of wheat genotypes for the absence of the Tsn1 allele can improve resistance to spot blotch."

"25078057","abstracttext","Genetic characterization of a new powdery mildew resistance gene in a common wheat line ATRI3004/79 was conducted by employing a set of Blumeria graminis tritici isolates collected from Europe.

Allelism tests of the F2 and F3 populations with other previously known genes on 1A showed that the resistance gene in ATRI3004/79 is closely linked to the Pm3d resistance gene in the German cultivar Syros, whereas it segregated independently from Pm25. Based on its distinct disease response pattern and close linkage to the Pm3 locus, this new resistance gene is tentatively designated PmH1A. A genetic linkage map was constructed for the powdery mildew gene Pm3d, the red glume color gene Rg3, and the gliadin gene Gli-A1 on chromosome 1A, based on data from a F3 population of 120 families derived from the cross Kolibri (Pm3/Gli-A1a/rg3) × F10 Strela (pm3/Gli-A1f/Rg3).

"18943244","abstracttext","Stagonospora nodorum blotch, caused by Phaeosphaeria nodorum, is considered one of the most destructive foliar diseases of wheat in the United States. However, relatively little is known about the population biology of this fungus in the major wheat-growing regions of the central United States. To rectify this situation, 308 single-spore isolates of P. nodorum were analyzed from 12 populations, five from hard red spring wheat cultivars in Minnesota and North Dakota and seven from soft red winter wheat in Indiana and Ohio. The genetic structure of the sampled populations was determined by analyzing polymorphisms at five microsatellite or simple-sequence repeat (SSR) loci and the mating type locus. Although a few clones were identified, most P. nodorum populations had high levels of gene (H(S) = 0.175 to 0.519) and genotype (D = 0.600 to 0.972) diversity. Gene diversity was higher among isolates collected from spring wheat cultivars in North Dakota and Minnesota (mean H(S) = 0.503) than in those from winter wheat cultivars in Indiana and Ohio (H(S) = 0.269). Analyses of clone-corrected data sets showed equal frequencies of both mating types in both regional and local populations, indicating that sexual recombination may occur regularly. However, significant gametic disequilibrium occurred in three of the four populations from North Dakota, and there was genetic differentiation both within and among locations. Genetic differentiation between the hard red spring and soft red winter wheat production regions was moderate (F(ST) = 0.168), but whether this is due to differences in wheat production or to geographical variation cannot be determined. These results suggest that sexual reproduction occurs in P. nodorum populations in the major wheat-growing regions of the central United States, and that geographically separated populations can be genetically differentiated, reflecting either restrictions on gene flow or selection."
"20561246","articletitle","Virus-induced gene silencing of WRKY53 and an inducible phenylalanine ammonia-lyase in wheat reduces aphid resistance."
"20561246","abstracttext","Although several wheat genes differentially expressed during the Russian wheat aphid resistance response have recently been identified, their requirement for and specific role in resistance remain unclear. Progress in wheat-aphid interaction research is hampered by inadequate collections of mutant germplasm and difficulty in transforming hexaploid wheat. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) technology is emerging as a viable reverse genetics approach in cereal crops. However, the potential of VIGS for determining aphid defence gene function in wheat has not been evaluated. We report on the use of recombinant barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) to target and silence a WRKY53 transcription factor and an inducible phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) gene, both predicted to contribute to aphid defence in a genetically resistant wheat line. After inoculating resistant wheat with the VIGS constructs, transcript abundance was reduced to levels similar to that observed in susceptible wheat. Notably, the level of PAL expression was also suppressed by the WKRY53 construct, suggesting that these genes operate in the same defence response network. Both knockdowns exhibited a susceptible phenotype upon aphid infestation, and aphids feeding on silenced plants exhibited a significant increase in fitness compared to aphids feeding on control plants. Altered plant phenotype and changes in aphid behaviour after silencing imply that WKRY53 and PAL play key roles in generating a successful resistance response. This study is the first report on the successful use of VIGS to investigate genes involved in wheat-insect interactions."

"31215411","abstracttext_background","Environmental toxicity from non-essential heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd), which is released from human activities and other environmental causes, is rapidly increasing. Wheat can accumulate high levels of Cd in edible tissues, which poses a major hazard to human health. It has been reported that heat shock transcription factor A 4a (HsfA4a) of wheat and rice conferred Cd tolerance by upregulating metallothionein gene expression. However, genome-wide identification, classification, and comparative analysis of the Hsf family in wheat is lacking. Further, because of the promising role of Hsf genes in Cd tolerance, there is need for an understanding of the expression of this family and their functions on wheat under Cd stress. Therefore, here we identify the wheat TaHsf family and to begin to understand the molecular mechanisms mediated by the Hsf family under Cd stress."
"31215411","abstracttext_results","We first identified 78 putative Hsf homologs using the latest available wheat genome information, of which 38 belonged to class A, 16 to class B and 24 to class C subfamily. Then, we determined chromosome localizations, gene structures, conserved protein motifs, and phylogenetic relationships of these TaHsfs. Using RNA sequencing data over the course of development, we surveyed expression profiles of these TaHsfs during development and under different abiotic stresses to characterise the regulatory network of this family. Finally, we selected 13 TaHsf genes for expression level verification under Cd stress using qRT-PCR."
"31215411","abstracttext_conclusions","To our knowledge, this is the first report of the genome organization, evolutionary features and expression profiles of the wheat Hsf gene family. This work therefore lays the foundation for targeted functional analysis of wheat Hsf genes, and contributes to a better understanding of the roles and regulatory mechanism of wheat Hsfs under Cd stress."

"30069594","abstracttext_key message","Fluorescence in situ hybridization with probes for 45 cDNAs and five tandem repeats revealed homoeologous relationships of Agropyron cristatum with wheat. The results will contribute to alien gene introgression in wheat improvement. Crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum L. Gaertn.) is a wild relative of wheat and a promising source of novel genes for wheat improvement. To date, identification of A. cristatum chromosomes has not been possible, and its molecular karyotype has not been available. Furthermore, homoeologous relationship between the genomes of A. cristatum and wheat has not been determined. To develop chromosome-specific landmarks, A. cristatum genomic DNA was sequenced, and new tandem repeats were discovered. Their distribution on mitotic chromosomes was studied by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which revealed specific patterns for five repeats in addition to 5S and 45S ribosomal DNA and rye subtelomeric repeats pSc119.2 and pSc200. FISH with one tandem repeat together with 45S rDNA enabled identification of all A. cristatum chromosomes. To analyze the structure and cross-species homoeology of A. cristatum chromosomes with wheat, probes for 45 mapped wheat cDNAs covering all seven chromosome groups were localized by FISH. Thirty-four cDNAs hybridized to homoeologous chromosomes of A. cristatum, nine hybridized to homoeologous and non-homoeologous chromosomes, and two hybridized to unique positions on non-homoeologous chromosomes. FISH using single-gene probes revealed that the wheat-A. cristatum collinearity was distorted, and important structural rearrangements were observed for chromosomes 2P, 4P, 5P, 6P and 7P. Chromosomal inversions were found for pericentric region of 4P and whole chromosome arm 6PL. Furthermore, reciprocal translocations between 2PS and 4PL were detected. These results provide new insights into the genome evolution within Triticeae and will facilitate the use of crested wheatgrass in alien gene introgression into wheat."

"30708856","abstracttext","Sugarcane yellow leaf virus (ScYLV) causes severe leaf symptoms in sugarcane (Saccharum spp.). It is a single-stranded RNA virus assigned to the genus Polerovirus, family Luteoviridae (1). ScYLV is transmitted by two aphid species, Melanaphis sacchari and Rhopalosiphum maidis. Although barley (Hordeum vulgare), oats (Avena sativa), and wheat (Triticum spp.) are susceptible to ScYLV when experimentally inoculated (3), this virus, related serologically to Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV)-RPV (4), has never been detected naturally in these cereals. In this study, 240 barley leaves were randomly collected from six fields in Tunisia following a north-south trend during the high infestation periods (March/April) in the 2013 growing season. Samples were tested by DAS-ELISA, using three antibodies (Bioreba AG, Switzerland), two of them, BYDV-B and BYDV-F, specific to luteoviruses corresponding to BYDV-PAV and BYDV-MAV, respectively, and the third one, BYDV-RPV, specific to the polerovirus synonymous to Cereal yellow dwarf virus (CYDV)-RPV. Based on DAS-ELISA, 30 samples were found positive for B/CYDV infection; 17 out of the 30 infected samples contained a single serotype, BYDV-PAV, and 13 out of the 30 infected samples contained two serotypes, PAV and RPV. Total RNA was extracted from all positive samples, and RT-PCR of the viral CP gene was performed with Lu1/Lu4 primers (2). A product of 531 bp was cloned and sequenced. The identities among the sequences determined varied between 80 to 100%, and from the 17 samples containing BYDV-PAV, six distinct BYDV-PAV sequences were revealed and named PAV-TN1 to PAV-TN6 (GenBank Accession No. JX402453 to JX402457 and KF271792). Fortuitously, all 13 positive samples corresponding to the serotypes PAV-RPV exhibited 98.7 to 99.3% identity with ScYLV isolates. These 13 samples contained three distinct sequences that were named ScYLV-Tun1 to ScYLV-Tun3 (GenBank Accession No. KF836888 to KF836890). Of the 17 PAV-positive samples collected, six were infected with PAV-TN1, four with PAV-TN2, four with PAV-TN3, one with PAV-TN4, one with PAV-TN5, and the last one with PAV-TN6. Of the 13 ScYLV-positive samples, seven were infected with ScYLV-Tun1, four with ScYLV-Tun2, and two with ScYLV-Tun3. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PAV-TN sequences formed a very tight cluster (>98%) corresponding to BYDV subspecies PAV-II, whereas all three Tunisian ScYLV sequences were clustered together. This study provides the first report of ScYLV isolates infecting barley crops in Tunisia, and confirms serological cross-reactivity between ScYLV and BYDV-RPV when commercial antibodies against BYDV-RPV are used.

"25231182","articletitle","Full-genome identification and characterization of NBS-encoding disease resistance genes in wheat."
"25231182","abstracttext","Host resistance is the most economical, effective and ecologically sustainable method of controlling diseases in crop plants. In bread wheat, despite the high number of resistance loci that have been cataloged to date, only few have been cloned, underlying the need for genomics-guided investigations capable of providing a prompt and acute knowledge on the identity of effective resistance genes that can be used in breeding programs. Proteins with a nucleotide-binding site (NBS) encoded by the major plant disease resistance (R) genes play an important role in the responses of plants to various pathogens. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of NBS-encoding genes within the whole wheat genome was performed, and the genome scale characterization of this gene family was established. From the recently published wheat genome sequence, we used a data mining and automatic prediction pipeline to identify 580 complete ORF candidate NBS-encoding genes and 1,099 partial-ORF ones. Among complete gene models, 464 were longer than 200 aa, among them 436 had less than 70 % of sequence identity to each other. This gene models set was deeply characterized. (1) First, we have analyzed domain architecture and identified, in addition to typical domain combinations, the presence of particular domains like signal peptides, zinc fingers, kinases, heavy-metal-associated and WRKY DNA-binding domains. (2) Functional and expression annotation via homology searches in protein and transcript databases, based on sufficient criteria, enabled identifying similar proteins for 60 % of the studied gene models and expression evidence for 13 % of them. (3) Shared orthologous groups were defined using NBS-domain proteins of rice and Brachypodium distachyon. (4) Finally, alignment of the 436 NBS-containing gene models to the full set of scaffolds from the IWGSC's wheat chromosome survey sequence enabled high-stringence anchoring to chromosome arms. The distribution of the R genes was found balanced on the three wheat sub-genomes. In contrast, at chromosome scale, 50 % of members of this gene family were localized on 6 of the 21 wheat chromosomes and ~22 % of them were localized on homeologous group 7. The results of this study provide a detailed analysis of the largest family of plant disease resistance genes in allohexaploid wheat. Some structural traits reported had not been previously identified and the genome-derived data were confronted with those stored in databases outlining the functional specialization of members of this family. The large reservoir of NBS-type genes presented and discussed will, firstly, form an important framework for marker-assisted improvement of resistance in wheat, and, secondly, open up new perspectives for a better understanding of the evolution dynamics of this gene family in grass species and in polyploid systems."
"11231894","articletitle","A survey of the molecular evolutionary dynamics of twenty-five multigene families from four grass taxa."
"11231894","abstracttext","We surveyed the molecular evolutionary characteristics of 25 plant gene families, with the goal of better understanding general processes in plant gene family evolution. The survey was based on 247 GenBank sequences representing four grass species (maize, rice, wheat, and barley). For each gene family, orthology and paralogy relationships were uncertain. Recognizing this uncertainty, we characterized the molecular evolution of each gene family in four ways. First, we calculated the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (d(N)/d(S)) both on branches of gene phylogenies and across codons. Our results indicated that the d(N)/d(S) ratio was statistically heterogeneous across branches in 17 of 25 (68%) gene families. The vast majority of d(N)/d(S) estimates were <<1.0, suggestive of selective constraint on amino acid replacements, and no estimates were >1.0, either across phylogenetic lineages or across codons. Second, we tested separately for nonsynonymous and synonymous molecular clocks. Sixty-eight percent of gene families rejected a nonsynonymous molecular clock, and 52% of gene families rejected a synonymous molecular clock. Thus, most gene families in this study deviated from clock-like evolution at either synonymous or nonsynonymous sites. Third, we calculated the effective number of codons and the proportion of G+C synonymous sites for each sequence in each gene family. One or both quantities vary significantly within 18 of 25 gene families. Finally, we tested for gene conversion, and only six gene families provided evidence of gene conversion events. Altogether, evolution for these 25 gene families is marked by selective constraint that varies among gene family members, a lack of molecular clock at both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites, and substantial variation in codon usage."
"21755339","articletitle","Identification and mapping of a new powdery mildew resistance gene on chromosome 6D of common wheat."
"21755339","abstracttext","Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most serious wheat diseases. The rapid evolution of the pathogen's virulence, due to the heavy use of resistance genes, necessitates the expansion of resistance gene diversity. The common wheat line D57 is highly resistant to powdery mildew. A genetic analysis using an F(2) population derived from the cross of D57 with the susceptible cultivar Yangmai 158 and the derived F(2:3) lines indicated that D57 carries two dominant powdery mildew resistance genes. Based on mapping information of polymorphic markers identified by bulk segregant analysis, these two genes were assigned to chromosomes 5DS and 6DS. Using the F(2:3) lines that segregated in a single-gene mode, closely linked PCR-based markers were identified for both genes, and their chromosome assignments were confirmed through linkage mapping. The gene on chromosome 5DS was flanked by Xgwm205 and Xmag6176, with a genetic distance of 8.3 cM and 2.8 cM, respectively. This gene was 3.3 cM from a locus mapped by the STS marker MAG6137, converted from the RFLP marker BCD1871, which was 3.5 cM from Pm2. An evaluation with 15 pathogen isolates indicated that this gene and Pm2 were similar in their resistance spectra. The gene on chromosome 6DS was flanked by co-segregating Xcfd80 and Xmag6139 on one side and Xmag6140 on the other, with a genetic distance of 0.7 cM and 2.7 cM, respectively. This is the first powdery mildew resistance gene identified on chromosome 6DS, and plants that carried this gene were highly resistant to all of the 15 tested pathogen isolates. This gene was designated Pm45. The new resistance gene in D57 could easily be transferred to elite cultivars due to its common wheat origin and the availability of closely linked molecular markers."

The usefulness of such SNP panels for studying wheat evolution and domestication has not yet been fully explored and ascertainment bias issues can potentially affect their applicability when studying landraces and tetraploid ancestors of bread wheat. We here evaluate whether population structure and evolutionary history can be assessed in tetraploid landrace wheats using SNP markers previously developed for the analysis of elite cultivars of hexaploid wheat."
"24885044","abstracttext_results","We genotyped more than 100 tetraploid wheat landraces and wild emmer wheat accessions, some of which had previously been screened with SSR markers, for an existing SNP panel and obtained publically available genotypes for the same SNPs for hexaploid wheat varieties and landraces. Results showed that quantification of genetic diversity can be affected by ascertainment bias but that the effects of ascertainment bias can at least partly be alleviated by merging SNPs to haplotypes. Analyses of population structure and genetic differentiation show strong subdivision between the tetraploid wheat subspecies, except for durum and rivet that are not separable. A more detailed population structure of durum landraces could be obtained than with SSR markers. The results also suggest an emmer, rather than durum, ancestry of bread wheat and with gene flow from wild emmer."
"24885044","abstracttext_conclusions","SNP markers developed for elite cultivars show great potential for inferring population structure and can address evolutionary questions in landrace wheat. Issues of marker genome specificity and mapping need, however, to be addressed. Ascertainment bias does not seem to interfere with the ability of a SNP marker system developed for elite bread wheat accessions to detect population structure in other types of wheat."

"30341494","abstracttext_key message","Development of a complete wheat-Thinopyrum junceiforme amphiploid facilitated identification of resistance to multiple pests and abiotic stress derived from the wild species and shed new light on its genome composition. Wheat production is facing numerous challenges from biotic and abiotic stresses. Alien gene transfer has been an effective approach for wheat germplasm enhancement. Thinopyrum junceiforme, also known as sea wheatgrass (SWG), is a distant relative of wheat and a relatively untapped source for wheat improvement. In the present study, we developed a complete amphiploid, 13G819, between emmer wheat and SWG for the first time. Analysis of the chromosome constitution of the wheat-SWG amphiploid by multiple-color genomic in situ hybridization indicated that SWG is an allotetraploid with its J 1 genome closely related to Th. bessarabicum and Th. elongatum, and its J 2 genome was derived from an unknown source. Two SWG-derived perennial wheat lines, 14F3516 and 14F3536, are partial amphiploids and carry 13 SWG chromosomes of mixed J 1 and J 2 genome composition, suggesting cytological instability. We challenged the amphiploid 13G819 with various abiotic and biotic stress treatments together with its emmer wheat parent. Compared to its emmer wheat parent, the amphiploid showed high tolerance to waterlogging, manganese toxicity and salinity, low nitrogen and possibly to heat as well. The amphiploid 13G819 is also highly resistant to the wheat streak mosaic virus (temperature insensitive) and Fusarium head blight. All three amphiploids had solid stems, which confer resistance to wheat stem sawflies. All these traits make SWG an excellent source for improving wheat resistance to diseases and insects and tolerance to abiotic stress."

Gibberellin is also implicated in green-revolution varieties of wheat, but the reduced height of those crops is conferred by defects in the hormone's signalling pathway."

"23052026","articletitle","Development of a multiple bulked segregant analysis (MBSA) method used to locate a new stem rust resistance gene (Sr54) in the winter wheat cultivar Norin 40."
"23052026","abstracttext","An important aspect of studying putative new genes in wheat is determining their position on the wheat genetic map. The primary difficulty in mapping genes is determining which chromosome carries the gene of interest. Several approaches have been developed to address this problem, each with advantages and disadvantages. Here we describe a new approach called multiple bulked segregant analysis (MBSA). A set of 423 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were selected based on profile simplicity, frequency of polymorphism, and distribution across the wheat genome. SSR primers were preloaded in 384-well PCR plates with each primer occupying 16 wells. In practice, 14 wells are reserved for ""mini-bulks"" that are equivalent to four gametes (e.g. two F(2) individuals) comprised of individuals from a segregated population that have a known homozygous genotype for the gene of interest. The remaining two wells are reserved for the parents of the population. Each well containing a mini-bulk can have one of three allele compositions for each SSR: only the allele from one parent, only the allele from the other parent, or both alleles. Simulation experiments were performed to determine the pattern of mini-bulk allele composition that would indicate putative linkage between the SSR in question and the gene of interest. As a test case, MBSA was employed to locate an unidentified stem rust resistance (Sr) gene in the winter wheat cultivar Norin 40. A doubled haploid (DH) population (n = 267) was produced from hybrids of the cross LMPG-6S/Norin 40. The DH population segregated for a single gene (χ (1:1) (2) = 0.093, p = 0.76) for resistance to Puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici race LCBN. Four resistant DH lines were included in each of the 14 mini-bulks for screening. The Sr gene was successfully located to the long arm of chromosome 2D using MBSA. Further mapping confirmed the chromosome location and revealed that the Sr gene was located in a linkage block that may represent an alien translocation. The new Sr gene was designated as Sr54."

"24487945","abstracttext_key message","This manuscript reports a new gene for non-race-specific resistance to stripe rust and molecular markers for incorporating it into wheat cultivars for control of the disease with durable resistance. Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most destructive wheat diseases worldwide. The spring wheat germplasm 'PI 178759' originating from Iraq showed effective resistance to stripe rust in field evaluations over 8 years in Washington state, USA. To map the resistance gene(s), PI 178759 was crossed with 'Avocet Susceptible', and the parents and 176 F2:3 lines were phenotyped in the fields under natural infection and in a greenhouse with selected races of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici. PI 178759 was identified to have high-temperature adult-plant (HTAP) resistance. Resistance gene analog polymorphism and simple sequence repeat techniques were used to identify molecular markers linked to the resistance gene and a chromosome region was mapped using a quantitative trait locus approach. One major gene was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 7B. Flanked by Xwgp5175 and Xbarc32 in a 2.1 cM region, the gene explained 31.8 and 54.7 % of the phenotypic variation in rAUDPC and IT, respectively. Based on genetic distances among markers and allelism tests, the HTAP resistance gene in PI 178759 is different from the previously reported Yr39, Yr52, YrZH84, and YrC591, also located on chromosome 7BL, and is therefore designated as Yr59. The gene and its flanking markers should be useful for developing wheat cultivars with durable resistance."

"25765046","abstracttext_background","One of the reasons hard red winter wheat cultivar 'Duster' (PI 644016) is widely grown in the southern Great Plains is that it confers a consistently high level of resistance to biotype GP of Hessian fly (Hf). However, little is known about the genetic mechanism underlying Hf resistance in Duster. This study aimed to unravel complex structures of the Hf region on chromosome 1AS in wheat by using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) markers and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers."
"25765046","abstracttext_results","Doubled haploid (DH) lines generated from a cross between two winter wheat cultivars, 'Duster' and 'Billings' , were used to identify genes in Duster responsible for effective and consistent resistance to Hf. Segregation in reaction of the 282 DH lines to Hf biotype GP fit a one-gene model. The DH population was genotyped using 2,358 markers developed using the GBS approach. A major QTL, explaining 88% of the total phenotypic variation, was mapped to a chromosome region that spanned 178 cM and contained 205 GBS markers plus 1 SSR marker and 1 gene marker, with 0.86 cM per marker in genetic distance. The analyses of GBS marker sequences and further mapping of SSR and gene markers enabled location of the QTL-containing linkage group on the short arm of chromosome 1A. Comparative mapping of the common markers for the gene for QHf.osu-1A (d) in Duster and the Hf-resistance gene for QHf.osu-1A (74) in cultivar '2174' showed that the two Hf resistance genes are located on the same chromosome arm 1AS, only 11.2 cM apart in genetic distance. The gene at QHf.osu-1A (d) in Duster has been delimited within a 2.7 cM region."
"25765046","abstracttext_conclusion","Two distinct resistance genes exist on the short arm of chromosome 1A as found in the two hard red winter cultivars, 2174 and Duster. Whereas the Hf resistance gene in 2174 is likely allelic to one or more of the previously mapped resistance genes (H9, H10, H11, H16, or H17) in wheat, the gene in Duster is novel and confers a more consistent phenotype than 2174 in response to biotype GP infestation in controlled-environment assays."

"30858234","articletitle","Genetics of Variable Disease Expression Conferred by Inverse Gene-For-Gene Interactions in the Wheat- Parastagonospora nodorum Pathosystem."
"30858234","abstracttext","The wheat- Parastagonospora nodorum pathosystem involves the recognition of pathogen-secreted necrotrophic effectors (NEs) by corresponding wheat NE sensitivity genes. This inverse gene-for-gene recognition leads to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility and ultimately septoria nodorum blotch disease. Here, we used multiple pathogen isolates to individually evaluate the effects of the host gene-NE interactions Tan spot necrosis1 -Stagonospora nodorum ToxinA ( Tsn1 -SnToxA), Stagonospora nodorum necrosis1 -Stagonospora nodorum Toxin1 ( Snn1 -SnTox1), and Stagonospora nodorum necrosis3-B genome homeolog1 -Stagonospora nodorum Toxin3 ( Snn3-B1 -SnTox3), alone and in various combinations, to determine the relative importance of these interactions in causing disease. Genetic analysis of a recombinant inbred wheat population inoculated separately with three P. nodorum isolates, all of which produce all three NEs, indicated that the Tsn1 -SnToxA and Snn3-B1 -SnTox3 interactions contributed to disease caused by all four isolates, but their effects varied and ranged from epistatic to additive. The Snn1 -SnTox1 interaction was associated with increased disease for one isolate, but for other isolates, there was evidence that this interaction inhibited the expression of other host gene-NE interactions. RNA sequencing analysis in planta showed that SnTox1 was differentially expressed between these three isolates after infection. Further analysis of NE gene-knockout isolates showed that the effect of some interactions could be masked or inhibited by other compatible interactions, and the regulation of this occurs at the level of NE gene transcription. Collectively, these results show that the inverse gene-for-gene interactions leading to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility in the wheat- P. nodorum pathosystem vary in their effects depending on the genetic backgrounds of the pathogen and host, and interplay among the interactions is complex and intricately regulated."

"30288667","abstracttext_key message","The homologous genes to OsSUT1-5 in wheat were identified and detailed analysed. TaSUT1 was the predominant sucrose transporter group and it illustrated the genotypic variations towards drought during grain filling. Sucrose transporters (SUT) play crucial roles in wheat stem water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) remobilization to grain. To determine the major functional SUT gene groups in shoot parts of wheat during grain development, drought tolerant varieties, Westonia and Kauz, were investigated in field drought experiments. Fourteen homologous genes to OsSUT1-5 were identified on five homeologous groups, namely TaSUT1_4A, TaSUT1_4B, TaSUT1_4D; TaSUT2_5A, TaSUT2_5B, TaSUT2_5D; TaSUT3_1A, TaSUT3_1D; TaSUT4_6A, TaSUT4_6B, TaSUT4_6D; TaSUT5_2A, TaSUT5_2B, and TaSUT5_2D, and their gene structures were analysed. Wheat plants above the ground were harvested from pre-anthesis to grain maturity and the stem, leaf sheath, rachis, lemma and developing grain were used for analysing TaSUT gene expression. Grain weight, thousand grain weight, kernel number per spike, biomass and stem WSC were characterized. The study showed that among the five TaSUT groups, TaSUT1 was the predominant sucrose transporting group in all organs sampled, and the expression was particularly high in the developing grain. In contrast to TaSUT1, the gene expression levels of TaSUT2, TaSUT3 and TaSUT4 were lower, except for TaSUT3 which showed preferential expression in the lemma before anthesis. The TaSUT5 gene group was very weakly expressed in all tissues. The upregulated gene expression of TaSUT1 Westonia type in stem and grain reveal a crucial role in stem WSC remobilization to grain under drought. The high TaSUT1 gene expression and the significant correlations with thousand grain weight (TGW) and kernel number per spike demonstrated the contribution in Kauz's high grain yield in an irrigated environment and high TGW in Westonia under drought stress. Further molecular level identification is required for gene marker development."

"1339325","abstracttext","The hot-spot region related to length mutations in the chloroplast genome of the wheat group was precisely analyzed at the DNA sequence level. This region, located downstream from the rbcL gene, was highly enriched in A + T, and contained a number of direct and inverted repeats. Many deletions/insertions were observed in the region. In most deletions/insertions of multiple nucleotides, short repeated sequences were found at the mutation points. Furthermore, a pair of short repeated sequences was also observed at the border of the translocated gene. A sequence homologous with ORF512 of tobacco cpDNA was truncated in cpDNAs of the wheat group and found only in the mitochondrial DNA of Ae. crassa, suggesting the inter-organellar translocation of this sequence. Mechanisms that could generate structural alterations of the chloroplast genome in the wheat group are discussed."

"1902143","abstracttext","The nad1 gene encoding subunit I of the respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase is fragmented into five unique-copy coding segments that are scattered over at least 40 kb and interspersed with other genes in the wheat mitochondrial genome. The nad1 segments are flanked by sequences with group II intron features, and transcript analysis demonstrates the presence of correctly spliced mRNAs. RNA editing occurs at sites asymmetrically distributed along the wheat nad1 coding region, and the initiation codon is created by RNA editing. The unusual organization of the wheat nad1 gene is attributed to mitochondrial DNA rearrangements within introns, and a trans-splicing model involving secondary structural interactions between group II-like intron pieces is proposed for its expression."

"7764977","abstracttext","A recombinant chymosin was secreted at high levels using fusion genes with A. oryzae glucoamylase gene (glaA) and a wheat bran solid-state culture system. Two portions of the A. oryzae glucoamylase, one with almost the entire glucoamylase (GA1-603) lacking 9 amino acids at the carboxyl terminal, and the other (GA1-511) lacking the starch binding-domain, were fused in frame with prochymosin cDNA. Western blot analysis indicated that the mature chymosin was released from the secreted fusion protein by autocatalytic processing. The transformant harboring the GA1-511-prochymosin construct showed about 5-fold chymosin production of the transformant in which the chymosin gene was directly expressed under the control of the glaA promoter in submerged culture. Moreover, wheat bran solid-state culture gave about 500-fold higher yield of the chymosin (approximately 150 mg/kg wheat bran) compared with the submerged culture."

"15759864","abstracttext","The cDNA encoding TOM7 (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane subunit 7) like protein in wheat was cloned through RT-PCR, and its genomic DNA fragment was subsequently cloned. This gene was tentatively designated as TaTOM7. It has no intron in the coding region and its product possesses one hydrophobic trans-membrane domain in the middle, and one hydrophilic domain in the N-terminal and C-terminal domain, respectively. The amino acid composition in the trans-membrane domain of the TaTOM7 subunit is highly conserved among plants, animals and fungi. According to the phylogenetic tree, TOM7-like proteins from different species can be classified into three groups, representing plants, animals and fungi respectively. TaTOM7 is a single- or oligo-copy gene in the wheat genome, displaying different expression levels between Ms2 near-isogenic lines in some tissues, suggesting a role of Ms2 in its expression. TaTOM7 was mapped to chromosome group three of wheat."

We investigated both the conservation of microcolinearity and the molecular evolution of genes, including coding and noncoding sequences. Microcolinearity is restricted to two groups of genes (Unknown gene-2, VAMP, BGGP, Gsp-1, and Unknown gene-8 surrounded by several copies of ATPase), almost conserved in rice and barley, but in a different relative position. Highly conserved genes between wheat and rice run along with genes harboring different copy numbers and highly variable sequences between close wheat genomes. The coding sequence evolution appeared to be submitted to heterogeneous selective pressure and intronic sequences analysis revealed that the molecular clock hypothesis is violated in most cases."

"19228999","abstracttext","Stripe rust is a devastating fungal disease that afflicts wheat in many regions of the world. New races of Puccinia striiformis, the pathogen responsible for this disease, have overcome most of the known race-specific resistance genes. We report the map-based cloning of the gene Yr36 (WKS1), which confers resistance to a broad spectrum of stripe rust races at relatively high temperatures (25 degrees to 35 degrees C). This gene includes a kinase and a putative START lipid-binding domain. Five independent mutations and transgenic complementation confirmed that both domains are necessary to confer resistance. Yr36 is present in wild wheat but is absent in modern pasta and bread wheat varieties, and therefore it can now be used to improve resistance to stripe rust in a broad set of varieties."

"19229000","abstracttext","Agricultural crops benefit from resistance to pathogens that endures over years and generations of both pest and crop. Durable disease resistance, which may be partial or complete, can be controlled by several genes. Some of the most devastating fungal pathogens in wheat are leaf rust, stripe rust, and powdery mildew. The wheat gene Lr34 has supported resistance to these pathogens for more than 50 years. Lr34 is now shared by wheat cultivars around the world. Here, we show that the LR34 protein resembles adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporters of the pleiotropic drug resistance subfamily. Alleles of Lr34 conferring resistance or susceptibility differ by three genetic polymorphisms. The Lr34 gene, which functions in the adult plant, stimulates senescence-like processes in the flag leaf tips and edges."

We report here the characterization of CRY gene family in hexaploid wheat. Degenerate PCR amplification of the regions encoding the conserved flavin-binding domain of CRY proteins yielded seven bands, resulting from amplification of CRY1a, CRY1b and CRY2 homologous genes. Assignment of individual amplicons to subgenomes was accomplished by comparing their sequence compositions with those from the ancestor species of wheat. ESTs coding for CRY-DASH like proteins were identified in wheat EST database in GenBank. Southern blot showed that TaCRY1a, TaCRY1b and TaCRY2 are single copy genes. We mapped TaCRY1a and TaCRY2 to chromosomes of homoeologous group 6, TaCRY1b to group 2, and TaCRY-DASH to group 7. Phylogenetic analysis showed that CRY subfamily diversification occurred before the divergence of monocots and dicots. The regulatory and functional changes of CRY members within subfamily are discussed."

"22821939","abstracttext","A novel gene named TaSC was cloned from salt-tolerant wheat. Northern blot showed that the expression of TaSC in salt-tolerant wheat was up-regulated after salt stress. Real-time quantitative PCR analyses showed that TaSC expression was induced by salt and ABA in wheat. Localization analysis showed that TaSC proteins were localized to the plasma membrane in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana. The overexpression of TaSC in Col-0 and atsc (SALK_072220) Arabidopsis strains resulted in increased salt tolerance of the transgenic plants. TaSC overexpression in Col-0 and atsc signiﬁcantly up-regulated the expression of AtFRY1, AtSAD1, and AtCDPK2. AtCDPK2 overexpression in atsc rescued the salt-sensitive phenotype of atsc. The TaSC gene may improve plant salt tolerance by acting via the CDPK pathway."

"24211069","abstracttext","This study assessed germination of wheat seeds under cold and biological stratification and determined the expression level of gibberellins (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) genes in coleorhiza. Both cold and biological stratification significantly (P<0.05) enhanced the rate and efficacy of germination. The spatial distance between the fungal endophyte and the seed can be a determining factor of biological stratification as seeds in direct contact with fungal endophyte showed the highest rate and efficacy of germination. Consistently high expression of GA3ox2 gene was found in wheat coleorhiza throughout the tested period of germination. The expression of ABA biosynthesis gene, TaNCED, was substantially higher in cold stratification seeds, reflecting the role of abscisic acid in stress-adaptation. Overall, this study provides molecular evidence of the importance of coleorhiza in germinating wheat seeds, in addition to reporting that the spatial distance between symbiotic partners may be a critical factor driving mycovitality."

In this study, a full-length open reading frame (ORF) of AGP-L gene (named as Agp2) in wheat and a series of Agp2 gene sequences in wheat relatives were isolated. The coding region of Agp2 contained 15 exons and 14 introns including a full-length ORF of 1566 nucleotides, and the deduced protein contained 522 amino acids (57.8 kDa). Generally, the phylogenetic tree of Agp2 indicated that sequences from A- and D-genome donor species were most similar to each other and sequences from B-genome donor species contained more variation. Starch accumulation and Agp2 expression in wheat grains reached their peak at 21 and 15 days post anthesis (DPA), respectively."

"27313595","abstracttext","Photoperiod response-related genes play a crucial role in duration of the plant growth. In this study, we focused on TaPRR73, a paralog of ""Green Revolution"" gene Ppd1 (TaPRR37). We found that overexpression of the truncated TaPRR73 form lacking part of the N-terminal PR domain in transgenic rice promoted heading under long day conditions. Association analysis in common wheat verified that TaPRR73 was an important agronomic photoperiod response gene that significantly affected heading date and plant height; expression analysis proved that specific alleles of TaPRR73-A1 had highly expressed levels in earlier heading lines; the distribution of haplotypes indicated that one of these alleles had been selected in breeding programs. Our results demonstrated that TaPRR73 contributed to regulation of heading date in wheat and could be useful in wheat breeding and in broadening adaptation of the crop to new regions."

The presence of transgene was also confirmed by PCR and Southern hybridization. Using this method, 3.07% transformation rate was observed. To identify transgenic lines carrying stably integrated CP4 - EPSPS gene, the transgenic populations were screened in T 3 generation using 1% glyphosate and lines with 100% survival were considered as homozygous. No significant morpho-physiological variations were observed within the transgenic lines as compared to non-transgenic plants. The present study resulted in herbicide-tolerant transgenic wheat and provides a valuable tool for development of wheat genetic transformation."

"30471731","abstracttext","In the present study on a wheat stay-green mutant, tasg1, we found that its delayed senescence at the late filling stage was related to the high cytokinin (CK) and N contents. RNA sequencing suggested that several genes may be responsible for the different senescence processes between wild-type (WT) and tasg1 plants. WT and tasg1 seedlings were treated with NH 4 NO 3 , lovastatin, and 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), and the results suggested that the feedback of CK with N content regulated the leaf senescence in the tasg1 plants. Furthermore, a knock-out of the candidate gene cisZOGT1 (catalytic O-glucosylation in cis-zeatin) in the wheat mutant pool 'Kronos' exhibited delayed senescence at the late grain filling stage. Overall, our results suggested the cisZOGT1 gene has an important role in regulating wheat leaf senescence by regulating CK and N metabolism. At the same time, CK and N metabolism involved in delayed flag leaf senescence of tasg1 may be by a feedback pattern."

"9406381","abstracttext","We report the cloning and characterization of a gene encoding a ferulic acid esterase, faeA, from Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus tubingensis. The A. niger and A. tubingensis genes have a high degree of sequence identity and contain one conserved intron. The gene product, FAEA, was overexpressed in wild-type A. tubingensis and a protease-deficient A. niger mutant. Overexpression of both genes in wild-type A. tubingensis and an A. niger protease-deficient mutant showed that the A. tubingensis gene product is more sensitive to degradation than the equivalent gene product from A. niger. FAEA from A. niger was identical to A. niger FAE-III (C. B. Faulds and G. Williamson, Microbiology 140:779-787, 1994), as assessed by molecular mass, pH and temperature optima, pI, N-terminal sequence, and activity on methyl ferulate. The faeA gene was induced by growth on wheat arabinoxylan and sugar beet pectin, and its gene product (FAEA) released ferulic acid from wheat arabinoxylan. The rate of release was enhanced by the presence of a xylanase. FAEA also hydrolyzed smaller amounts of ferulic acid from sugar beet pectin, but the rate was hardly affected by addition of an endo-pectin lyase."
"17364174","articletitle","Measuring global gene expression in polyploidy; a cautionary note from allohexaploid wheat."
"17364174","abstracttext","The number of global gene expression studies has increased significantly in recent years. It is assumed that the different techniques employed report similar levels of gene expression for each sequence type. While this may be true for many species, polyploids containing homoeologous and paralogous gene copies represent a unique situation. In this paper, we describe the comparison of the Affymetrix GeneChip Wheat Genome Array, an in-house custom-spotted complementary DNA array and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the study of gene expression in hexaploid wheat. Analysis of the data generated from each platform revealed little concordance and suggested that global comparisons are not possible. Potential causes of these inter-platform discrepancies were investigated and revealed to be due to the inability of the platforms to discriminate between different but related transcripts. Our results also showed that the traditionally used array validation technique, quantitative reverse transcription PCR, differs in its discriminatory ability, resulting in the poor confirmation rates seen in previous polyploid studies. These findings have implications for gene expression studies in polyploid organisms and highlight the need for homoeologous- and paralogous-specific arrays when investigating polyploid gene expression."

"18493079","abstracttext","Aluminum toxicity is a major problem in agriculture worldwide. Among the cultivated Triticeae, rye (Secale cereale L.) is one of the most Al tolerant and represents an important potential source of Al tolerance for improvement of wheat. The Alt4 Al-tolerance locus of rye contains a cluster of genes homologous to the single-copy Al-activated malate transporter (TaALMT1) Al-tolerance gene of wheat. Tolerant (M39A-1-6) and intolerant (M77A-1) rye haplotypes contain five and two genes, respectively, of which two (ScALMT1-M39.1 and ScALMT1-M39.2) and one (ScALMT1-M77.1) are highly expressed in the root tip, typically the main site of plant Al tolerance/susceptibility. All three transcripts are upregulated by exposure to Al. High-resolution genetic mapping identified two resistant lines resulting from recombination within the gene cluster. These recombinants exclude all genes flanking the gene cluster as candidates for controlling Alt4 tolerance, including a homolog of the barley HvMATE Al-tolerance gene. In the recombinants, one hybrid gene containing a chimeric open reading frame and the ScALMT1-M39.1 gene each appeared to be sufficient to provide full tolerance. mRNA splice variation was observed for two of the rye ALMT1 genes and in one case, was correlated with a approximately 400-bp insertion in an intron."

"16399012","abstracttext","Cold acclimation, an adaptive process for developing freezing tolerance in over-wintering plants, is associated with increased expression levels of a series of cold-responsive (Cor)/late embryogenesis abundant (Lea) genes. To investigate the function of Wcor15, a member of the wheat Cor/Lea gene family, for improvement of freezing tolerance, two types of transgenic tobacco lines expressing Wcor15-containing chimeric genes were produced and characterized. Immunoblot and gene expression analyses of a transgenic tobacco line expressing the Wcor15-GFP fusion gene under control of the CaMV35S promoter showed transport and abundant accumulation of the WCOR15 protein in the stromal compartment of the chloroplasts. The 5' upstream region of Wcor15 induced expression of the GFP reporter gene under low-temperature conditions in the transgenic tobacco. Both transgenic lines expressing the Wcor15-GFP fusion gene showed a similar and significantly improved level of freezing tolerance compared with the wild-type tobacco plants. Our results demonstrate that the induced expression of the wheat Wcor15 gene positively contributes to the development of freezing tolerance in the heterologous tobacco plants."

"19767902","abstracttext","An in-depth analysis was carried out with expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for genes in and near the HMW-GS loci. Considerations for using ESTs are discussed, including the occurrence of chimeric and aberrant HMW-GS ESTs. Complete gene sequences demonstrated the feasibility of constructing accurate full-length coding regions from EST assemblies and found, or supported, errors in several previously reported HMW-GS gene sequences. New complete HMW-GS gene sequences are reported for the cultivars Chinese Spring and Glenlea. The Ay subunit gene, which is considered null in cultivated wheats, was shown to transcribe in at least two germplasms. Analyses support the conclusion that of the five known genes within this genomic region, the two HMW-GS genes and the globulin gene are highly expressed. The other two genes, encoding a receptor kinase and a protein kinase, have one and no identifiable wheat EST, respectively, although ESTs are found for the orthologous genes in barley. The ESTs of all five genes within the HMW-GS region are either definitely associated with the endosperm or possibly originate from imbibed seed, suggesting the four distinct gene classes in this region are part of a seed or endosperm chromatin domain. EST resources were also used to determine relative abundance of ESTs for all classes of wheat prolamines and indicated differential levels of expression both among germplasms and among the three genomes of hexaploid wheats."

Studies were conducted on cultivated emmer-derived wheat line K2 to identify genes involved in powdery mildew resistance at the seedling and adult plant growth stages using a BC(1) doubled haploid population derived from a cross between K2 and susceptible cultivar Audace. A single gene was located distal to microsatellite marker Xgwm294 on the long arm of chromosome 2A. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis indicated that the gene was also effective at the adult plant stage, explaining up to 79.0 % of the variation in the progeny. Comparison of genetic maps indicated that the resistance gene in K2 was different from Pm4, the only other formally named resistance gene located on chromosome 2AL, and PmHNK54, a gene derived from Chinese germplasm.

"30182235","abstracttext","Biotrophic fungi (Puccinia spp.) cause devastating diseases of wheat and other cereal species globally. The function of large repertories of genes from Puccinia spp. still needs to be discovered to understand the infection process of these obligate parasites, eventually to protect plants from rust diseases. Functional analysis of targeted genes is challenging due to the inherent difficulties with culturing the fungus and transforming the host. RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved gene regulation process in eukaryotes and known to be a powerful genetic tool in plant biotechnology. More recently, host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) has been developed to assess pathogen gene function in plants. HIGS is an RNAi-based process where double stranded RNA (dsRNA) homologous to a pathogen gene can be expressed in a plant to induce targeted silencing of the pathogen gene. Here we described a detailed HIGS protocol for functional analysis of rust genes from Puccinia species in cereals. As an example we describe an experiment silencing the tryptophan 2-monooxygenase gene (Pgt-IaaM) from Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) that is involved in virulence to wheat."

"1936962","abstracttext","Bread wheat is an allohexaploid consisting of three genetically related (homoeologous) genomes. The homoeologous chromosomes are capable of pairing but strict homologous pairing is observed at metaphase 1. The diploid-like pairing is regulated predominantly by Ph1, a gene mapped on long arm of chromosome 5B. We report direct evidence that a mutant of the gene (ph1b) arose from a submicroscopic deletion. A probe (XksuS1-5) detects the same missing fragment in two independent mutants ph1b and ph1c and a higher intensity fragment in a duplication of the Ph1 gene. It is likely that XksuS1-5 lies adjacent to Ph1 on the same chromosome fragment that is deleted in ph1b and ph1c. XksuS1-5 can be used to tag Ph1 gene to facilitate incorporation of genetic material from homoeologous genomes of the Triticeae. It may also be a useful marker in cloning Ph1 gene by chromosome walking."

A strong sequence homology of this tRNA(Cys)(GCA) gene with its chloroplast counterpart in wheat suggests that it may be part of a chloroplast DNA insertion into the mitochondrial genome. This gene has been found to be transcribed in the mitochondrion. Two tRNA genes are located on the 5.7 kb BamHI fragment, separated from each other by 250 bp. One is a mitochondrial tRNA(Ser)(GCU) gene. The other, a non-transcribed tRNA(Phe)-like gene, is interrupted by a 49 base-pair inserted DNA sequence in the variable loop and has a Leu (UAA) anticodon."

"8589938","abstracttext","We isolated a cDNA for a gene that encodes the 23 kDa protein of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II in rice. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA is highly similar (71-60% homology) to those of the analogous genes from wheat, tomato, pea, spinach, tobacco and mustard. The expression of the gene that corresponds to the 23 kDa protein was inducible in green organs of mature and immature leaves, stems and young panicles but not inducible in roots. The high level of the transcripts was detected in both mature leaves and young panicles. The expression of the gene was low in etiolated seedlings, while the transcript of the gene was strongly induced by light, and the level of the expression increased during light irradiation. These observations suggest that the expression of the gene encoding the 23 kDa protein is organ-specific and light-inducible."

"8375657","abstracttext","The diploid-like chromosome pairing in polyploid wheat is controlled by the Ph1 (pairing homoeologous) gene that is located on chromosome arm 5BL. By using a combination of cytogenetic and molecular techniques, we report the physical location of the Ph1 gene to a submicroscopic chromosome region (Ph1 gene region) that is flanked by the breakpoints of two deletions (5BL-1 and ph1c) and is marked by a DNA probe (XksuS1). The Ph1 gene region is present distal to the breakpoint of deletion 5BL-1 but proximal to the C-band 5BL2.1. Two other DNA probes (Xpsr128 and Xksu75) flank the region-Xpsr128 being proximal and Xksu75 being distal. The estimated size of the region is less than 3 Mb. The chromosome region around the Ph1 gene is high in recombination as the genetic distance of the region between 5BL-1 breakpoint and C-band 5BL2.1 (not resolved by the microscope) is at least 9.3 cM."
"8842149","articletitle","The rapeseed mitochondrial gene encoding a homologue of the bacterial protein Ccl1 is divided into two independently transcribed reading frames."
"8842149","abstracttext","In the rapeseed mitochondrial genome we identified sequences that have a high similarity to those of a bacterial gene involved in the biogenesis of cytochromes c designated ccl1. The structure of this gene is quite unusual. In rapeseed mitochondria, the ccl1-homologous (orf577) sequence is divided into two parts, which are at least 45 kb apart. These two parts are transcribed separately and their transcripts are edited similarly to the homologous transcripts of wheat and Oenothera. However it was impossible to identify a mature transcript covering the whole coding region, a result that excludes a trans-splicing event. No other copy of this gene was found in either the nuclear genome or the mitochondrial genome. The protein product of orf577 is present in rapeseed mitochondria. These results raise the possibility that this divided gene might be functional and active in rapeseed mitochondria through a novel mechanism of gene expression."

"11410655","abstracttext","Mitochondrial gene expression was studied using an electrotransformation protocol to introduce foreign DNA into purified wheat mitochondria. Optimal conditions for DNA uptake and transient gene expression were determined. We show here that a DNA plasmid containing either a cognate or a non-cognate gene under the control of a plant mitochondrial promoter is incorporated into the organelle and faithfully recognized by the transcription machinery. Transcripts generated by a plasmid bearing the intron-containing cox II gene were correctly spliced. Moreover, the transcripts were edited at the expected target C residues. The expression and maturation process of the transgene is dependent on the integrity of functional elements such as the promotor or the presence of structural domains necessary for splicing. The mitochondrial transformation described in this report is an important tool to study the multiple steps involved in plant mitochondrial gene expression at conditions closer to those found in vivo."

"12450128","abstracttext","We isolated a beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase encoding gene and its cDNA from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, and designated it nagA. The nagA gene contained no intron and encoded a polypeptide of 603 amino acids with a putative 19-amino acid signal sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence was very similar to the sequence of Candida albicans Hex1 and Trichoderma harzianum Nag1. Yeast cells containing the nagA cDNA under the control of the GAL1 promoter expressed beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity. The chromosomal nagA gene of A. nidulans was disrupted by replacement with the argB marker gene. The disruptant strains expressed low levels of beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity and showed poor growth on a medium containing chitobiose as a carbon source. Aspergillus oryzae strain carrying the nagA gene under the control of the improved glaA promoter produced large amounts of beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase in a wheat bran solid culture."

"16593757","abstracttext","The bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene was expressed in protoplasts of three important graminaceous plant species after introduction of the gene by electroporation. Gene transfer occurred when high-voltage electric pulses were applied either directly or indirectly (without anode contact) to a solution containing plasmid DNA and protoplasts of rice, wheat, or sorghum. The indirect method was more rapid, resulted in higher protoplast viability, and was less subject to contamination than the direct-contact method. Gene expression of approximately equal magnitude resulted when the CAT gene was fused to either the 35S promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus or the copia long terminal repeat promoter of Drosophila. Together with recent advances in regeneration of callus and whole plants from protoplasts, this system makes it possible to study inheritance and expression of genes introduced into graminaceous monocotyledonous plants."

"20224818","abstracttext","The expression of genes involved in starch synthesis in wheat was analyzed together with the accumulation profiles of soluble sugars, starch, protein, and starch granule distribution in developing caryopses obtained from the same biological materials used for profiling of gene expression using DNA microarrays. Multiple expression patterns were detected for the different starch biosynthetic gene isoforms, suggesting their relative importance through caryopsis development. Members of the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, starch synthase, starch branching enzyme, and sucrose synthase gene families showed different expression profiles; expression of some members of these gene families coincided with a period of high accumulation of starch while others did not. A biphasic pattern was observed in the rates of starch and protein accumulation which paralleled changes in global gene expression. Metabolic and regulatory genes that show a pattern of expression similar to starch accumulation and granule size distribution were identified, suggesting their coinvolvement in these biological processes."

A modified wheat histone H4 protein, H4TL (H4-TAT-LHRH), as a protein-based gene delivery vector that was able to form stable complexes with plasmid DNA and increase gene delivery efficiency has been described previously. In this study, H4TL has been used to deliver apoptin gene into a human ovarian carcinoma cell line HO8910. After transfection, increased expression of apoptin at both mRNA and protein levels was detected in HO8910 cells, accompanied by reduced rate of growth of HO8910 cells in vitro and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in these cells. These data demonstrate that H4TL-mediated transfer of apoptin initiates mitochondrial death pathway in ovarian cancer cells and suggest a novel therapeutic strategy for cancer."

This is especially useful for genes with repetitive sequences in their gene bodies in gene families. We illustrate the use of PacBio to sequence and assemble hundreds of transcripts of gluten gene families from different cultivars of wheat using sequence from a single SMRT cell. To this end, we barcoded amplicons from different cultivars, then pooled these into one library for sequencing. Sequencing reads were later separated by the barcodes and further sorted into different gene groups by blast. The reads from each gene are then assembled by SeqmanNGen software. Given the length of 1 kb for each sequence derived from an initial molecule, the phase of the polymorphisms is not lost and can be used to infer also haplotype differences between different cultivars."

"17106734","abstracttext","Low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) play an important role in bread and noodle processing quality by influencing the viscoelasticity and extensibility of dough. The objectives of this study were to characterize Glu-D3 subunit coding genes and to develop molecular markers for identifying Glu-D3 gene haplotypes. Gene specific primer sets were designed to amplify eight wheat cultivars containing Glu-D3a, b, c, d and e alleles, defined traditionally by protein electrophoretic mobility. Three novel Glu-D3 DNA sequences, designated as GluD3-4, GluD3-5 and GluD3-6, were amplified from the eight wheat cultivars. GluD3-4 showed three allelic variants or haplotypes at the DNA level in the eight cultivars, which were designated as GluD3-41, GluD3-42 and GluD3-43. Compared with GluD3-42, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was detected for GluD3-43 in the coding region, resulting in a pseudo-gene with a nonsense mutation at the 119th position of deduced peptide, and a 3-bp insertion was found in the coding region of GluD3-41, leading to a glutamine insertion at the 249th position of its deduced protein. The coding regions for GluD3-5 and GluD3-6 showed no allelic variation in the eight cultivars tested, indicating that they were relatively conservative in common wheat. Based on the 12 allelic variants of three Glu-D3 genes identified in this study and three detected previously, seven STS markers were established to amplify the corresponding gene sequences in wheat cultivars containing five Glu-D3 alleles (a, b, c, d and e). The seven primer sets M2F12/M2R12, M2F2/M2R2, M2F3/M2R3, M3F1/M3R1, M3F2/M3R2, M4F1/M4R1 and M4F3/M4R3 were specific to the allelic variants GluD3-21/22, GluD3-22, GluD3-23, GluD3-31, GluD3-32, GluD3-41 and GluD3-43, respectively, which were validated by amplifying 20 Chinese wheat cultivars containing alleles a, b, c and f based on protein electrophoretic mobility. These markers will be useful to identify the Glu-D3 gene haplotypes in wheat breeding programs."
"18030664","articletitle","Enhancing lignan biosynthesis by over-expressing pinoresinol lariciresinol reductase in transgenic wheat."
"18030664","abstracttext","Lignans are phenylpropane dimers that are biosynthesized via the phenylpropanoid pathway, in which pinoresinol lariciresinol reductase (PLR) catalyzes the last steps of lignan production. Our previous studies demonstrated that the contents of lignans in various wheat cultivars were significantly associated with anti-tumor activities in APC(Min) mice. To enhance lignan biosynthesis, this study was conducted to transform wheat cultivars ('Bobwhite', 'Madison', and 'Fielder', respectively) with the Forsythia intermedia PLR gene under the regulatory control of maize ubiquitin promoter. Of 24 putative transgenic wheat lines, we successfully obtained 3 transformants with the inserted ubiquitin-PLR gene as screened by PCR. Southern blot analysis further demonstrated that different copies of the PLR gene up to 5 were carried out in their genomes. Furthermore, a real-time PCR indicated approximately 17% increase of PLR gene expression over the control in 2 of the 3 positive transformants at T(0) generation. The levels of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, a prominent lignan in wheat as determined by HPLC-MS, were found to be 2.2-times higher in one of the three positive transgenic sub-lines at T(2 )than that in the wild-type (117.9 +/- 4.5 vs. 52.9 +/- 19.8 mug/g, p <0.005). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that elevated lignan levels in a transgenic wheat line has been successfully achieved through genetic engineering of over-expressed PLR gene. Although future studies are needed for a stably expression and more efficient transformants, the new wheat line with significantly higher SDG contents obtained from this study may have potential application in providing additive health benefits for cancer prevention."

"20470444","abstracttext_background","In the last hundred years, the development of improved wheat cultivars has led to the replacement of landraces and traditional varieties by modern cultivars. This has resulted in a decline in the genetic diversity of agriculturally used wheat. However, the diversity lost in the elite material is somewhat preserved in crop gene banks. Therefore, the gene bank accessions provide the basis for genetic improvement of crops for specific traits and and represent rich sources of novel allelic variation."
"20470444","abstracttext_results","We have undertaken large scale molecular allele mining to isolate new alleles of the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm3 from wheat gene bank accessions. The search for new Pm3 alleles was carried out on a geographically diverse set of 733 wheat accessions originating from 20 countries. Pm3 specific molecular tools as well as classical pathogenicity tests were used to characterize the accessions. Two new functional Pm3 alleles were identified out of the eight newly cloned Pm3 sequences. These new resistance alleles were isolated from accessions from China and Nepal. Thus, the repertoire of functional Pm3 alleles now includes 17 genes, making it one of the largest allelic series of plant resistance genes. The combined information on resistant and susceptible Pm3 sequences will allow to study molecular function and specificity of functional Pm3 alleles."

"21830110","abstracttext","Low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GSs) are encoded by a multi-gene family and are essential for determining the quality of wheat flour products, such as bread and noodles. However, the exact role or contribution of individual LMW-GS genes to wheat quality remains unclear. This is, at least in part, due to the difficulty in characterizing complete sequences of all LMW-GS gene family members in bread wheat. To identify full-length LMW-GS genes, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method was established, consisting of newly designed conserved primers and the previously developed LMW-GS gene molecular marker system. Using the PCR-based method, 17 LMW-GS genes were identified and characterized in Xiaoyan 54, of which 12 contained full-length sequences. Sequence alignments showed that 13 LMW-GS genes were identical to those found in Xiaoyan 54 using the genomic DNA library screening, and the other four full-length LMW-GS genes were first isolated from Xiaoyan 54. In Chinese Spring, 16 unique LMW-GS genes were isolated, and 13 of them contained full-length coding sequences. Additionally, 16 and 17 LMW-GS genes in Dongnong 101 and Lvhan 328 (chosen from the micro-core collections of Chinese germplasm), respectively, were also identified. Sequence alignments revealed that at least 15 LMW-GS genes were common in the four wheat varieties, and allelic variants of each gene shared high sequence identities (>95%) but exhibited length polymorphism in repetitive regions. This study provides a PCR-based method for efficiently identifying LMW-GS genes in bread wheat, which will improve the characterization of complex members of the LMW-GS gene family and facilitate the understanding of their contributions to wheat quality."

"22672222","abstracttext_background","Carotenoids are isoprenoid pigments, essential for photosynthesis and photoprotection in plants. The enzyme phytoene synthase (PSY) plays an essential role in mediating condensation of two geranylgeranyl diphosphate molecules, the first committed step in carotenogenesis. PSY are nuclear enzymes encoded by a small gene family consisting of three paralogous genes (PSY1-3) that have been widely characterized in rice, maize and sorghum."
"22672222","abstracttext_results","In wheat, for which yellow pigment content is extremely important for flour colour, only PSY1 has been extensively studied because of its association with QTLs reported for yellow pigment whereas PSY2 has been partially characterized. Here, we report the isolation of bread wheat PSY3 genes from a Renan BAC library using Brachypodium as a model genome for the Triticeae to develop Conserved Orthologous Set markers prior to gene cloning and sequencing. Wheat PSY3 homoeologous genes were sequenced and annotated, unravelling their novel structure associated with intron-loss events and consequent exonic fusions. A wheat PSY3 promoter region was also investigated for the presence of cis-acting elements involved in the response to abscisic acid (ABA), since carotenoids also play an important role as precursors of signalling molecules devoted to plant development and biotic/abiotic stress responses. Expression of wheat PSYs in leaves and roots was investigated during ABA treatment to confirm the up-regulation of PSY3 during abiotic stress."
"22672222","abstracttext_conclusions","We investigated the structural and functional determinisms of PSY genes in wheat. More generally, among eudicots and monocots, the PSY gene family was found to be associated with differences in gene copy numbers, allowing us to propose an evolutionary model for the entire PSY gene family in Grasses."

"22935214","abstracttext_background","Polyploidization is considered one of the main mechanisms of plant genome evolution. The presence of multiple copies of the same gene reduces selection pressure and permits sub-functionalization and neo-functionalization leading to plant diversification, adaptation and speciation. In bread wheat, polyploidization and the prevalence of transposable elements resulted in massive gene duplication and movement. As a result, the number of genes which are non-collinear to genomes of related species seems markedly increased in wheat."
"22935214","abstracttext_results","We used new-generation sequencing (NGS) to generate sequence of a Mb-sized region from wheat chromosome arm 3DS. Sequence assembly of 24 BAC clones resulted in two scaffolds of 1,264,820 and 333,768 bases. The sequence was annotated and compared to the homoeologous region on wheat chromosome 3B and orthologous loci of Brachypodium distachyon and rice. Among 39 coding sequences in the 3DS scaffolds, 32 have a homoeolog on chromosome 3B. In contrast, only fifteen and fourteen orthologs were identified in the corresponding regions in rice and Brachypodium, respectively. Interestingly, five pseudogenes were identified among the non-collinear coding sequences at the 3B locus, while none was found at the 3DS locus."
"22935214","abstracttext_conclusion","Direct comparison of two Mb-sized regions of the B and D genomes of bread wheat revealed similar rates of non-collinear gene insertion in both genomes with a majority of gene duplications occurring before their divergence. Relatively low proportion of pseudogenes was identified among non-collinear coding sequences. Our data suggest that the pseudogenes did not originate from insertion of non-functional copies, but were formed later during the evolution of hexaploid wheat. Some evidence was found for gene erosion along the B genome locus."
"24078011","articletitle","Copy number variation of chromosome 5A and its association with Q gene expression, morphological aberrations, and agronomic performance of winter wheat cultivars."
"24078011","abstracttext_key message","Our investigations combine chromosome 5A copy number variation associated with relative 5A Q gene expression and morphological and agronomic data to characterize the occurrence of speltoid plants in winter wheat cultivars. The occurrence of speltoid aberrants in wheat breeding is a serious problem that may result in rejection of a candidate cultivar during licensing. The spear-shaped, hard threshing spike is caused by copy number reduction of the domestication gene Q, located on the long arm of wheat chromosome 5A. As a member of the APETALA2-like transcription factor family, the 5AQ gene is involved in flower development and pleiotropically controls other agronomic traits. In this report, a characterization of instability of chromosome 5A is given and effects due to the loss of the Q gene and other genes are discussed. Based on pyrosequencing, we correctly predicted the 5AQ copy number for 392 of 402 tested offspring plants (97.5 %) originating from single speltoid plants of eleven wheat cultivars. The findings indicate that the resulting speltoid plants were either reduced in chromosome 5A copy number or possessed a partial deletion of the distal end of chromosome arm 5AL. 5AQ specific real-time PCR analysis revealed varying transcription levels among cultivars. During early spike development, the relative transcription of the 5AQ gene was always lower in speltoids than in normal square headed wheat plants, most likely leading to the occurrence of the characteristic speltoid spike phenotype. The parallel analysis of 18 agronomic traits revealed pleiotropic effects governed by genes located on 5A. Our results demonstrate that through pyrosequencing one can identify aneuploidy or deletions within chromosome 5A to select against the occurrence of speltoid plants in wheat seedlings."

"24330651","abstracttext_background","Certain temperate species require prolonged exposure to low temperature to initiate transition from vegetative growth to flowering, a process known as vernalization. In wheat, winter cultivars require vernalization to initiate flowering, making vernalization requirement a trait of key importance in wheat agronomy. The genetic bases of vernalization response have been largely studied in wheat, leading to the characterization of a regulation pathway that involves the key gene VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1). While previous studies in wheat and barley have revealed the functional role of histone modification in setting VRN1 expression, other mechanisms might also be involved. Here, we were interested in determining whether the cold-induced expression of the wheat VRN-A1 gene is associated with a change in DNA methylation."
"24330651","abstracttext_results","We provide the first DNA methylation analysis of the VRN-A1 gene, and describe the existence of methylation at CG but also at non CG sites. While CG sites show a bell-shape profile typical of gene-body methylation, non CG methylation is restricted to the large (8.5 kb) intron 1, in a region harboring fragments of transposable elements (TEs). Interestingly, cold induces a site-specific hypermethylation at these non CG sites. This increase in DNA methylation is transmitted through mitosis, and is reset to its original level after sexual reproduction."
"24330651","abstracttext_conclusions","These results demonstrate that VRN-A1 has a particular DNA methylation pattern, exhibiting rapid shift within the life cycle of a winter wheat plant following exposure to particular environmental conditions. The finding that this shift occurs at non CG sites in a TE-rich region opens interesting questions onto the possible consequences of this type of methylation in gene expression."
"24942074","articletitle","The powdery mildew resistance gene Pm8 derived from rye is suppressed by its wheat ortholog Pm3."
"24942074","abstracttext","The powdery mildew resistance gene Pm8 derived from rye is located on a 1BL.1RS chromosome translocation in wheat. However, some wheat lines with this translocation do not show resistance to isolates of the wheat powdery mildew pathogen avirulent to Pm8 due to an unknown genetically dominant suppression mechanism. Here we show that lines with suppressed Pm8 activity contain an intact and expressed Pm8 gene. Therefore, the absence of Pm8 function in certain 1BL.1RS-containing wheat lines is not the result of gene loss or mutation but is based on suppression. The wheat gene Pm3, an ortholog of rye Pm8, suppressed Pm8-mediated powdery mildew resistance in lines containing Pm8 in a transient single-cell expression assay. This result was further confirmed in transgenic lines with combined Pm8 and Pm3 transgenes. Expression analysis revealed that suppression is not the result of gene silencing, either in wheat 1BL.1RS translocation lines carrying Pm8 or in transgenic genotypes with both Pm8 and Pm3 alleles. In addition, a similar abundance of the PM8 and PM3 proteins in single or double homozygous transgenic lines suggested that a post-translational mechanism is involved in suppression of Pm8. Co-expression of Pm8 and Pm3 genes in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves followed by co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the two proteins interact. Therefore, the formation of a heteromeric protein complex might result in inefficient or absent signal transmission for the defense reaction. These data provide a molecular explanation for the suppression of resistance genes in certain genetic backgrounds and suggest ways to circumvent it in future plant breeding."
"28702045","articletitle","Functional Characterization of TaFUSCA3, a B3-Superfamily Transcription Factor Gene in the Wheat."
"28702045","abstracttext","The end-use quality of wheat, including its unique rheology and viscoelastic properties, is predominantly determined by the composition and concentration of gluten proteins. While, the mechanism regulating expression of the seed storage protein (SSP) genes and other related genes in wheat remains unclear. In this study, we report on the cloning and functional identification of TaFUSCA3 , a B3-superfamily transcription factor (TF) gene in wheat. Sequence alignment indicated that wheat and barley FUSCA3 genes are highly conserved. Quantitative reverse-transcription (qRT)-PCR analysis showed that the transcript of TaFUSCA3 was accumulated mostly in the stamens and the endosperms of immature wheat seeds. Yeast-one-hybrid results proved that the full-length TaFUSCA3 and its C-terminal region had transcriptional activities. Yeast-two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays indicated that TaFUSCA3 could activate the expression of the high molecular weight glutenin subunit gene Glu-1Bx7 and interact with the seed-specific bZIP protein TaSPA. DNA-protein-interaction enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated that TaFUSCA3 specifically recognizes the RY-box of the Glu-1Bx7 promoter region. Transient expression results showed that TaFUSCA3 could trans -activate the Glu-1Bx7 promoter, which contains eight RY-box sequences. TaFUSCA3 was unable to activate the downstream transcription when the RY-box was fully mutated. TaFUSCA3 could activate the transcription of the At2S3 gene promoter in a complementation of loss-of-function experiment using the Arabidopsis thaliana line fus3-3 , which is a FUSCA3 mutant, demonstrating the evolutionary conservation of the TaFUSCA3 gene. In conclusion, the wheat B3-type TF, TaFUSCA3, is functional conserved between monocot and dicot, and could regulate SSP gene expression by interacting specifically with TaSPA."
"29997638","articletitle","A Pathogen-Responsive Leucine Rich Receptor Like Kinase Contributes to Fusarium Resistance in Cereals."
"29997638","abstracttext","Receptor-like kinases form the largest family of receptors in plants and play an important role in recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns and modulating the plant immune responses to invasive fungi, including cereal defenses against fungal diseases. But hitherto, none have been shown to modulate the wheat response to the economically important Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease of small-grain cereals. Homologous genes were identified on barley chromosome 6H ( HvLRRK-6H ) and wheat chromosome 6DL ( TaLRRK-6D ), which encode the characteristic domains of surface-localized receptor like kinases. Gene expression studies validated that the wheat TaLRRK-6D is highly induced in heads as an early response to both the causal pathogen of FHB disease, Fusarium graminearum , and its' mycotoxic virulence factor deoxynivalenol. The transcription of other wheat homeologs of this gene, located on chromosomes 6A and 6B, was also up-regulated in response to F. graminearum . Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of the barley HvLRRK-6H compromised leaf defense against F. graminearum . VIGS of TaLRRK-6D in two wheat cultivars, CM82036 (resistant to FHB disease) and cv. Remus (susceptible to FHB), confirmed that TaLRRK-6D contributes to basal resistance to FHB disease in both genotypes. Although the effect of VIGS did not generally reduce grain losses due to FHB, this experiment did reveal that TaLRRK-6D positively contributes to grain development. Further gene expression studies in wheat cv. Remus indicated that VIGS of TaLRRK-6D suppressed the expression of genes involved in salicylic acid signaling, which is a key hormonal pathway involved in defense. Thus, this study provides the first evidence of receptor like kinases as an important component of cereal defense against Fusarium and highlights this gene as a target for enhancing cereal resistance to FHB disease."
"30405661","articletitle","Development of Wheat With Hypoimmunogenic Gluten Obstructed by the Gene Editing Policy in Europe."
"30405661","abstracttext","Coeliac Disease (CD) is an auto-immune reaction to gluten in 1-2% of the human population. A gluten-free (GF) diet, excluding wheat, barley, and rye, is the only remedy. This diet is difficult to adhere to, partly because wheat gluten is added to many processed products for their viscoelastic properties. In addition, GF products are less healthy and expensive. Wheat products containing only hypoimmunogenic gluten proteins would be a desirable option. Various gluten peptides that trigger CD have been characterized. A single wheat variety contains around hundred gluten genes, producing proteins with varying numbers of epitopes. Gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9 can precisely remove or modify the DNA sequences coding for immunogenic peptides. Wheat with hypoimmunogenic gluten thus exemplifies the potential of gene editing for improving crops for human consumption where conventional breeding cannot succeed. We describe here, in relation to breeding hypoimmunogenic wheat varieties, the inconsistencies of applying GM regulation in Europe for gene-edited plants while mutation breeding-derived plants are exempted. We explain that healthy products derived from this new technology may become available in the United States, Canada, Argentina and other countries but not in Europe, because of strict regulation of unintended GM risk at the expense of reduction the existing immunogenicity risks of patients. We argue that regulation of gene-edited plants should be based on scientific evidence. Therefore, we strongly recommend implementing the innovation principle.

"30252627","abstracttext","ToxA, a necrotrophic effector originally identified from the tan spot fungus Pyrenophora tritici-repentis in 1987, was subsequently identified from Parastagonospora nodorum in 2006. More recently, the ToxA gene was identified in the spot blotch fungus Bipolaris sorokiniana in Australia. Here we show that the ToxA gene is also present in the B. sorokiniana population in the winter wheat region of southcentral Texas. Leaves from 'Duster' wheat showing strong necrotic lesions were collected in Castroville, TX. Fifteen single-spore isolates were collected from separate lesions, and 13 of them harbored the BsToxA gene and secreted ToxA in culture based on sensitivity of BG261, the differential line containing the dominant ToxA sensitivity gene, Tsn1. Four isolates harboring BsToxA and one deficient in BsToxA were used to infiltrate two wheat lines harboring Tsn1 as well as their corresponding tsn1 mutant lines. Culture filtrates of the isolate lacking BsToxA did not induce necrosis on any of the lines. Culture filtrates of the four BsToxA-containing isolates induced necrosis on the wild type (Tsn1) lines but not on the corresponding tsn1 mutant lines. Sensitivity to these culture filtrates also mapped to the previously identified location for Tsn1 in the winter wheat mapping population Arina × Forno. Inoculation of one of these ToxA-producing isolates on the same population showed that the Tsn1 locus accounted for 24.4% of the disease variation. All 13 isolates harbored the same BsToxA nucleotide sequence, which was identical to one of the two haplotypes previously identified in Australia. Sensitivity to ToxA is prevalent in popular hard winter wheat cultivars in the central and southcentral winter wheat regions of the United States, showing the potential of a selective advantage for B. sorokiniana isolates that harbor the ToxA gene."

"32415192","abstracttext","Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV) causes a serious viral disease that can significantly reduce grain yield in winter wheat worldwide. Using resistant cultivars is the only feasible strategy to reduce the losses caused by SBWMV. To fine map the resistance gene Sbwm1, 205 wheat accessions was genotyped using wheat Infinium iSelect Beadchips with 90 K SNPs. Association analysis identified 35 SNPs in 12 wheat genes and one intergenic SNP in the Sbwm1 region that showed a significant association with SBWMV resistance. Those SNPs were converted into Kompetitive Allele-Specific Polymerase assays (KASP) and analyzed in two F 6 -derived recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations derived from the crosses between two resistant cultivars 'Wesley' and 'Deliver' and a susceptible line 'OK03825-5403-6'. Linkage analysis mapped this gene on chromosome 5D at intervals of 5.1 cM and 3.4 cM in the two populations, respectively. The two flanking markers in both populations delimited the gene to a 620 kb region where 19 genes were annotated. Comparative analysis identified a syntenic region of 660 kb in Ae. tauschii with 18 annotated genes and a syntenic region in chromosome 1 of B. distachyon. The candidate region includes several disease resistance related genes and we identified a PTI1-like tyrosine-protein kinase 1 gene as a putative candidate gene for Sbwm1. The two flanking SNPs for Sbwm1 can effectively separate the resistant and susceptible lines in a new diversity panel of 159 wheat germplasm. The results from this study lay a solid foundation for the cloning, functional characterization and marker-assisted selection of Sbwm1."

"31501915","abstracttext_key message","Five putative candidate genes for OWBM resistance in Chinese winter wheat 'Jimai 24' were identified via BSR-seq and differential expression analyses. Orange wheat blossom midge (OWBM), Sitodiplosis mosellana, is one of the most serious threats to wheat production worldwide. Conventional gene mapping methods to identify genes require significant amounts of financial support and time. Here, bulked segregant RNA-seq (BSR-seq) was applied to profile candidate genes and develop associated markers for OWBM resistance. Previously, we identified a major QTL (QSm.hebau-4A) for OWBM resistance on the long arm of chromosome 4A. In this study, we aimed at screening differentially expressed resistance genes associated with this QTL. Twelve differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained based on BSR-seq and differential expression analyses. Among them, four were confirmed to be associated with OWBM resistance via quantitative reverse transcription PCR, using an additional set of wheat samples subjected to OWBM invasion. One SPI-like gene and one Malectin-like gene were revealed by gene annotation, respectively. Sequencing results confirmed that the four DEGs and the SPI gene had SNP polymorphisms between wheat parents. All these five resistance-related genes for OWBM were located in the same genomic region with QSm.hebau-4A. Furthermore, six new markers developed based on sequences of the five genes were also mapped in the same genomic region using genetic population. These five genes may be the candidate genes for OWBM resistance in Chinese wheat 'Jimai 24' and should be the targets for further positional isolation."

"16666422","abstracttext","Promoter strengths of two maize alcohol dehydrogenase genes, Adh1 and Adh2, and the maize shrunken-1 gene, Sh1, were evaluated by transient expression in cultured protoplasts of Panicum maximum, Triticum monococcum, and Daucus carota. Promoter elements were ligated in correct and opposite orientations as transcriptional gene fusions to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene containing the nopaline synthase 3' polyadenylation signal. The relative levels of gene expression were compared to the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. The full length Adh1 promoter (-1100 to +15) functioned in all species, but at a reduced level in D. carota. An Adh1 promoter deletion from -304 to -1100 did not express at detectable levels in any species nor did the Sh1 promoter construction. The Adh2 promoter (-860 to +90) only expressed in D. carota. The full length Adh1 promoter gave the highest level of CAT expression in the monocot cells but at levels which were approximately 30% compared to the CaMV 35S promoter. This was reduced further in D. carota to approximately 4%. These data suggest that at least some of the regulatory factors responsible for promoter function are somewhat species specific and that these differences should be considered in gene expression studies."

"22081040","abstracttext","Vernalization, a period of low temperature to induce transition from vegetative to reproductive state, is an important environmental stimulus for many cool season grasses. A key gene in the vernalization pathway in grasses is the VRN1 gene. The objective of this study was to identify causative polymorphism(s) at the VRN1 locus in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) for variation in vernalization requirement. Two allelic Bacterial Artificial Chromosome clones of the VRN1 locus from the two genotypes Veyo and Falster with contrasting vernalization requirements were identified, sequenced, and characterized. Analysis of the allelic sequences identified an 8.6-kb deletion in the first intron of the VRN1 gene in the Veyo genotype which has low vernalization requirement. This deletion was in a divergent recurrent selection experiment confirmed to be associated with genotypes with low vernalization requirement. The region surrounding the VRN1 locus in perennial ryegrass showed microcolinearity to the corresponding region on chromosome 3 in Oryza sativa with conserved gene order and orientation, while the micro-colinearity to the corresponding region in Triticum monococcum was less conserved. Our study indicates that the first intron of the VRN1 gene, and in particular the identified 8.6 kb region, is an important regulatory region for vernalization response in perennial ryegrass."

It is, however, assumed that the diaminopimelic acid pathway exists in the plant kingdom, as commonly described forEscherichia coli.Modification and refinement of lytic complementation, a technique previously utilized in bacterial systems, facilitated the isolation of a functional Diaminopimelate Dehydrogenase gene from aGlycine max nuclear gene library. The isolated gene codes for the enzyme meso-diaminopimelate dehydrogenase. The coding capacity for the enzyme was originally contained on a 6.6kb fragment in a Charon 4a soybean gene bank. Subcloning of the 6.6kb fragment resulted in the recombinant plasmid pMW75. Subsequent subcloning resulted in a 4.05 kb fragment contained in pLW14. One region of homology was observed upon hybridization to EcoR1 digested soybean DNA. Homologous sequences were also observed in Triticum DNA.Meso-diaminopimelate dehydrogenase activity was demonstrated inGlycine max embryos. Maximum enzymatic activity of the cloned enzyme was observed at a pH of 8.0. The enzyme encoded by the soybean gene has an apparent molecular weight of 67 000."
"9383078","articletitle","Rapid elimination of low-copy DNA sequences in polyploid wheat: a possible mechanism for differentiation of homoeologous chromosomes."
"9383078","abstracttext","To study genome evolution in allopolyploid plants, we analyzed polyploid wheats and their diploid progenitors for the occurrence of 16 low-copy chromosome- or genome-specific sequences isolated from hexaploid wheat. Based on their occurrence in the diploid species, we classified the sequences into two groups: group I, found in only one of the three diploid progenitors of hexaploid wheat, and group II, found in all three diploid progenitors. The absence of group II sequences from one genome of tetraploid wheat and from two genomes of hexaploid wheat indicates their specific elimination from these genomes at the polyploid level. Analysis of a newly synthesized amphiploid, having a genomic constitution analogous to that of hexaploid wheat, revealed a pattern of sequence elimination similar to the one found in hexaploid wheat. Apparently, speciation through allopolyploidy is accompanied by a rapid, nonrandom elimination of specific, low-copy, probably noncoding DNA sequences at the early stages of allopolyploidization, resulting in further divergence of homoeologous chromosomes (partially homologous chromosomes of different genomes carrying the same order of gene loci). We suggest that such genomic changes may provide the physical basis for the diploid-like meiotic behavior of polyploid wheat."

"22820387","abstracttext","Available information on genetically assigned molecular markers is not sufficient for efficient construction of a high-density linkage map in wheat. Here, we report on application of high resolution melting (HRM) analysis using a real-time PCR apparatus to develop single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers linked to a hybrid necrosis gene, Net2, located on wheat chromosome 2D. Based on genomic information on barley chromosome 2H and wheat expressed sequence tag libraries, we selected wheat cDNA sequences presumed to be located near the Net2 chromosomal region, and then found SNPs between the parental Ae. tauschii accessions of the synthetic wheat mapping population. HRM analysis of the PCR products from F(2) individuals' DNA enabled us to assign 44.4% of the SNP-representing cDNAs to chromosome 2D despite the presence of the A and B genomes. In addition, the designed SNP markers were assigned to chromosome 2D of Ae. tauschii. The order of the assigned SNP markers in synthetic hexaploid wheat was confirmed by comparison with the markers in barley and Ae. tauschii. Thus, the SNP-genotyping method based on HRM analysis is a useful tool for development of molecular markers at target loci in wheat."

"23125207","abstracttext","Construction of high-resolution genetic maps is important for genetic and genomic research, as well as for molecular breeding. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the predominant class of genetic variation and can be used as molecular markers. Aegilops tauschii, the D-genome donor of common wheat, is considered a valuable genetic resource for wheat improvement. Our previous study implied that Ae. tauschii accessions can be genealogically divided into two major lineages. In this study, the transcriptome of two Ae. tauschii accessions from each lineage, lineage 1 (L1) and 2 (L2), was sequenced, yielding 9435 SNPs and 739 insertion/deletion polymorphisms (indels) after de novo assembly of the reads. Based on 36 contig sequences, 31 SNPs and six indels were validated on 20 diverse Ae. tauschii accessions. Because almost all of the SNP markers were polymorphic between L1 and L2, and the D-genome donor of common wheat is presumed to belong to L2, these markers are available for D-genome typing in crosses between common wheat varieties and L1-derived synthetic wheat. Due to the conserved synteny between wheat and barley chromosomes, the high-density expressed sequence tag barley map and the hypothetical gene order in barley can be applied to develop markers on target chromosomal regions in wheat."

"23136468","abstracttext","Recently we cloned and characterized the gene for the wheat transcription factor TaWRKY45 and showed that TaWRKY45 was upregulated in response to benzothiadiazole (BTH) and Fusarium head blight (FHB) and that its overexpression conferred enhanced resistance against F. graminearum. To characterize the functional role of TaWRKY45 in the disease resistance of wheat, in the present study we conducted expression analyses of TaWRKY45 with inoculations of powdery mildew and leaf rust and evaluated TaWRKY45-overexpressing wheat plants for resistance to these diseases. TaWRKY45 was upregulated in response to infections with Blumeria graminis, a causal fungus for powdery mildew, and Puccinia triticina, a causal fungus for leaf rust. Constitutive overexpression of the TaWRKY45 transgene conferred enhanced resistance against these two fungi on transgenic wheat plants grown under greenhouse conditions. However, the expression of two resistance-related genes, Pm3 and Lr34, was not induced by the inoculation with powdery mildew in TaWRKY45-overexpressing wheat plants. These results suggest that TaWRKY45 is involved in the defense responses for multiple fungal diseases in wheat but that resistance involving TaWRKY45 differs from at least Pm3 and/or Lr34-related resistance. Our present and previous studies indicate that TaWRKY45 may be potentially utilized to improve a wide range of disease resistance in wheat."

"23326537","abstracttext","The development of alien addition lines is important for transferring useful genes from exotic species into common wheat. A hybrid of common wheat cv. 7182 (2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD) and Psathyrostachys huashanica Keng (2n = 2x = 14, NsNs) via embryo culture produced the novel intergeneric disomic addition line 59-11. The seed morphology of 59-11 resembled the parent 7182 and it exhibited extreme agronomic characteristics, i.e., twin stable spikelets, fertile florets, and multi-kernel clusters. Furthermore, 59-11 produced plump kernels with a high seed-setting percentage during the advanced maturation stage. The line was screened based on genomic in situ hybridization, EST-SSR, EST-STS, and gliadin to identify P. huashanica chromatin in the wheat background. The chromosome number and configuration of 59-11 was 2n = 44 = 22 II and we confirmed the 6Ns disomic chromosome additions based on A-PAGE analysis and molecular markers. The results suggested that the production of twin spikelets and multiple kernels per spike in the wheat-P. huashanica addition line was related to homologous group 6 in the wheat chromosome. This is the first report of the introduction of improved spike traits into common wheat from the alien species P. huashanica and it opens up the possibility of increasing the wheat yield based on this enlarged gene pool."

"23901831","abstracttext","Since its first report in Brazil in 1985, wheat blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae (anamorph: Pyricularia oryzae), has become increasingly important in South America, where the disease is still spreading. We used 11 microsatellite loci to elucidate the population structure of the wheat blast pathogen in wheat fields in central-western, southeastern, and southern Brazil. No subdivision was found among the wheat-infecting populations, consistent with high levels of gene flow across a large spatial scale. Although the clonal fraction was relatively high and the two mating type idiomorphs (MAT1-1 and MAT1-2) were not at similar frequencies, the clone-corrected populations from Distrito Federal and Goiás, Minas Triangle, and São Paulo were in gametic equilibrium. Based on these findings, we propose that populations of the wheat blast pathogen exhibit a mixed reproductive system in which sexual reproduction is followed by the local dispersal of clones. Seedling virulence assays with local wheat cultivars differentiated 14 pathotypes in the current population. Detached head virulence assays differentiated eight virulence groups on the same wheat cultivars. There was no correlation between seedling and head reactions."

"24240851","abstracttext","Chromosome pairing between rye chromosome arm 1RS, present in two wheat-rye translocation stocks, and its wheat homoeologues was induced by introducing the translocations into either a ph1bph1b or a nullisomic 5B background. This rye arm carries a gene conferring resistance to wheat stem rust, but lines carrying the translocation produce a poor quality dough unsuitable for breadmaking. Storage protein markers were utilised along with stem rust reaction to screen for allosyndetic recombinants. From a 1DL-1RS translocation, three lines involving wheat-rye recombination were recovered, along with thirteen lines derived from wheat-wheat homoeologous recombination. From a 1BL-1RS translocation, an additional three allosyndetic recombinants were recovered. Nullisomy for chromosome 5B was as efficacious as the ph1b mutant for induction of allosyndesis, and the former stock is easier to manipulate due to the presence of a 5BL-encoded endosperm protein. The novel wheat-rye chromosomes present in the recombinant lines may enable the rye disease resistance to be exploited without the associated dough quality defect."

Thirty-two of these embryos germinated to give green plants, 31 of which were haploid (21 wheat chromosomes) and 1 of which was euploid (42 wheat chromosomes). Spikelet culture enabled 17.1% of the expected number of embryos to be recovered as haploid plants, a 100-fold improvement on allowing embryos to develop in vivo. Ten haploid plants of 'Chinese Spring' (kr1, kr2), 13 plants of 'Chinese Spring (Hope 5A)' (kr1, Kr2), and 8 of 'Hope' (Kr1, Kr2) were recovered.

Development of wheat-Th. bessarabicum translocation lines by backcrossing the amphiploid in the absence of the Ph1 gene (allowing intergenomic recombination) can assist its utilization in wheat improvement. In this study, six novel wheat-Th. bessarabicum translocation lines involving different chromosome segments (T4BS.4BL-4JL, T6BS.6BL-6JL, T5AS.5AL-5JL, T5DL.5DS-5JS, T2BS.2BL-2JL, and the whole arm translocation T1JS.1AL) were identified and characterized using genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). No background translocations between wheat genomes were observed. The involvement of five of the seven chromosomes and small terminal segments of Th. bessarabicum chromosome arm were important, contributing to both reduced linkage drag of the derived lines by minimizing agronomically deleterious genes from the alien species and high stability including transmission of the alien segment. All three wheat genomes were involved in the translocations with the alien chromosome, and GISH showed the Th. bessarabicum genome was more closely related to the D genome in wheat. All the introgression lines were disomic, stable, and with good morphological characters."

"28327671","abstracttext","Selection is one of the most important forces in crop evolution. Common wheat is a major world food crop and a typical allopolyploid with a huge and complex genome. We applied four approaches to detect loci selected in wheat during domestication and improvement. A total of 7,984 candidate loci were detected, accounting for 23.3% of all 34,317 SNPs analysed, a much higher proportion than estimated in previous reports. We constructed a first generation wheat selection map which revealed the following new insights on genome-wide selection: (1) diversifying selection acted by increasing, decreasing or not affecting gene frequencies; (2) the number of loci under selection during domestication was much higher than that during improvement; (3) the contribution to wheat improvement by the D sub-genome was relatively small due to the bottleneck of hexaploidisation and diversity can be expanded by using synthetic wheat and introgression lines; and (4) clustered selection regions occur throughout the wheat genome, including the centromere regions. This study will not only help future wheat breeding and evolutionary studies, but will also accelerate study of other crops, especially polyploids."

"29597282","abstracttext","Wheat yields have plateaued in recent years and given the growing global population there is a pressing need to develop higher yielding varieties to meet future demand. Genetic manipulation of photosynthesis in elite wheat varieties offers the opportunity to significantly increase yields. However, the absence of a well-defined molecular tool-box of promoters to manipulate leaf processes in wheat hinders advancements in this area. Two promoters, one driving the expression of sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase) and the other fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBPA) from Brachypodium distachyon were identified and cloned into a vector in front of the GUS reporter gene. Both promoters were shown to be functionally active in wheat in both transient assays and in stably transformed wheat plants. Analysis of the stable transformants of wheat (cv. Cadenza) showed that both promoters controlled gus expression throughout leaf development as well as in other green tissues. The availability of these promoters provides new tools for the expression of genes in transgenic wheat leaves and also paves the way for multigene manipulation of photosynthesis to improve yields."

"32480577","abstracttext","To develop a more sustainable agriculture using alternative control strategies, mechanisms involved in the biocontrol ability of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Funneliformis mosseae to protect wheat against the foliar biotrophic pathogen Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici were investigated under controlled conditions. B. graminis infection on wheat leaves was reduced by 78% in mycorrhizal plants compared with non-mycorrhizal ones (control). Wheat roots inoculated with F. mosseae revealed a systemic resistance in leaves to B. graminis, after a 6-week co-culture. Accordingly, this resistance was associated with a significant reduction of B. graminis haustorium formation in epidermal leaf cells of mycorrhizal wheat and an accumulation of phenolic compounds and H2O2 at B. graminis penetration sites. Moreover, gene expression analysis demonstrated upregulation of genes encoding for several defence markers, such as peroxidase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, chitinase 1 and nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related proteins 1 in mycorrhizal wheat only in the absence of the pathogen. This study showed that protection of wheat obtained against B. graminis in response to mycorrhizal inoculation by F. mosseae could be interpreted as a mycorrhiza-induced resistance (MIR). Our findings also suggest that MIR-associated mechanisms impaired the B. graminis development process and corresponded to a systemic elicitation of plant defences rather than a primed state in wheat leaves."

"30544968","abstracttext","Jasmonates are plant hormones that are involved in the regulation of different aspects of plant life, wherein their functions and molecular mechanisms of action in wheat are still poorly studied. With the aim of gaining more insights into the role of jasmonic acid (JA) in wheat growth, development, and responses to environmental stresses, we have generated transgenic bread wheat plants overexpressing Arabidopsis 12-OXOPHYTODIENOATE REDUCTASE 3 ( AtOPR3 ), one of the key genes of the JA biosynthesis pathway. Analysis of transgenic plants showed that AtOPR3 overexpression affects wheat development, including germination, growth, flowering time, senescence, and alters tolerance to environmental stresses. Transgenic wheat plants with high AtOPR3 expression levels have increased basal levels of JA, and up-regulated expression of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE , a jasmonate biosynthesis pathway gene that is known to be regulated by a positive feedback loop that maintains and boosts JA levels. Transgenic wheat plants with high AtOPR3 expression levels are characterized by delayed germination, slower growth, late flowering and senescence, and improved tolerance to short-term freezing. The work demonstrates that genetic modification of the jasmonate pathway is a suitable tool for the modulation of developmental traits and stress responses in wheat."

Clustering based on virulence phenotypes and SSR genotypes grouped the Italian P. triticina isolates into three groups. In the first group, the isolates had virulence phenotypes and SSR genotypes that were similar to the isolates collected from durum wheat. Isolates in the second group were unique because they had virulence similar to the isolates from common wheat but were distinct for SSR genotypes compared to the isolates from durum wheat and from common wheat. Isolates in the third group had virulence phenotypes and SSR genotypes closely related to the isolates from common wheat. The isolates were grouped based on the known or assumed host of origin, virulence phenotype, and SSR genotypes. Measures of F ST and R ST for SSR genotypes, and Φ ST for virulence phenotype were significant, which indicated differentiation among the three groups of isolates. Virulence phenotypes and molecular genotypes were highly correlated with r = 0.74."

"30451367","abstracttext","Calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinase (CIPKs) has been shown to be required for biotic stress tolerance of plants in plant-pathogen interactions. However, the roles of CIPKs in immune signalling of cereal crops and an in-depth knowledge of substrates of CIPKs in response to biotic stress are under debate. In this study, we identified and cloned a CIPK homologue gene TaCIPK10 from wheat. TaCIPK10 was rapidly induced by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) inoculation and salicylic acid (SA) treatment. In vitro phosphorylation assay demonstrated that the kinase activity of TaCIPK10 is regulated by Ca 2+ and TaCBL4. Knockdown TaCIPK10 significantly reduced wheat resistance to Pst, whereas TaCIPK10 overexpression resulted in enhanced wheat resistance to Pst by the induction of defense response in different aspects, including hypersensitive cell death, ROS accumulation and pathogenesis-relative genes expression. Moreover, TaCIPK10 physically interacted with and phosphorylated TaNH2, which was homologous to AtNPR3/4. Silencing of TaNH2 in wheat resulted in enhanced susceptibility to the avirulent Pst race, CYR23, indicating its positive role in wheat resistance. Our results demonstrate that TaCIPK10 positively regulate wheat resistance to Pst as molecular links between of Ca 2+ and downstream components of defense response and TaCIPK10 interacts with and phosphorylates TaNH2 to regulate wheat resistance to Pst."

"32794134","abstracttext","Expression of eukaryotic genes is largely regulated by non-coding RNAs (ncRNA). Sequence variations in the regulatory RNAs may have critical biological consequences including transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation. ncRNA-derived markers thus can be proved useful in molecular breeding, QTL mapping and association studies for trait dissection. In present study, we identified a total of 661 SSRs dwelling in pre-miRNA (15), small nuclear RNA (25) and lncRNA (621). Of these, 46 were validated and 100% amplification success was observed in selected wheat genotypes. A set of 36 ncRNA-SSRs markers was utilized for genetic variability assessment in forty-eight Indian wheat genotypes (which includes bread wheat, durum wheat and relatives). Number of alleles ranged from 1 to 4 with an average of two alleles per SSR locus. Mean PIC, observed heterozygosity and Shannon information index were found to be 0.258, 0.37 and 0.476 which suggests ncRNA-SSRs show higher polymorphism compared to genic SSRs but lower polymorphism compared to genomic SSRs. Thirty-six ncRNA-SSRs showed transferability ranging from 42.1% to 100%. Average genetic dissimilarity among wheat genotypes was found to be 0.29 based on Jaccard's dissimilarity. This is the first report of ncRNA-SSRs in wheat which will be useful for molecular breeding and genetic improvement of wheat."

"2684972","abstracttext","The genes coding for the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein of photosystem II (cab) in wheat are regulated by phytochrome and an endogenous circadian clock. The regulation by these factors has been shown to be at the transcriptional level. Here we show that the phase of cab gene expression is reset by light to dark transition of the previous day. The time of light to dark transition is linearly related to the time of maximal cab gene expression under free running conditions in darkness. We propose that in nature the onset of darkness resets the phase of the circadian clock, which regulates the timing of cab gene expression, so as to anticipate the time of sunrise in the following day."

"9515732","abstracttext","The wcs120 gene is specifically induced by low temperature (LT) and encodes a protein that is thought to play an important role in the cold acclimation process in wheat. To identify the regulatory elements involved in its LT responsiveness, the transient expression activity of different promoter regions was determined using the luciferase reporter gene. The data indicate the involvement of putative enhancer elements, negative and positive regulatory regions in the transcriptional regulation of this gene. The promoter was found to be cold-inducible in different freezing-tolerant and -sensitive monocot and dicot species, suggesting that universal transcription factors responsive to LT may be present in all plants. This promoter could be used to drive the genes needed for LT tolerance in sensitive species."

"11525415","abstracttext","Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation has been successfully applied to the wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola. Both protoplasts and intact cells have been transformed to hygromycin B resistance. Furthermore, A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation using homologous DNA originating from the M. graminicola ABC transporter gene MgAtr2 resulted in the efficient generation of disruption mutants. In 44% of the transformants, disruption of MgAtr2 was achieved and transformants resulted from the integration of a single copy of the transforming DNA. These results indicate that A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation is a useful tool to generate targeted gene disruption in the phytopathogen M. graminicola, where gene targeting by conventional methods is hardly possible."

"17248825","abstracttext","Two hydrophobic endosperm proteins, designated CM3 and CM3', have been purified from appropriate cultivars of tetraploid wheat (T. turgidum) and characterized. They are inherited as though encoded by alleles at a single locus, designated Cm3a and Cm3b, respectively. The net amount of protein molecules has been measured for each of the alleles at one, two and three doses. The amount of CM3' is 50%-65% of that found for CM3. For both, there is a linear gene dosage response. These effects were observed not only in the parental material and the reciprocal F(1) generations, but also in the segregating F(2) generation, indicating that the quantitative difference depends on differences in the structural gene or is controlled by regulatory or modifier gene(s) linked to it."

"20031477","abstracttext","Polyploidy or whole genome duplication (WGD) occurs throughout the evolutionary history of many plants and some animals, including crops such as wheat, cotton, and sugarcane. Recent studies have documented rapid and dynamic changes in genomic structure and gene expression in plant polyploids, which reflects genomic and functional plasticity of duplicate genes and genomes in plants. Common features of uniparental gene regulation and nonadditive gene expression in regulatory pathways responsive to growth, development, and stresses in many polyploids have led to the conclusion that epigenetic mechanisms including chromatin modifications and small RNAs play central roles in shaping molecular and phenotypic novelty that may be selected and domesticated in many polyploid plants and crops."

These results suggest that disruption of Aovps5 may contribute to production of fermented foods."

"19048103","abstracttext_background","Chromatin organizational and topological plasticity, and its functions in gene expression regulation, have been strongly revealed by the analysis of nucleolar dominance in hybrids and polyploids where one parental set of ribosomal RNA (rDNA) genes that are clustered in nucleolar organizing regions (NORs), is rendered silent by epigenetic pathways and heterochromatization. However, information on the behaviour of dominant NORs is very sparse and needed for an integrative knowledge of differential gene transcription levels and chromatin specific domain interactions."
"19048103","abstracttext_methodology/principal findings","Using molecular and cytological approaches in a wheat-rye addition line (wheat genome plus the rye nucleolar chromosome pair 1R), we investigated transcriptional activity and chromatin topology of the wheat dominant NORs in a nucleolar dominance situation. Herein we report dominant NORs up-regulation in the addition line through quantitative real-time PCR and silver-staining technique. Accompanying this modification in wheat rDNA trascription level, we also disclose that perinucleolar knobs of ribosomal chromatin are almost transcriptionally silent due to the residual detection of BrUTP incorporation in these domains, contrary to the marked labelling of intranucleolar condensed rDNA. Further, by comparative confocal analysis of nuclei probed to wheat and rye NORs, we found that in the wheat-rye addition line there is a significant decrease in the number of wheat-origin perinucleolar rDNA knobs, corresponding to a diminution of the rDNA heterochromatic fraction of the dominant (wheat) NORs."
"19048103","abstracttext_conclusions/significance","We demonstrate that inter-specific interactions leading to wheat-origin NOR dominance results not only on the silencing of rye origin NOR loci, but dominant NORs are also modified in their transcriptional activity and interphase organization. The results show a cross-talk between wheat and rye NORs, mediated by ribosomal chromatin dynamics, revealing a conceptual shift from differential amphiplasty to 'mutual amphiplasty' in the nucleolar dominance process."
"23547108","articletitle","Transgenic wheat expressing Thinopyrum intermedium MYB transcription factor TiMYB2R-1 shows enhanced resistance to the take-all disease."
"23547108","abstracttext","The disease take-all, caused by the fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis, is one of the most destructive root diseases of wheat worldwide. Breeding resistant cultivars is an effective way to protect wheat from take-all. However, little progress has been made in improving the disease resistance level in commercial wheat cultivars. MYB transcription factors play important roles in plant responses to environmental stresses. In this study, an R2R3-MYB gene in Thinopyrum intermedium, TiMYB2R-1, was cloned and characterized. The gene sequence includes two exons and an intron. The expression of TiMYB2R-1 was significantly induced following G. graminis infection. An in vitro DNA binding assay proved that TiMYB2R-1 protein could bind to the MYB-binding site cis-element ACI. Subcellular localization assays revealed that TiMYB2R-1 was localized in the nucleus. TiMYB2R-1 transgenic wheat plants were generated, characterized molecularly, and evaluated for take-all resistance. PCR and Southern blot analyses confirmed that TiMYB2R-1 was integrated into the genomes of three independent transgenic wheat lines by distinct patterns and the transgene was heritable. Reverse transcription-PCR and western blot analyses revealed that TiMYB2R-1 was highly expressed in the transgenic wheat lines. Based on disease response assessments for three successive generations, the significantly enhanced resistance to take-all was observed in the three TiMYB2R-1-overexpressing transgenic wheat lines. Furthermore, the transcript levels of at least six wheat defence-related genes were significantly elevated in the TiMYB2R-1 transgenic wheat lines. These results suggest that engineering and overexpression of TiMYB2R-1 may be used for improving take-all resistance of wheat and other cereal crops."
"29642627","articletitle","A Review of the Interactions between Wheat and Wheat Pathogens: Zymoseptoria tritici, Fusarium spp. and Parastagonospora nodorum."
"29642627","abstracttext","Zymoseptoria tritici is a hemibiotrophic pathogen which causes Septoria leaf blotch in wheat. The pathogenesis of the disease consists of a biotrophic phase and a necrotrophic phase. The pathogen infects the host plant by suppressing its immune response in the first stage of infection. Hemibiotrophic pathogens of the genus Fusarium cause Fusarium head blight, and the necrotrophic Parastagonospora nodorum is responsible for Septoria nodorum blotch in wheat. Cell wall-degrading enzymes in plants promote infections by necrotrophic and hemibiotrophic pathogens, and trichothecenes, secondary fungal metabolites, facilitate infections caused by fungi of the genus Fusarium . There are no sources of complete resistance to the above pathogens in wheat. Defense mechanisms in wheat are controlled by many genes encoding resistance traits. In the wheat genome, the characteristic features of loci responsible for resistance to pathogenic infections indicate that at least several dozen genes encode resistance to pathogens. The molecular interactions between wheat and Z . tritici , P . nodorum and Fusarium spp. pathogens have been insufficiently investigated. Most studies focus on the mechanisms by which the hemibiotrophic Z . tritici suppresses immune responses in plants and the role of mycotoxins and effector proteins in infections caused by P . nodorum and Fusarium spp. fungi. Trichothecene glycosylation and effector proteins, which are involved in defense responses in wheat, have been described at the molecular level. Recent advances in molecular biology have produced interesting findings which should be further elucidated in studies of molecular interactions between wheat and fungal pathogens. The Clustered Regularly-Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/ CRISPR associated (CRISPR/Cas) system can be used to introduce targeted mutations into the wheat genome and confer resistance to selected fungal diseases. Host-induced gene silencing and spray-induced gene silencing are also useful tools for analyzing wheat-pathogens interactions which can be used to develop new strategies for controlling fungal diseases."

"19387859","abstracttext","Transgenic wheat is currently being field tested with the intent of eventual commercialization. The development of wheat genotypes with novel traits has raised concerns regarding the presence of volunteer wheat populations and the role they may play in facilitating transgene movement. Here, we report the results of a field experiment that investigated the potential of spring wheat plant population density and crop height to minimize gene flow from a herbicide-resistant (HR) volunteer population to a non-HR crop. Pollen-mediated gene flow (PMGF) between the HR volunteer wheat population and four conventional spring wheat genotypes varying in height was assessed over a range of plant population densities. Natural hybridization events between the two cultivars were detected by phenotypically scoring plants in F(1) populations followed by verification with Mendelian segregation ratios in the F(1:2) families. PMGF was strongly associated with crop yield components, but showed no association with flowering synchrony. Maximum observed PMGF was always less than 0.6%, regardless of crop height and density. The frequency of PMGF in spring wheat decreased exponentially with increasing plant population density, but showed no dependence on either crop genotype or height. However, increasing plant densities beyond the recommended planting rate of 300 cropped wheat plants m(-2) provided no obvious benefit to reducing PMGF. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate a critical plant density of 175-200 cropped wheat plants m(-2) below which PMGF frequencies rise exponentially with decreasing plant density. These results will be useful in the development of mechanistic models and best management practices that collectively facilitate the coexistence of transgenic and nontransgenic wheat crops."

"32065714","abstracttext","The rapid development and application of molecular marker assays have facilitated genomic selection and genome-wide linkage and association studies in wheat breeding. Although PCR-based markers (e.g. simple sequence repeats and functional markers) and genotyping by sequencing have contributed greatly to gene discovery and marker-assisted selection, the release of a more accurate and complete bread wheat reference genome has resulted in the design of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays based on different densities or application targets. Here, we evaluated seven types of wheat SNP arrays in terms of their SNP number, distribution, density, associated genes, heterozygosity and application. The results suggested that the Wheat 660K SNP array contained the highest percentage (99.05%) of genome-specific SNPs with reliable physical positions. SNP density analysis indicated that the SNPs were almost evenly distributed across the whole genome. In addition, 229 266 SNPs in the Wheat 660K SNP array were located in 66 834 annotated gene or promoter intervals. The annotated genes revealed by the Wheat 660K SNP array almost covered all genes revealed by the Wheat 35K (97.44%), 55K (99.73%), 90K (86.9%) and 820K (85.3%) SNP arrays. Therefore, the Wheat 660K SNP array could act as a substitute for other 6 arrays and shows promise for a wide range of possible applications. In summary, the Wheat 660K SNP array is reliable and cost-effective and may be the best choice for targeted genotyping and marker-assisted selection in wheat genetic improvement."
"15644976","articletitle","Synthesis and cytological characterization of trigeneric hybrids of durum wheat with and without Ph1."
"15644976","abstracttext","Wild grasses in the tribe Triticeae, some in the primary or secondary gene pool of wheat, are excellent reservoirs of genes for superior agronomic traits, including resistance to various diseases. Thus, the diploid wheatgrasses Thinopyrum bessarabicum (Savul. and Rayss) A. Love (2n = 2x = 14; JJ genome) and Lophopyrum elongatum (Host) A. Love (2n = 2x = 14; EE genome) are important sources of genes for disease resistance, e.g., Fusarium head blight resistance that may be transferred to wheat. By crossing fertile amphidiploids (2n = 4x = 28; JJEE) developed from F1 hybrids of the 2 diploid species with appropriate genetic stocks of durum wheat, we synthesized trigeneric hybrids (2n = 4x = 28; ABJE) incorporating both the J and E genomes of the grass species with the durum genomes A and B. Trigeneric hybrids with and without the homoeologous-pairing suppressor gene, Ph1, were produced. In the absence of Ph1, the chances of genetic recombination between chromosomes of the 2 useful grass genomes (JE) and those of the durum genomes (AB) would be enhanced. Meiotic chromosome pairing was studied using both conventional staining and fluorescent genomic in situ hybridization (fl-GISH). As expected, the Ph1-intergeneric hybrids showed low chromosome pairing (23.86% of the complement), whereas the trigenerics with ph1b (49.49%) and those with their chromosome 5B replaced by 5D (49.09%) showed much higher pairing. The absence of Ph1 allowed pairing and, hence, genetic recombination between homoeologous chromosomes. Fl-GISH analysis afforded an excellent tool for studying the specificity of chromosome pairing: wheat with grass, wheat with wheat, or grass with grass. In the trigeneric hybrids that lacked chromosome 5B, and hence lacked the Ph1 gene, the wheat-grass pairing was elevated, i.e., 2.6 chiasmata per cell, a welcome feature from the breeding standpoint. Using Langdon 5D(5B) disomic substitution for making trigeneric hybrids should promote homoeologous pairing between durum and grass chromosomes and hence accelerate alien gene transfer into the durum genomes."

"16328439","abstracttext","In this study, we constructed a 22k wheat oligo-DNA microarray. A total of 148,676 expressed sequence tags of common wheat were collected from the database of the Wheat Genomics Consortium of Japan. These were grouped into 34,064 contigs, which were then used to design an oligonucleotide DNA microarray. Following a multistep selection of the sense strand, 21,939 60-mer oligo-DNA probes were selected for attachment on the microarray slide. This 22k oligo-DNA microarray was used to examine the transcriptional response of wheat to salt stress. More than 95% of the probes gave reproducible hybridization signals when targeted with RNAs extracted from salt-treated wheat shoots and roots. With the microarray, we identified 1,811 genes whose expressions changed more than 2-fold in response to salt. These included genes known to mediate response to salt, as well as unknown genes, and they were classified into 12 major groups by hierarchical clustering. These gene expression patterns were also confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Many of the genes with unknown function were clustered together with genes known to be involved in response to salt stress. Thus, analysis of gene expression patterns combined with gene ontology should help identify the function of the unknown genes. Also, functional analysis of these wheat genes should provide new insight into the response to salt stress. Finally, these results indicate that the 22k oligo-DNA microarray is a reliable method for monitoring global gene expression patterns in wheat."

"23940651","abstracttext","Diploid Aegilops umbellulata and Ae. comosa and their natural allotetraploid hybrids Ae. biuncialis and Ae. geniculata are important wild gene sources for wheat. With the aim of assisting in alien gene transfer, this study provides gene-based conserved orthologous set (COS) markers for the U and M genome chromosomes. Out of the 140 markers tested on a series of wheat-Aegilops chromosome introgression lines and flow-sorted subgenomic chromosome fractions, 100 were assigned to Aegilops chromosomes and six and seven duplications were identified in the U and M genomes, respectively. The marker-specific EST sequences were BLAST-ed to Brachypodium and rice genomic sequences to investigate macrosyntenic relationships between the U and M genomes of Aegilops, wheat and the model species. Five syntenic regions of Brachypodium identified genome rearrangements differentiating the U genome from the M genome and from the D genome of wheat. All of them seem to have evolved at the diploid level and to have been modified differentially in the polyploid species Ae. biuncialis and Ae. geniculata. A certain level of wheat-Aegilops homology was detected for group 1, 2, 3 and 5 chromosomes, while a clearly rearranged structure was showed for the group 4, 6 and 7 Aegilops chromosomes relative to wheat. The conserved orthologous set markers assigned to Aegilops chromosomes promise to accelerate gene introgression by facilitating the identification of alien chromatin. The syntenic relationships between the Aegilops species, wheat and model species will facilitate the targeted development of new markers specific for U and M genomic regions and will contribute to the understanding of molecular processes related to allopolyploidization."

Its orthologs in hexaploid wheat were cloned, and the haplotype variation in TaFlo2-A1 was tested for association with TGW."
"29037166","abstracttext_results","The cloned sequences of TaFlo2-A1, TaFlo2-B1 and TaFlo2-D1 contained 23, 23 and 24 exons, respectively. The deduced proteins of TaFlo2-A1 (1734 aa), TaFlo2-B1 (1698 aa) and TaFlo2-D1 (1682 aa) were highly similar (>94%) and exhibited >77% similarity with the rice FLO2 protein. Like the rice FLO2 protein, four tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs were observed in the deduced TaFLO2 protein. An 8-bp InDel (-10 to -17 bp) in the promoter region and five SNPs in first intron of TaFlo2-A1 together formed two haplotypes, TaFlo2-A1a and TaFlo2-A1b, in bread wheat. TaFlo2 was located on homeologous group 2 chromosomes. TaFlo2-A1 was inferred to be located on deletion bin '2AL1-0.85-1.00'. The TaFlo2-A1 haplotypes were characterized in the Chinese Micro Core Collection (MCC) and Pakistani wheat collection using the molecular marker TaFlo2-Indel8. TaFlo2-A1 was found to be associated with TGW but not with grain number per spike (GpS) in both the MCC and Pakistani wheat collections. The frequency of TaFlo2-A1b (positive haplotype) was low in commercial wheat cultivars; thus this haplotype can be selected to improve grain weight without negatively affecting GpS. The expression level of TaFlo2-A1 in developing grains at 5 DAF (days after flowering) was positively correlated with TGW in cultivars carrying the positive haplotype."

"31197605","articletitle","Rapid evolution of α-gliadin gene family revealed by analyzing Gli-2 locus regions of wild emmer wheat."
"31197605","abstracttext","α-Gliadins are a major group of gluten proteins in wheat flour that contribute to the end-use properties for food processing and contain major immunogenic epitopes that can cause serious health-related issues including celiac disease (CD). α-Gliadins are also the youngest group of gluten proteins and are encoded by a large gene family. The majority of the gene family members evolved independently in the A, B, and D genomes of different wheat species after their separation from a common ancestral species. To gain insights into the origin and evolution of these complex genes, the genomic regions of the Gli-2 loci encoding α-gliadins were characterized from the tetraploid wild emmer, a progenitor of hexaploid bread wheat that contributed the AABB genomes. Genomic sequences of Gli-2 locus regions for the wild emmer A and B genomes were first reconstructed using the genome sequence scaffolds along with optical genome maps. A total of 24 and 16 α-gliadin genes were identified for the A and B genome regions, respectively. α-Gliadin pseudogene frequencies of 86% for the A genome and 69% for the B genome were primarily caused by C to T substitutions in the highly abundant glutamine codons, resulting in the generation of premature stop codons. Comparison with the homologous regions from the hexaploid wheat cv. Chinese Spring indicated considerable sequence divergence of the two A genomes at the genomic level. In comparison, conserved regions between the two B genomes were identified that included α-gliadin pseudogenes containing shared nested TE insertions. Analyses of the genomic organization and phylogenetic tree reconstruction indicate that although orthologous gene pairs derived from speciation were present, large portions of α-gliadin genes were likely derived from differential gene duplications or deletions after the separation of the homologous wheat genomes ~ 0.5 MYA. The higher number of full-length intact α-gliadin genes in hexaploid wheat than that in wild emmer suggests that human selection through domestication might have an impact on α-gliadin evolution. Our study provides insights into the rapid and dynamic evolution of genomic regions harboring the α-gliadin genes in wheat."

"31529271","abstracttext_key message","Su1-Ph1, which we previously introgressed into wheat from Aegilops speltoides, is a potent suppressor of Ph1 and a valuable tool for gene introgression in tetraploid wheat. We previously introgressed Su1-Ph1, a suppressor of the wheat Ph1 gene, from Aegilops speltoides into durum wheat cv Langdon (LDN). Here, we evaluated the utility of the introgressed suppressor for inducing introgression of alien germplasm into durum wheat. We built LDN plants heterozygous for Su1-Ph1 that simultaneously contained a single LDN chromosome 5B and a single Ae. searsii chromosome 5S se , which targeted them for recombination. We genotyped 28 BC 1 F 1 and 84 F 2 progeny with the wheat 90-K Illumina single-nucleotide polymorphism assay and detected extensive recombination between the two chromosomes, which we confirmed by non-denaturing fluorescence in situ hybridization (ND-FISH). We constructed BC 1 F 1 and F 2 genetic maps that were 65.31 and 63.71 cM long, respectively. Recombination rates between the 5B and 5S se chromosomes were double the expected rate computed from their meiotic pairing, which we attributed to selection against aneuploid gametes. Recombination rate between 5B and 5S se was depressed compared to that between 5B chromosomes in the proximal region of the long arm. We integrated ND-FISH signals into the genetic map and constructed a physical map, which we used to map a 172,188,453-bp Ph1 region. Despite the location of the region in a low-recombination region of the 5B chromosome, we detected three crossovers in it. Our data show that Su1-Ph1 is a valuable tool for gene introgression and gene mapping based on recombination between homoeologous chromosomes in wheat."

"3870931","abstracttext","The genes for the initiator tRNA(Met)CAU, tRNA(Gly)UCC, tRNA(Thr)GGU, tRNA(Glu)UUC and tRNA(Tyr)GUA and an open reading frame of 62 codons have been identified by sequencing a 2,358 bp BamHI and a 1,378 bp BamHI-Sst2 DNA fragments from wheat chloroplasts. A comparison of the organization of these five tRNA genes and of the open reading frame on the wheat, tobacco and spinach chloroplast genomes suggests that at least three genomic inversions must have occurred during the evolution of the wheat chloroplast genome from a spinach-like ancestor genome. Furthermore, it seems that in wheat the 91 bp intergenic region between the genes for the initiator tRNA(Met) and the gene for tRNA(Gly)UCC is one end-point of the 20 kbp genomic inversion proposed by Palmer and Thompson in the case of maize (Palmer and Thompson 1982). A 119 bp duplication is located at this junction: the first copy comprises the 91 bp of the intergenic region and the first 28 bp of the tRNA(Met) gene, the second copy is found downstream of the tRNA(Met) gene."
"8541498","articletitle","The maize transcription factor Opaque-2 activates a wheat glutenin promoter in plant and yeast cells."
"8541498","abstracttext","The promoter of the wheat low-molecular-weight glutenin (LMWG1D1) gene contains a cis element called the GCN4 like motif (GLM) which has low homology to one class of binding site for the maize endosperm-specific b-ZIP transcription factor Opaque-2 (O2). Previous work has shown that the GLM element interacts with the nuclear factor ESBFII during wheat endosperm development at the time of maximum transcription of the LMWG1D1 gene. In this paper we demonstrate that O2 binds to the GLM element and can activate high levels of transcription from the wheat GLM in transient assays in plant protoplasts and in yeast cells. Lower levels of O2 activation through the GLM element in yeast containing a defective GCN4 gene showed that GCN4 was necessary for high levels of O2 transcriptional activation, indicating that O2 may need to heterodimerise with GCN4 to activate transcription in yeast. These observations provide evidence that the GLM represents a new type of O2 DNA-binding site, and support a postulate that an O2 homologue may activate endosperm-specific expression of wheat storage protein genes."

"9061949","abstracttext","The conserved bifactorial endosperm box found in the promoter of wheat storage protein genes comprises two different cis elements that are thought to be involved in regulating endosperm-specific gene expression. Endosperm nuclear extracts contain binding activities. One is called ESBF-I, which binds to the endosperm motif (EM), and the other is called ESBF-II, which binds to the GCN4-like motif(GLM). Here, we present a functional analysis of the endosperm box of a low-molecular-weight glutenin gene found on the 1D1 chromosome of hexaploid wheat (LMWG-1D1) in transgenic tobacco plants. Our analysis demonstrates the necessity of the EM and GLM for endosperm-specific gene expression and suggests the presence in tobacco of functional counterparts of wheat ESBF-I and ESBF-II. Furthermore, we describe the isolation and characterization of cDNA clones encoding SPA, a seed-specific basic leucine zipper protein from wheat that can activate transcription from the GLMs of the -326-bp LMWG-1D1 promoter in both maize and tobacco leaf protoplasts. This activation is also partially dependent on the presence of functional EMs, suggesting interactions between SPA with ESBF-I-like activities."
"9644833","articletitle","Orthologous DNA sequence variation among 5S ribosomal RNA gene spacer sequences on homoeologous chromosomes 1B, 1D, and 1R of wheat and rye."
"9644833","abstracttext","5S ribosomal gene spacer sequences from the short-spacer arrays of wheat and rye were isolated by PCR. The 29 new DNA sequences displayed noticeable heterogeneity at scattered positions. Nevertheless, based on shared DNA sequence polymorphisms, sequence alignment clearly classified the sequences into three groups. Group-specific primer sets were designed to allow chromosomal assignment by PCR on nullitetrasomic wheat stocks, as well as on wheat-rye translocation and addition lines. The three groups were assigned to orthologous loci 5S-Rrna-B1, 5S-Rrna-D1, and 5S-Rrna-R1 on homoeologous chromosomes 1B, 1D, and 1R, respectively. Hence, group-specific DNA sequence variation could be related to fixed orthologous DNA sequence variation between 5S rRNA multigene families on the homoeologous group 1 chromosomes. In addition, members of the three groups showed fixed orthologous length polymorphism. Four sequenced 5S-Rrna-B1 units, however, had a duplication in the gene encoding region and are probably representatives of a nontranscribed subfamily of 5S rDNA repeating units. The observed chromosome-specific polymorphisms among sequences belonging to a multigene family with thousands of copies suggests that this type of polymorphism may exist in many genes and gene families in polyploid wheats. The implication of this finding in relation to the construction of molecular tools for wheat-genome analysis and manipulation is discussed."

"14770301","abstracttext","Pre-harvest sprouting results in significant economic loss for the grain industry around the world. Lack of adequate seed dormancy is the major reason for pre-harvest sprouting in the field under wet weather conditions. Although this trait is governed by multiple genes it is also highly heritable. A major QTL controlling both pre-harvest sprouting and seed dormancy has been identified on the long arm of barley chromosome 5H, and it explains over 70% of the phenotypic variation. Comparative genomics approaches among barley, wheat and rice were used to identify candidate gene(s) controlling seed dormancy and hence one aspect of pre-harvest sprouting. The barley seed dormancy/pre-harvest sprouting QTL was located in a region that showed good synteny with the terminal end of the long arm of rice chromosome 3. The rice DNA sequences were annotated and a gene encoding GA20-oxidase was identified as a candidate gene controlling the seed dormancy/pre-harvest sprouting QTL on 5HL. This chromosomal region also shared synteny with the telomere region of wheat chromosome 4AL, but was located outside of the QTL reported for seed dormancy in wheat. The wheat chromosome 4AL QTL region for seed dormancy was syntenic to both rice chromosome 3 and 11. In both cases, corresponding QTLs for seed dormancy have been mapped in rice."

In this paper we exploit the recently described CODEHOP primer design and PCR strategy for targeted isolation of homologues in large gene families."
"12153706","abstracttext_results","The method was tested with two different objectives. The first was to analyze the evolution of the CYP98 family of cytochrome P450 genes involved in 3-hydroxylation of phenolic compounds and lignification in a broad range of plant species. The second was to isolate an orthologue of the sorghum glucosyl transferase UGT85B1 and to determine the complexity of the UGT85 family in wheat. P450s of the CYP98 family or closely related sequences were found in all vascular plants. No related sequence was found in moss. Neither extensive duplication of the CYP98 genes nor an orthologue of UGT85B1 were found in wheat. The UGT85A subfamily was however found to be highly variable in wheat."
"12153706","abstracttext_conclusions","Our data are in agreement with the implication of CYP98s in lignification and the evolution of 3-hydroxylation of lignin precursors with vascular plants. High conservation of the CYP98 family strongly argues in favour of an essential function in plant development. Conversely, high duplication and diversification of the UGT85A gene family in wheat suggests its involvement in adaptative response and provides a valuable pool of genes for biotechnological applications. This work demonstrates the high potential of the CODEHOP strategy for the exploration of large gene families in plants."

"12909691","abstracttext","Wcor15, a member of the wheat cold-responsive (Cor) gene family, has been isolated and characterized. The deduced polypeptide WCOR15 (MW=14.7 kDa) showed high homology to the previously identified wheat and barley COR proteins. Southern blot analysis using diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid wheat and diploid Aegilops species showed that the wheat and related wild genomes possessed multiple copies of Wcor15 homologues. Five copies were assigned to the homologous group 2 chromosomes by nulli-tetrasomic analysis. Northern blot analysis showed that expression of Wcor15 was specifically induced by low-temperature. Homologous transcripts accumulated in leaves, and light markedly increased their steady-state levels. Bombardment-mediated transient expression analysis of a chimeric CaMV 35S::Wcor15-GFP construct showed protein-targeting to epidermal guard cell chloroplasts in excised spiderwort leaves. A promoter of Wcor15 contained at least three CRT/DRE-like sequence motifs found in Arabidopsis Cor genes and induced the reporter GUS gene expression in leaves of transgenic tobacco plants under low-temperature and light conditions. These results suggest that the functional Cor gene system involving the CRT/DRE cis-element is conserved in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants."

"12789416","abstracttext","The development of a robust Agrobacterium-mediated transformation protocol for a recalcitrant species like bread wheat requires the identification and optimisation of the factors affecting T-DNA delivery and plant regeneration. We have used immature embryos from range of wheat varieties and the Agrobacterium strain AGL1 harbouring the pGreen-based plasmid pAL156, which contains a T-DNA incorporating the bar gene and a modified uidA (beta-glucuronidase) gene, to investigate and optimise major T-DNA delivery and tissue culture variables. Factors that produced significant differences in T-DNA delivery and regeneration included embryo size, duration of pre-culture, inoculation and co-cultivation, and the presence of acetosyringone and Silwet-L77 in the media. We fully describe a protocol that allowed efficient T-DNA delivery and gave rise to 44 morphologically normal, and fully fertile, stable transgenic plants in two wheat varieties. The transformation frequency ranged from 0.3% to 3.3%. Marker-gene expression and molecular analysis demonstrated that transgenes were integrated into the wheat genome and subsequently transmitted into progeny at Mendelian ratios."

"18051268","abstracttext","Seed coating by a phenazine-producing bacterium, Pseudomonas chlororaphis O6, induced dose-dependent inhibition of germination in wheat and barley seeds, but did not inhibit germination of rice or cucumber seeds. In wheat seedlings grown from inoculated seeds, phenazine production levels near the seed were higher than in the roots. Deletion of the gacS gene reduced transcription from the genes required for phenazine synthesis, the regulatory phzI gene and the biosynthetic phzA gene. The inhibition of seed germination and the induction of systemic disease resistance against a bacterial soft-rot pathogen, Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, were impaired in the gacS and phzA mutants of P chlororaphis O6. Culture filtrates of the gacS and phzA mutants of P chlororaphis 06 did not inhibit seed germination of wheat, whereas that of the wild-type was inhibitory. Our results showed that the production of phenazines by P chlororaphis O6 was correlated with reduced germination of barley and wheat seeds, and the level of systemic resistance in tobacco against E. carotovora."

"18279342","abstracttext","Sulfonates are a key component of the sulfur present in agricultural soils. Their mobilization as part of the soil sulfur cycle is mediated by rhizobacteria, and involves the oxidoreductase AsfA. In this study, the effect of fertilization regime on rhizosphere bacterial asfA distribution was examined at the Broadbalk long-term wheat experiment, Rothamsted, UK, which was established in 1843, and has included a sulfur-free treatment since 2001. Direct isolation of desulfonating rhizobacteria from the wheat rhizospheres led to the identification of several Variovorax and Polaromonas strains, all of which contained the asfA gene. Rhizosphere DNA was isolated from wheat rhizospheres in plots fertilized with inorganic fertilizer with and without sulfur, with farmyard manure or from unfertilized plots. Genetic profiling of 16S rRNA gene fragments [denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)] from the wheat rhizospheres revealed that the level of inorganic sulfate in the inorganic fertilizer was correlated with changes in the general bacterial community structure and the betaproteobacterial community structure in particular. Community analysis at the functional gene level (asfA) showed that 40% of clones in asfAB clone libraries were affiliated to the genus Variovorax. Analysis of asfAB-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) fingerprints showed considerable differences between sulfate-free treatments and those where sulfate was applied. The results suggest the occurrence of desulfonating bacterial communities that are specific to the fertilization regime chosen and that arylsulfonates play an important role in rhizobacterial sulfur nutrition."

"15448895","abstracttext","The capacity to tiller is a key factor that determines plant architecture. Using molecular markers, a single major gene reducing tiller number, formally named the tiller inhibition gene ( tin), was mapped to the short arm of chromosome 1A in wheat. We identified a tightly linked microsatellite marker ( Xgwm136) that may be useful in future marker-assisted selection. The tin gene was mapped to the distal deletion bin of chromosome 1AS (FLM value 0.86) and wheat ESTs which were previously mapped to the same deletion bin were used to identify 18 closely related sequences in the syntenic region of rice chromosome 5. For a subset of wheat ESTs that detected flanking markers for tin, we identified closely related sequences within the most distal 300 kb of rice chromosome 5S. The synteny between the distal chromosome ends of wheat 1AS and rice 5S appeared to be disrupted at the hairy glume locus and seed storage protein loci. We compared map position of tin with other reduced tillering mutants characterised in other cereals to identify possible orthologous genes."

The inheritance of high-level resistance to Septoria tritici blotch was studied in controlled environment experiments. Intraspecific reciprocal crosses were made between hexaploid wheat lines Salamouni, ST6, Katepwa, and Erik, and the tetraploid wheat lines Coulter and 4B1149. Parental, F(1), F(2), F(3), BC(1)F(1), and BC(1)F(2) populations were evaluated for reaction to isolates MG2 and MG96-36 of M. graminicola. Resistance was controlled by incompletely dominant nuclear genes in all cases. Salamouni had three independent resistance genes to isolate MG2, two of which also controlled resistance to isolate MG96-36. ST6 had a single resistance gene to isolate MG2 and none to isolate MG96-36. The resistance genes in Salamouni and ST6 were not allelic. Two independent genes control resistance to isolate MG2 in Coulter, one of which also controlled resistance to isolate MG96-36. These data are consistent with a gene-for-gene interaction in the wheat-M. graminicola pathosystem."
"18065563","articletitle","Characterization of the interaction of a novel Stagonospora nodorum host-selective toxin with a wheat susceptibility gene."
"18065563","abstracttext","Recent work suggests that the Stagonospora nodorum-wheat pathosystem is controlled by host-selective toxins (HSTs; SnToxA, SnTox1, and SnTox2) that interact directly or indirectly with dominant host genes (Tsn1, Snn1, and Snn2) to induce disease. Here we describe and characterize a novel HST designated SnTox3, and the corresponding wheat sensitivity/susceptibility gene identified on chromosome arm 5BS, which we designated as Snn3. SnTox3 is a proteinaceous necrosis-inducing toxin between 10 and 30 kD in size. The S. nodorum isolates Sn1501 (SnToxA-, SnTox2+, and SnTox3+), SN15 (SnToxA+, SnTox2+, and SnTox3+), and SN15KO18, a strain of SN15 with a disrupted form of SnToxA, were evaluated on a population of wheat recombinant inbred lines. A compatible Snn3-SnTox3 interaction played a significant role in the development of disease caused by isolates Sn1501 and SN15KO18, with Snn2 being epistatic to Snn3. Snn3 was not significantly associated with disease caused by SN15 presumably due to the major effects observed for Snn2 and Tsn1, which were largely additive. This work introduces a fourth HST produced by S. nodorum and builds on the notion that the S. nodorum-wheat pathosystem is largely based on multiple host-toxin interactions that follow an inverse gene-for-gene scenario."

"18839130","abstracttext","Variation in photoperiod response plays an important role in adapting crops to agricultural environments. In hexaploid wheat, mutations conferring photoperiod insensitivity (flowering after a similar time in short or long days) have been mapped on the 2B (Ppd-B1) and 2D (Ppd-D1) chromosomes in colinear positions to the 2H Ppd-H1 gene of barley. No A genome mutation is known. On the D genome, photoperiod insensitivity is likely to be caused by deletion of a regulatory region that causes misexpression of a member of the pseudo-response regulator (PRR) gene family and activation of the photoperiod pathway irrespective of day length. Photoperiod insensitivity in tetraploid (durum) wheat is less characterized. We compared pairs of near-isogenic lines that differ in photoperiod response and showed that photoperiod insensitivity is associated with two independent deletions of the A genome PRR gene that cause altered expression. This is associated with induction of the floral regulator FT. The A genome deletions and the previously described D genome deletion of hexaploid wheat remove a common region, suggesting a shared mechanism for photoperiod insensitivity. The identification of the A genome mutations will allow characterization of durum wheat germplasm and the construction of genotypes with novel combinations of photoperiod insensitive alleles."

"20373960","abstracttext","Dark pigmented fungi of the Gaeumannomyces-Phialophora complex were isolated from the roots of wheat grown in fields in eastern Washington State. These fungi were identified as Phialophora spp. on the basis of morphological and genetic characteristics. The isolates produced lobed hyphopodia on wheat coleoptiles, phialides, and hyaline phialospores. Sequence comparison of internal transcribed spacer regions indicated that the Phialophora isolates were clearly separated from other Gaeumannomyces spp. Primers AV1 and AV3 amplified 1.3-kb portions of an avenacinase-like gene in the Phialophora isolates. Phylogenetic trees of the avenacinase-like gene in the Phialophora spp. also clearly separated them from other Gaeumannomyces spp. The Phialophora isolates were moderately virulent on wheat and barley and produced confined black lesions on the roots of wild oat and two oat cultivars. Among isolates tested for their sensitivity to 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG), the 90% effective dose values were 11.9 to 48.2 microg ml(-1). A representative Phialophora isolate reduced the severity of take-all on wheat caused by two different isolates of Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici. To our knowledge, this study provides the first report of an avenacinase-like gene in Phialophora spp. and demonstrated that the fungus is significantly less sensitive to 2,4-DAPG than G. graminis var. tritici."

"19652174","abstracttext","Most elite wheat varieties cannot be crossed with related species thereby restricting greatly the germplasm that can be used for alien introgression in breeding programs. Inhibition to crossability is controlled genetically and a number of QTL have been identified to date, including the major gene Kr1 on 5BL and SKr, a strong QTL affecting crossability between wheat and rye on chromosome 5BS. In this study, we used a recombinant SSD population originating from a cross between the poorly crossable cultivar Courtot (Ct) and the crossable line MP98 to characterize the major dominant effect of SKr and map the gene at the distal end of the chromosome near the 5B homeologous GSP locus. Colinearity with barley and rice was used to saturate the SKr region with new markers and establish orthologous relationships with a 54-kb region on rice chromosome 12. In total, five markers were mapped within a genetic interval of 0.3 cM and 400 kb of BAC contigs were established on both sides of the gene to lay the foundation for map-based cloning of SKr. Two SSR markers completely linked to SKr were used to evaluate a collection of crossable wheat progenies originating from primary triticale breeding programs. The results confirm the major effect of SKr on crossability and the usefulness of the two markers for the efficient introgression of crossability in elite wheat varieties."

"23381807","abstracttext","The majority of genes present in the hexaploid bread wheat genome are present as three homoeologs. Here, we describe the three homoeologous orthologs of the barley cleistogamy gene Cly1, a member of the AP2 gene family. As in barley, the wheat genes (designated TaAP2-A, -B and -D) map to the sub-telomeric region of the long arms of the group 2 chromosomes. The structure and pattern of transcription of the TaAP2 homoeologs were similar to those of Cly1. Transcript abundance was high in the florets, and particularly in the lodicule. The TaAP2 message was cleaved at its miR172 target sites. The set of homoeolog-specific PCR assays developed will be informative for identifying either naturally occurring or induced cleistogamous alleles at each of the three wheat homoeologs. By combining such alleles via conventional crossing, it should be possible to generate a cleistogamous form of bread wheat, which would be advantageous both with respect to improving the level of the crop's resistance against the causative pathogen of fusarium head blight, and for controlling pollen-mediated gene flow to and from genetically modified cultivars."

"22830423","abstracttext","The Stagonospora nodorum-wheat interaction involves multiple pathogen-produced necrotrophic effectors that interact directly or indirectly with specific host gene products to induce the disease Stagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB). Here, we used a tetraploid wheat mapping population to identify and characterize a sixth effector-host gene interaction in the wheat-S. nodorum system. Initial characterization of the effector SnTox5 indicated that it is a proteinaceous necrotrophic effector that induces necrosis on host lines harbouring the Snn5 sensitivity gene, which was mapped to the long arm of wheat chromosome 4B. On the basis of ultrafiltration, SnTox5 is probably in the size range 10-30 kDa. Analysis of SNB development in the mapping population indicated that the SnTox5-Snn5 interaction explains 37%-63% of the variation, demonstrating that this interaction plays a significant role in disease development. When the SnTox5-Snn5 and SnToxA-Tsn1 interactions occurred together, the level of SNB was increased significantly. Similar to several other interactions in this system, the SnTox5-Snn5 interaction is light dependent, suggesting that multiple interactions may exploit the same pathways to cause disease."
"21060985","articletitle","An accurate DNA marker assay for stem rust resistance gene Sr2 in wheat."
"21060985","abstracttext","The stem rust resistance gene Sr2 has provided broad-spectrum protection against stem rust (Puccinia graminis Pers. f. sp. tritici) since its wide spread deployment in wheat from the 1940s. Because Sr2 confers partial resistance which is difficult to select under field conditions, a DNA marker is desirable that accurately predicts Sr2 in diverse wheat germplasm. Using DNA sequence derived from the vicinity of the Sr2 locus, we developed a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker that is associated with the presence or absence of the gene in 115 of 122 (95%) diverse wheat lines. The marker genotype predicted the absence of the gene in 100% of lines which were considered to lack Sr2. Discrepancies were observed in lines that were predicted to carry Sr2 but failed to show the CAPS marker. Given the high level of accuracy observed, the marker provides breeders with a selection tool for one of the most important disease resistance genes of wheat."
"21509697","articletitle","Rye-derived powdery mildew resistance gene Pm8 in wheat is suppressed by the Pm3 locus."
"21509697","abstracttext","Genetic suppression of disease resistance is occasionally observed in hexaploid wheat or in its interspecific crosses. The phenotypic effects of genes moved to wheat from relatives with lower ploidy are often smaller than in the original sources, suggesting the presence of modifiers or partial inhibitors in wheat, especially dilution effects caused by possible variation at orthologous loci. However, there is little current understanding of the underlying genetics of suppression. The discovery of suppression in some wheat genotypes of the cereal rye chromosome 1RS-derived gene Pm8 for powdery mildew resistance offered an opportunity for analysis. A single gene for suppression was identified at or near the closely linked storage protein genes Gli-A1 and Glu-A3, which are also closely associated with the Pm3 locus on chromosome 1AS. The Pm3 locus is a complex of expressed alleles and pseudogenes embedded among Glu-A3 repeats. In the current report, we explain why earlier work indicated that the mildew suppressor was closely associated with specific Gli-A1 and Glu-A3 alleles, and predict that suppression of Pm8 involves translated gene products from the Pm3 locus."

"23792912","abstracttext","Gall midges induce formation of host nutritive cells and alter plant metabolism to utilize host resources. Here we show that the gene Mayetiola destructor susceptibility-1 on wheat chromosome 3AS encodes a small heat-shock protein and is a major susceptibility gene for infestation of wheat by the gall midge M. destructor, commonly known as the Hessian fly. Transcription of Mayetiola destructor susceptibility-1 and its homoeologs increases upon insect infestation. Ectopic expression of Mayetiola destructor susceptibility-1 or induction by heat shock suppresses resistance of wheat mediated by the resistance gene H13 to Hessian fly. Silencing of Mayetiola destructor susceptibility-1 by RNA interference confers immunity to all Hessian fly biotypes on normally susceptible wheat genotypes. Mayetiola destructor susceptibility-1-silenced plants also show reduced lesion formation due to infection by the powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici. Modification of susceptibility genes may provide broad and durable sources of resistance to Hessian fly, B. graminis f. sp. tritici, and other pests."

"23933226","abstracttext","Genetic characterization of the Arabidopsis lesion simulating disease 1 (lsd1) mutant, a lesion mimic mutant (LMM), has revealed the essential role of AtLSD1 in the negative regulation of cell death and disease resistance. The three zinc-finger motifs found in AtLSD1 revealed a novel plant-specific gene family, whose members are significantly related to programmed cell death (PCD). In this study, we characterized a functional homologue to AtLSD1, TaLSD1, in the wheat-stripe rust fungus pathosystem. The expression of TaLSD1 was differentially induced during incompatible and compatible interactions between wheat and Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) and was up-regulated by oxidative stress generated by methyl viologen (MV). TaLSD1 was found to be predominately localized in the nucleus of onion epidermal cell. Transient overexpression assays in Nicotiana benthamiana demonstrated that TaLSD1 partially inhibited programmed cell death triggered by a mouse Bax protein, whereas expression of TaLSD1 alone had no influence on the phenotype of tobacco. Knocking down the expression of TaLSD1 through virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) increased wheat resistance against Pst accompanied by an enhanced hypersensitive response (HR), an increase in PR1 gene expression and a reduction in Pst hyphal growth. Our results suggest that TaLSD1 functions negatively in regulating the plant hypersensitive cell death and is involved in disease resistance of wheat against the stripe rust pathogen."

"24119405","abstracttext","Tan spot, caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, is an important foliar disease of wheat. In the present study, a gene named glucanase gene (GLU1) encoding a putative exo-1,3-β-glucanase was cloned from a race five isolate of P. tritici-repentis. Transcription profile analysis of the GLU1 gene showed a carbon source control of the accumulation of transcript, which is strongly induced in minimal medium but depressed in rich medium. A time-course study of the infection process of the wild-type isolate on a susceptible wheat genotype revealed that the transcript level of GLU1 increased more than 8000-fold 8 h after inoculation. To study its potential function in pathogenicity, GLU1 was silenced via a sense and antisense mediated silencing mechanism. One transformant named C1 showed significantly reduced growth and sporulation relative to the wild-type. Cytological analysis of the infection revealed that C1 produced significantly lower numbers of germ tubes and appressoria than the wild-type strain on susceptible wheat leaves. This strain, as well as another two transformants, caused significantly less disease symptoms relative to the wild-type after inoculation onto a susceptible wheat genotype. These results indicate that GLU1 contributes to the development and virulence of P. tritici-repentis."

"24372025","abstracttext","Copper is an essential micronutrient for plant growth and development, and copper transporter plays a pivotal role for keeping copper homeostasis. However, little is known about copper transporters in wheat. Here, we report a novel copper transporter gene family, TaCT1, in common wheat. Three TaCT1 homoeologous genes were isolated and assigned to group 5 chromosomes. Each of the TaCT1 genes (TaCT1-5A, -5B or -5D) possesses 12 transmembrane domains. TaCT1 genes exhibited higher transcript levels in leaf than in root, culm and spikelet. Excess copper down-regulated the transcript levels of TaCT1 and copper deficiency-induced TaCT1 expression. Subcellular experiments localized the TaCT1 to the Golgi apparatus. Yeast expression experiments and virus-induced gene silencing analysis indicated that the TaCT1 functioned in copper transport. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that three amino acid residues, Met(35), Met(38) and Cys(365), are required for TaCT1 function. Phylogenetic and functional analyses suggested that homologous genes shared high similarity with TaCT1 may exist exclusively in monocot plants. Our work reveals a novel wheat gene family encoding major facilitator superfamily (MFS)-type copper transporters, and provides evidence for their functional involvement in promoting copper uptake and keeping copper homeostasis in common wheat."

"25095900","abstracttext","Wheat provides 20 % of the calories consumed worldwide. Powdery mildew infections of wheat can result in more than 30 % yield loss but it has been demonstrated that wheat overexpressing Pm3b, an allele of the R gene Pm3, has enhanced resistance against powdery mildew under field conditions. A gene expression profile study using GeneChip Wheat Genome Array and Fluidigm 96.96 Dynamic Arrays was performed to obtain insights into the mode of action of Pm3b and to elucidate the molecular basis of pleiotropic effects observed in three out of four independent transgenic events under field conditions. A cluster analysis of the microarray data and a principal component analysis of the Fluidigm 96.96 Dynamic Arrays data showed that transgenic lines and null segregants grouped together. The microarray analysis of samples from fungicide-treated plants revealed that significantly fewer genes were differentially expressed in Pm3b#1 than in Pm3b#2, which had a pleiotropic phenotype in the field, compared to their null segregants. Together, our data provide evidence that the environment influenced gene expression in the Pm3b lines more than the transgene itself."

The highest transient β-glucuronidase expression was obtained when scuttles were bombarded at 1100 psi with a 9-cm target distance. Using the optimized parameters, the transformation of the common wheat variety Xindong No. 26 was carried out using the linear 1Dx5. Three transgenic plants were identified from 1003 transgenic plants, yielding a transformation frequency of 0.4%. A sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis confirmed that the 1Dx5 gene was expressed in 4 T1 seeds of the transgenic plants. These experiments indicate the possibility of obtaining marker-free transgenic wheat plants via particle bombardment using the minimal gene cassettes with the particle bombardment parameters."

"25163935","abstracttext_key message","We report a new stripe rust resistance gene on chromosome 7AS in wheat and molecular markers useful for transferring it to other wheat genotypes. Several new races of the stripe rust pathogen have established throughout the wheat growing regions of China in recent years. These new races are virulent to most of the designated seedling resistance genes limiting the resistance sources. It is necessary to identify new genes for diversification and for pyramiding different resistance genes in order to achieve more durable resistance. We report here the identification of a new resistance gene, designated as Yr61, in Chinese wheat cultivar Pindong 34. A mapping population of 208 F2 plants and 128 derived F2:3 lines in a cross between Mingxian 169 and Pindong 34 was evaluated for seedling stripe rust response. A genetic map consisting of eight resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP), two sequence-tagged site (STS) and four simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers was constructed. Yr61 was located on the short arm of chromosome 7A and flanked by RGAP markers Xwgp5467 and Xwgp5765 about 1.9 and 3.9 cM in distance, which were successfully converted into STS markers STS5467 and STS5765b, respectively. The flanking STS markers could be used for marker-assisted selection of Yr61 in breeding programs."

"25951496","abstracttext","In cells, metallochaperones are important proteins that safely transport metal ions. Heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant proteins (HIPPs) are metallochaperones that contain a metal binding domain and a CaaX isoprenylation motif at the carboxy-terminal end. To investigate the roles of wheat heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant protein (TaHIPP) genes in plant development and in stress responses, we isolated cDNA encoding the wheat TaHIPP1 gene, which contains a heavy metal-associated domain, nuclear localisation signals and an isoprenylation motif (CaaX motif). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that the TaHIPP1 gene was differentially expressed under biotic and abiotic stresses. Specifically, TaHIPP1 expression was up-regulated by ABA exposure or wounding. Additionally, TaHIPP1 over-expression in yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) significantly increased the cell growth rate under Cu(2+) and high salinity stresses. The nuclear localisation of the protein was confirmed with confocal laser scanning microscopy of epidermal onion cells after particle bombardment with chimeric TaHIPP1-GFP constructs. In addition, TaHIPP1 was shown to enhance the susceptibility of wheat to Pst as determined by virus-induced gene silencing. These data indicate that TaHIPP1 is an important component in defence signalling pathways and may play a crucial role in the defence response of wheat to biotic and certain abiotic stresses."

"25759705","abstracttext","We examine the contribution of next generation sequencing (NGS) to our understanding of the interaction between the fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici and its wheat host. Recent interspecific whole genome comparisons between Z. tritici and its close relatives provide evidence that Z. tritici has undergone strong adaptive evolution, which is attributed to specialization by Z. tritici on wheat. We also assess the contribution of recent RNA sequencing datasets toward identifying pathogen genes and mechanisms critical for disease. While these studies have yet to report a major effector gene, they illustrate that assembling reads to the reference genome is a robust method to identify fungal transcripts from in planta infections. They also highlight the strong influence that the wheat cultivar has on effector gene expression. Lastly, we suggest future directions for NGS-guided approaches to address largely unanswered questions related to cultivar and lifecycle dependent gene expression and propose that future experiments with Z. tritici be conducted on a single wheat cultivar to enable comparisons across experiments."

"27436915","abstracttext","Genetic transformation is one of the most widely used technique in crop improvement. However, most of the binary vectors used in this technique, especially cloning based, contain antibiotic genes as selection marker that raise serious consumer and environmental concerns; moreover, they could be transferred to non-target hosts with deleterious effects. Therefore, the goal of this study was reconstruction of the widely used pBI121 binary vector by substituting the harmful antibiotic selection marker gene with a less-harmful selection marker, Basta (herbicide resistance gene). The generated vectors were designated as pBI121NB and pBI121CB, in which Basta gene was expressed under the control of Nos or CaMV 35S promoter, respectively. The successful integration of the new inserts into both the vectors was confirmed by PCR, restriction digestion and sequencing. Both these vectors were used in transforming Arabidopsis, Egyptian wheat and barley varieties using LBA4404 and GV3101 Agrobacterium strains. The surfactant Tween-20 resulted in an efficient transformation and the number of Arabidopsis transformants was about 6-9 %. Soaked seeds of wheat and barley were transformed with Agrobacterium to introduce the bacteria to the growing shoot apices. The percentage of transgenic lines was around 16-17 and 14-15 % for wheat and barley, respectively. The quantitative studies presented in this work showed that both LBA4404 and GV3101 strains were suitable for transforming Egyptian wheat and barley."

"28654760","abstracttext","Aegilops is a genus belonging to the family Poaceace, which have played an indispensible role in the evolution of bread wheat and continues to do so by transferring genes by wide hybridization. Being the secondary gene pool of wheat, gene transfer from Aegilops poses difficulties and segregation distortion is common. Gametocidal genes are the most well characterized class of segregation distorters reported in interspecific crosses of wheat with Aegilops. These ""selfish"" genetic elements ensure their preferential transmission to progeny at the cost of gametes lacking them without providing any phenotypic benefits to the plant, thereby causing a proportional reduction in fertility. Gametocidal genes (Gc) have been reported in different species of Aegilops belonging to the sections Aegilops (Ae. geniculata and Ae. triuncialis), Cylindropyrum (Ae. caudata and Ae. cylindrica), and Sitopsis (Ae. longissima, Ae. sharonensis, and Ae. speltoides). Gametocidal activity is mostly confined to 2, 3, and 4 homeologous groups of C, S, S 1 , S sh , and M g genomes. Removal of such genes is necessary for successful alien gene introgression and can be achieved by mutagenesis or allosyndetic pairing. However, there are some instances where Gc genes are constructively utilized for development of deletion stocks in wheat, improving genetic variability and chromosome engineering."

"28182966","abstracttext","The stripe rust resistance gene, Yr26, is commonly used in wheat production. Identification of Yr26 resistance related genes is important for better understanding of the resistance mechanism. TaRab18, a putative small GTP-binding protein, was screened as a resistance regulated gene as it showed differential expression between the Yr26-containing resistant wheat and the susceptible wheat at different time points after Pst inoculation. TaRab18 contains four typical domains (GI to GIV) of the small GTP-binding proteins superfamily and five domains (RabF1 to RabF5) specific to the Rab subfamily. From the phylogenetic tree that TaRab18 was identified as belonging to the RABC1 subfamily. Chromosome location analysis indicated that TaRab18 and its homeoalles were on the homeologous group 7 chromosomes, and the Pst induced TaRab18 was on the 7 B chromosome. Functional analysis by virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) indicated that TaRab18 was positively involved in the stripe rust resistance through regulating the hypersensitive response, and Pst can develop on the leaves of TaRab18 silenced 92R137. However, over-expression of TaRab18 in susceptible Yangmai158 did not enhance its resistance dramatically, only from 9 grade in Yangmai158 to 8 grade in the transgenic plant. However, histological observation indicated that the transgenic plants with over-expressed TaRab18 showed a strong hypersensitive response at the early infection stage. The research herein, will improve our understanding of the roles of Rab in wheat resistance."

"28387243","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is the major causal agent of fusarium head blight in wheat, a serious disease worldwide. Linoleic acid isomerase (LAI) catalyses the transformation of linoleic acid (LA) to conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which is beneficial for human health. We characterised a cis-12 LAI gene of F. graminearum (FGSG_02668; FgLAI12), which was downregulated by salicylic acid (SA), a plant defence hormone. Disruption of FgLAI12 in F. graminearum resulted in decreased accumulation of cis-9,trans-11 CLA, enhanced sensitivity to SA, and increased accumulation of LA and SA in wheat spikes during infection. In addition, mycelial growth, accumulation of deoxynivalenol, and pathogenicity in wheat spikes were reduced. Re-introduction of a functional FgLAI12 gene into ΔFgLAI12 recovered the wild-type phenotype. Fluorescent microscopic analysis showed that FgLAI12 protein was usually expressed in the septa zone of conidia and the vacuole of hyphae, but was expressed in the cell membrane of hyphae in response to exogenous LA, which may be an element of LA metabolism during infection by F. graminearum. The cis-12 LAI enzyme encoded by FgLAI12 is critical for fungal response to SA, mycelial growth and virulence in wheat. The gene FgLAI12 is potentially valuable for biotechnological synthesis of cis-9,trans-11 CLA."

"30540828","abstracttext","Thinopyrum elongatum (Host) D.R. Dewey has served as an important gene source for wheat breeding improvement for many years. The exact characterization of its chromosomes is important for the detailed analysis of prebreeding materials produced with this species. The major aim of this study was to identify and characterize new molecular markers to be used for the rapid analysis of E genome chromatin in wheat background. Sixty of the 169 conserved orthologous set (COS) markers tested on diverse wheat-Th. elongatum disomic/ditelosomic addition lines were assigned to various Th. elongatum chromosomes and will be used for marker-assisted selection. The macrosyntenic relationship between the wheat and Th. elongatum genomes was investigated using EST sequences. Several rearrangements were revealed in homoeologous chromosome groups 2, 5, 6 and 7, while chromosomes 1 and 4 were conserved. Molecular cytogenetic and marker analysis showed the presence of rearranged chromosome involved in 6ES and 2EL arms in the 6E disomic addition line. The selected chromosome arm-specific COS markers will make it possible to identify gene introgressions in breeding programmes and will also be useful in the development of new chromosome-specific markers, evolutionary analysis and gene mapping."

"30282993","abstracttext","Yellow rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a devastating fungal disease threatening much of global wheat production. Race-specific resistance (R)-genes are used to control rust diseases, but the rapid emergence of virulent Pst races has prompted the search for a more durable resistance. Here, we report the cloning of Yr15, a broad-spectrum R-gene derived from wild emmer wheat, which encodes a putative kinase-pseudokinase protein, designated as wheat tandem kinase 1, comprising a unique R-gene structure in wheat. The existence of a similar gene architecture in 92 putative proteins across the plant kingdom, including the barley RPG1 and a candidate for Ug8, suggests that they are members of a distinct family of plant proteins, termed here tandem kinase-pseudokinases (TKPs). The presence of kinase-pseudokinase structure in both plant TKPs and the animal Janus kinases sheds light on the molecular evolution of immune responses across these two kingdoms."
"30722591","articletitle","Genetic Analysis of Adult Plant Resistance to Yellow Rust and Leaf Rust in Common Spring Wheat Quaiu 3."
"30722591","abstracttext","Identifying and utilizing rust resistance genes in wheat has been hampered by the continuous and rapid emergence of new pathogen races. A major focus of many wheat breeding programs is achieving durable adult plant resistance (APR) to yellow (stripe) rust (YR) and leaf (brown) rust (LR), caused by Puccinia striiformis and P. triticina, respectively. This study aimed to determine the genetic basis of resistance to YR and LR in the common spring wheat 'Quaiu 3'. To that end, we evaluated 198 F 5 recombinant inbred lines (RILs), derived from a cross of susceptible 'Avocet-YrA' with Quaiu 3, for APR to LR and YR in artificially inoculated field trials conducted in Mexico during the 2009 and 2010 growing seasons. High narrow-sense heritability (h 2 ) estimates, ranging between 0.91 and 0.95, were obtained for both LR and YR disease severities for both years. The quantitative and qualitative approaches used to estimate gene numbers showed that, in addition to known resistance genes, there are at least two to three APR genes associated with LR and YR resistance in the RIL population. The moderately effective race-specific resistance gene Lr42 and the pleiotropic slow-rusting APR gene Lr46/Yr29 were found to interact with additional unidentified APR genes. The unidentified APR genes should be of particular interest for further characterization through molecular mapping, and for utilization by wheat breeding programs."

"31773177","abstracttext_key message","A new greenbug resistance gene Gb8 conferring broad resistance to US greenbug biotypes was identified in hard red winter wheat line PI 595379-1 and was mapped to the terminal region of chromosome 7DL. Greenbug [Schizaphis graminum (Rondani)] is a worldwide insect pest that poses a serious threat to wheat production. New greenbug resistance genes that can be readily used in wheat breeding are urgently needed. The objective of this study was to characterize a greenbug resistance gene in PI 595379-1, a single plant selection from PI 595379. Genetic analysis of response to greenbug biotype E in an F 2:3 population derived from a cross between PI 595379-1 and PI 243735 indicated that a single gene, designated Gb8, conditioned resistance. Linkage analysis placed Gb8 in a 2.7-Mb interval in the terminal bin of chromosome 7DL (7DL3-082-1.0), spanning 595.6 to 598.3 Mb in the Chinese Spring IWGSC RefSeq version 1.0 reference sequence. Gb8 co-segregated with a newly developed SSR marker Xstars508, positioned at 596.4 Mb in the reference sequence. Allelism tests showed that Gb8 was different from three permanently named genes on the same chromosome arm and the estimated genetic distance between Gb8 and Gb3 was 15.35 ± 1.35 cM. Gb8 can be directly used in wheat breeding to enhance greenbug resistance."

"31196379","abstracttext","Dehydrins are involved in the prevention of osmotic damage in plants. Many studies have shown that overexpression of dehydrin genes can enhance the osmotic stress tolerance in transgenic plants. Our previous studies showed a YnSKn-type dehydrin gene WZY2 could be induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG), cold, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA). In the present study, we examined the phenotype and physiological indices in a dehydrin gene WZY2 RNA interference (RNAi) lines in wheat. Real-time PCR indicated a depressed WZY2 gene expression in transformed wheat. Furthermore, transgenic wheat showed lower relative water content, oxidative-related enzyme activities and higher malondialdehyde (MDA) content than wild-type bread wheat (Zhengyin No.1) under osmotic stress. Overexpression of the WZY2 in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. revealed a significant increase in tolerance to drought stress. Further studies also showed that WZY2 could participate in ABA-induced stomatal closure. These results demonstrated a key function of WZY2 in plant response to osmotic stress."

"31554871","abstracttext","We dissected the genetic basis of total spikelet number (TSN) along with other traits, viz. spike length (SL) and flowering time (FT) in a panel of 518 elite European winter wheat varieties. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) based on 39,908 SNP markers revealed highly significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) for TSN on chromosomes 2D, 7A, and 7B, for SL on 5A, and FT on 2D, with 2D-QTL being the functional marker for the gene Ppd-D1. The physical region of the 7A-QTL for TSN revealed the presence of a wheat ortholog (TaAPO-A1) to APO1-a rice gene that positively controls the spikelet number on the panicles. Interspecific analyses of the TaAPO-A1 orthologs showed that it is a highly conserved gene important for floral development and present in a wide range of terrestrial plants. Intraspecific studies of the TaAPO-A1 across wheat genotypes revealed a polymorphism in the conserved F-box domain, defining two haplotypes. A KASP marker developed on the polymorphic site showed a highly significant association of TaAPO-A1 with TSN, explaining 23.2% of the total genotypic variance. Also, the TaAPO-A1 alleles showed weak but significant differences for SL and grain yield. Our results demonstrate the importance of wheat sequence resources to identify candidate genes for important traits based on genetic analyses."

(1983) Theor. Appl. Genet. 67, 87-96]. Glutenins are large molecular weight aggregated proteins of grain endosperm, and major determinants of bread making quality of wheat. Of the two clones obtained one was fully characterized. It contained the sequence of the high molecular weight subunit of glutenin. The amino acid sequence derived from the gene sequence reveals a mature protein (817 amino acids) with a highly repeated structure of two different motifs corresponding to the high glutamine (35.7%), glycine (20.1%) and proline (13.1%) content. The gene does not contain an intron, and possesses a typical eukaryotic promoter; the RNA initiation site is 25-30 bases downstream."

The Sal I 11.2 kb fragment of DNA cloned from a size-fractionated genome library contained eight introns and an open reading frame that encoded 500 amino acids (M(r) 55,445). The structure deduced for the carboxypeptidase from rice was very similar to those of type III serine carboxypeptidases from barley and wheat. The extent of homology of the amino acid sequence to that of these carboxypeptidases from barley and wheat was 92.3% and 87.2%, respectively. The accumulation of mRNA for the rice carboxypeptidase was conspicuous in germinating endosperms that contained aleurone layers, but levels were lower in leaves and roots. The abundance of the mRNA in endosperms was enhanced by gibberellic acid (GA) and accumulation of the mRNA was inhibited by abscisic acid (ABA). The rice gene for carboxypeptidase contained some pyrimidine boxes (C/TCTTTTC/T), in the 5' flanking region, which are a characteristic of a GA-responsive gene."

An HSP70 gene family-specific degenerate primer was used as a 5' primer in place of the arbitrary primer used in the original technique. We cloned and sequenced three cDNA fragments that were differentially expressed in heat stressed wheat seedlings. Based on the high similarity between predicted translation products of these three sequences and known members of the HSP70 family from plants, these cDNAs were identified as members of the HSP70 gene family. Two of these members appeared distinct in the 3' non-coding region with only 48% identity. Therefore differential display could successfully be used to isolate 3' regions of different members of a multigene family in a relatively short period, even if the members had highly similar protein-coding regions."

"11269355","abstracttext","A novel approach has been developed to allow for the efficient selection of loss-of-function wheat mutants in the M1 generation, following either physical or chemical mutagenesis. This has generated an order of magnitude increase in the efficiency of identification of mutants, and also greatly increases the likelihood that selected individuals reflect mutation events at the target locus, rather than at genes acting elsewhere in the disease resistance pathway. The approach relies only on prior knowledge of the chromosomal location of the target gene, and uses the polyploidy of wheat to construct populations for mutagenesis in which large numbers of individuals are hemizygous for the target gene. The idea is illustrated with the mass identification of mutants at three independent genes for race-specific resistance to yellow rust, and one gene for resistance to powdery mildew."

Transient and stable expression of the [beta]-glucuronidase reporter gene was used to determine that the heterologous wheat promoter also responds to osmotic stress and ABA in moss. Mutational analysis of the promoter indicated that the mechanism of gene regulation is conserved in both species. Gel retardation and DNase I footprint analyses were conducted to characterize further the interaction of moss transcription factors with the Em promoter. In addition, the synthesis of stress-related polypeptides in moss was observed. The evolutionary significance of these data and the potential for studying the entire ABA perception-response pathway in moss are discussed."

TE 9111 is the most resistant line known in Europe and combines isolate-non-specific, partial resistance with several isolate-specific resistances. We show that, in addition to high levels of partial resistance to STB, TE 9111 has a new gene for resistance to M. graminicola isolate IPO90012, named Stb11, that maps on chromosome 1BS, the Stb6 gene for resistance to isolate IPO323 and, probably, the Stb7 gene for resistance to isolate IPO87019. All of these genes are closely linked to microsatellite markers, which can be used for marker-assisted selection. TE 9111 may therefore be a valuable source of resistance to STB for wheat breeding, especially in Mediterranean environments."

"18449542","abstracttext","Acetolactate synthase (ALS) is a target enzyme for many herbicides, including sulfonylurea and imidazolinone. We investigated the usefulness of a mutated ALS gene of rice, which had double point mutations and encoded an herbicide-resistant form of the enzyme, as a selectable marker for wheat transformation. After the genomic DNA fragment from rice containing the mutated ALS gene was introduced into immature embryos by means of particle bombardment, transgenic plants were efficiently selected with the herbicide bispyribac sodium (BS). Southern blot analysis confirmed that transgenic plants had one to more than ten copies of the transgene in their chromosomes. Adjustment of the BS concentration combined with repeated selection effectively prevented nontransgenic plants from escaping herbicide selection. Measurement of ALS activity indicated that transgenic plants produced an herbicide-resistant form of ALS and therefore had acquired the resistance to BS. This report is the first to describe a selection system for wheat transformation that uses a selectable marker gene of plant origin."

"22891636","abstracttext","The wheat mitochondrial gene for ribosomal protein S7 exhibits multiple transcripts that share the same 3' terminus but range in overall length from 3.4 to 0.7 kb because of 5'end-maturation events.

Steady-state levels of precursor RNAs were seen to be lower in seedlings than in germinating embryos, although the degree of editing within untranslated regions (UTRs) was higher in seedlings. In another grass, Lolium multiflorum Lam., rps7 displays transcripts of 1.3 and 0.7 kb, and although the distal 5' UTRs are unrelated in sequence to those of wheat, the 5' terminus of the longer transcript also maps to a tRNA gene, in this case the native mitochondrial-type tRNA-Ser. Our findings illustrate the plasticity of plant mitochondrial transcriptional units and the recruitment of chloroplast-origin sequences for the expression of mitochondrial genes."

"24169846","abstracttext","Ribosomal RNA genes originating from one parent are often suppressed in interspecific hybrids. We show that treatments during germination with the cytosine analogue 5-azacytidine stably reactivate the expression of the suppressed rRNA genes of rye origin in the wheat x rye amphiploid, triticale, by preventing methylation of sites in the rye rDNA. When 5-azacytidine is applied to embryos of triticale and wheat x rye F1 hybrids nine, or more, days after fertilization, rye rRNA gene expression is stably reactivated in the resulting seedling. Earlier treatments have no effect on rye rRNA gene expression, indicating that undermethylation of DNA early in embryo development is reversible. After 9 days, the methylation status of rRNA genes in maintained throughout development. Since the change in expression follows a methylation change at particular restriction-enzyme sites, the data establish a clear correlation between gene activity and methylation in plants."

On the bases of variation in Est-5 and their Glu-1 and Gli-1 gene loci (in a previous study in this series), only three strangulata accessions showed consistent homology with their prevalent gene expression in the D genome of hexaploid wheat. The implications of these observations for further interpreting the phyletic nature of the D genome donor in natural hexaploid wheat synthesis are also reported."

"28497807","abstracttext","The male-sterile ms2 mutant has been known for 40 years and has become extremely important in the commercial production of wheat. However, the gene responsible for this phenotype has remained unknown. Here we report the map-based cloning of the Ms2 gene. The Ms2 locus is remarkable in several ways that have implications in basic biology. Beyond having no functional annotation, barely detectable transcription in fertile wild-type wheat plants, and accumulated destructive mutations in Ms2 orthologs, the Ms2 allele in the ms2 mutant has acquired a terminal-repeat retrotransposon in miniature (TRIM) element in its promoter. This TRIM element is responsible for the anther-specific Ms2 activation that confers male sterility. The identification of Ms2 not only unravels the genetic basis of a historically important breeding trait, but also shows an example of how a TRIM element insertion near a gene can contribute to genetic novelty and phenotypic plasticity."
"27678518","articletitle","A Natural Mutation Involving both Pathogenicity and Perithecium Formation in the Fusarium graminearum Species Complex."
"27678518","abstracttext","Members of the Fusarium graminearum species complex (Fg complex or FGSC) are the primary pathogens causing Fusarium head blight in wheat and barley worldwide. A natural pathogenicity mutant (strain 0225022) was found in a sample of the Fg complex collected in Japan. The mutant strain did not induce symptoms in wheat spikes beyond the point of inoculation, and did not form perithecia. No segregation of phenotypic deficiencies occurred in the progenies of a cross between the mutant and a fully pathogenic wild-type strain, which suggested that a single genetic locus controlled both traits. The locus was mapped to chromosome 2 by using sequence-tagged markers; and a deletion of ∼3 kb was detected in the mapped region of the mutant strain. The wild-type strain contains the FGSG_02810 gene, encoding a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor protein, in this region. The contribution of FGSG_02810 to pathogenicity and perithecium formation was confirmed by complementation in the mutant strain using gene transfer, and by gene disruption in the wild-type strain."

"30065746","abstracttext","Powdery mildew, caused by the fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici , represents a yield constraint in many parts of the world. Here, the introduction of a resistance gene carried by the cereal rye cv. Qinling chromosome 6R was transferred into wheat in the form of spontaneous balanced translocation induced in plants doubly monosomic for chromosomes 6R and 6A. The translocation, along with other structural variants, was detected using in situ hybridization and genetic markers. The differential disease response of plants harboring various fragments of 6R indicated that a powdery mildew resistance gene(s) was present on both arms of rye chromosome 6R. Based on karyotyping, the short arm gene, designated Pm56 , was mapped to the subtelomere region of the arm. The Robertsonian translocation 6AL⋅6RS can be exploited by wheat breeders as a novel resistance resource."

"32111840","articletitle","Stem rust resistance in wheat is suppressed by a subunit of the mediator complex."
"32111840","abstracttext","Stem rust is an important disease of wheat that can be controlled using resistance genes. The gene SuSr-D1 identified in cultivar 'Canthatch' suppresses stem rust resistance. SuSr-D1 mutants are resistant to several races of stem rust that are virulent on wild-type plants. Here we identify SuSr-D1 by sequencing flow-sorted chromosomes, mutagenesis, and map-based cloning. The gene encodes Med15, a subunit of the Mediator Complex, a conserved protein complex in eukaryotes that regulates expression of protein-coding genes. Nonsense mutations in Med15b.D result in expression of stem rust resistance. Time-course RNAseq analysis show a significant reduction or complete loss of differential gene expression at 24 h post inoculation in med15b.D mutants, suggesting that transcriptional reprogramming at this time point is not required for immunity to stem rust. Suppression is a common phenomenon and this study provides novel insight into suppression of rust resistance in wheat."

"16847566","abstracttext","Belonging to Class II of transposable elements, En/Spm transposons are widespread in a variety of distantly related plant species. Here, we report on the sequence conservation of the transposase region from sequence analyses of En/Spm-like transposons from Poaceae species, namely Zingeria biebersteiniana, Zingeria trichopoda, Triticum monococcum, Triticum urartu, Hordeum spontaneum, and Aegilops speltoides. The transposase region of En/Spm-like transposons was cloned, sequenced, and compared with equivalent regions of Oryza and Arabidopsis from the gene bank database. Southern blot analysis indicated that the En/Spm transposon was present in low (Hordeum spontaneum, Triticum monococcum, Triticum urartu) through medium (Zingeria bieberstiana, Zingeria trichopoda) to relatively high (Aegilops speltoides) copy numbers in Poaceae species. A cytogenetic analysis of the chromosomal distribution of En/Spm transposons revealed the concurence of the chromosomal localization of the En/Spm clusters with mobile clusters of rDNA. An analysis of En/Spm-like transposase amino acid sequences was carried out to investigate sequence divergence between 5 genera--Triticum, Aegilops, Zingeria, Oryza and Arabidopsis. A distance matrix was generated; apparently, En/Spm-like transposase sequences shared the highest sequence homology intra-generically and, as expected, these sequences were significantly diverged from those of O. sativa and A. thaliana. A sequence comparison of En/Spm-like transposase coding regions defined that the intra-genomic complex of En/Spm-like transposons could be viewed as relatively independent, vertically transmitted, and permanently active systems inside higher plant genomes. The sequence data from this article was deposited in the EMBL/GenBank Data Libraries under the accession nos.

"9371885","abstracttext","Triticale, an intergeneric hybrid crop-plant, is generated when female wheat lines are fertilised with pollen from rye. We have investigated the mitochondrial DNA organisation and the expression of a total of 11 different triticale genotypes, varying in their nuclear and cytoplasmic backgrounds. In Southern hybridisations using probes homologous to the upstream flanking sequences, mtDNA fragments characteristic of both wheat and rye mtDNA can be detected in all triticale lines analysed. In addition, clones isolated fom a triticale lambda library exhibit either a maternal-like or paternal-like organisation of the orf25 gene region. By PCR cloning, four different orf25 gene copies were identified in triticale, three of which correspond to maternal (85%) or paternal (12%) orf25 sequences. Three percent of all clones represent a novel type, that might have arisen by homologous recombination. Although these data suggest biparental inheritance of mtDNA in wheat/rye crosses, paternal-like gene copies can also be detected in maternal wheat mitochondria. Their stoichiometry as assayed by competitive PCR is about 0.1% of total orf25 gene copies. The high abundance of paternal-like sequences in the F1 hybrid might therefore be due to either the transmission of rye mtDNA in the intergeneric cross and/or the amplification of sequences in triticale that persist in sub-stoichiometric amounts in wheat. These data suggest that amplification and recombination of sub-genomic mitochondrial molecules are affected by different nuclear genotypes. Interestingly, sequence analysis of triticale RT-PCR clones indicates a selective transcription of maternal-like orf25 gene copies in triticale. Mitochondrial gene expression may therefore possess mechanisms to compensate for the variation of mtDNA organisation."

"15258740","abstracttext","Aegilops tauschii (goat grass) is the progenitor of the D genome in hexaploid bread wheat. We have screened more than 200 Ae. tauschii accessions for resistance against leaf rust (Puccinia triticina) isolates,which are avirulent on the leaf rust resistance gene Lrl. Approximately 3.5% of the Ae. tauschii accessions displayed the same low infection type as the tester line Thatcher Lrl. The accession Tr.t. 213, which showed resistance after artificial infection with Lrl isolates both in Mexico and in Switzerland, was chosen for further analysis. Genetic analysis showed that the resistance in this accession is controlled by a single dominant gene,which mapped at the same chromosomal position as Lrl in wheat. It was delimited in a 1.3-cM region between the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers ABC718 and PSR567 on chromosome 5DL of Ae.tauschii. The gene was more tightly linked to PSR567(0.47 cM) than to ABC718 (0.79 cM). These results indicate that the resistance gene in Ae. tauschii accession Tr.t. 213 is an ortholog of the leaf rust resistance gene Lrlof bread wheat, suggesting that Lrl originally evolved in diploid goat grass and was introgressed into the wheat D genome during or after domestication of hexaploidwheat. Compared to hexaploid wheat, higher marker polymorphism and recombination frequencies were ob-served in the region of the Lrl ortholog in Ae. tauschii. The identification of LrlAe, the orthologous gene of wheatLrl, in Ae. tauschii will allow map-based cloning of Lrlfrom this genetically simpler, diploid genome."

"19656041","abstracttext","The toxin sensitivity gene Tsn1 interacts with Ptr ToxA (ToxA), a host-selective toxin produced by the necrotrophic fungus Pyrenophora tritici-repentis. The molecular mechanisms associated with cell death in sensitive wheat cultivars following ToxA application are not well understood. To address this question, we used the Affymetrix GeneChip Wheat Genome Array to compare gene expression in a sensitive wheat cultivar possessing the Tsn1 gene with the insensitive wheat cv. Nec103, which lacks the Tsn1 gene. This analysis was performed at early timepoints after infiltration with ToxA (e.g., 0.5 to 12 h postinfiltration [hpi]); at this time, ToxA is known to internalize into mesophyll cells without visible cell death symptoms. Gene expression also was monitored at later timepoints (24 to 48 hpi), when ToxA causes extensive damage in cellular compartments and visible cell death. At both early and late timepoints, numerous defense-related genes were induced (2- to 197-fold increases) and included genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway, lignification, and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, a subset of host genes functioning in signal transduction, metabolism, and as transcription factors was induced as a consequence of the Tsn1-ToxA interaction. Nine genes known to be involved in the host defense response and signaling pathways were selected for analysis by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the expression profiles of these genes confirmed the results obtained in microarray experiments. Histochemical analyses of a sensitive wheat cultivar showed that H(2)O(2) was present in leaves undergoing cell death, indicating that ROS signaling is a major event involved in ToxA-mediated cell death. The results suggest that recognition of ToxA via Tsn1 triggers transcriptional reprogramming events similar to those reported for avirulence-resistance gene interactions, and that host-derived genes play an important role in the modulation of susceptibility to P. tritici-repentis."
"21175887","articletitle","Two putatively homoeologous wheat genes mediate recognition of SnTox3 to confer effector-triggered susceptibility to Stagonospora nodorum."
"21175887","abstracttext","The pathogen Stagonospora nodorum produces multiple effectors, also known as host-selective toxins (HSTs), that interact with corresponding host sensitivity genes in an inverse gene-for-gene manner to cause the disease Stagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB) in wheat. In this study, a sensitivity gene was identified in Aegilops tauschii, the diploid D-genome donor of common wheat. The gene was mapped to the short arm of chromosome 5D and mediated recognition of the effector SnTox3, which was previously shown to be recognized by the wheat gene Snn3 on chromosome arm 5BS. Comparative mapping suggested that Snn3 and the gene on 5DS are probably homoeologous and derived from a common ancestor. Therefore, we propose to designate these genes as Snn3-B1 and Snn3-D1, respectively. Compatible Snn3-D1-SnTox3 interactions resulted in more severe necrosis in both effector infiltration and spore inoculation experiments than compatible Snn3-B1-SnTox3 interactions, indicating that Snn3-B1 and Snn3-D1 may have different affinities in SnTox3 recognition or signal transduction. Wheat bin-mapped expressed sequence tags and good levels of collinearity among the wheat Snn3 regions, rice (Oryza sativa), and Brachypodium distachyon were exploited for saturation and fine mapping of the Snn3-D1 locus. Markers delineating the Snn3-D1 locus to a 1.4 cM interval will be useful for initiating positional cloning. Further characterization of how these homoeologous genes mediate recognition of the same pathogen effector should enhance understanding of host manipulation by necrotrophic pathogens in causing disease."

"22580967","abstracttext","Stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, is a devastating disease of wheat. The emergence of race TTKSK (Ug99) and new variants in Africa threatens wheat production worldwide. The best method of controlling stem rust is to deploy effective resistance genes in wheat cultivars. Few stem rust resistance (Sr) genes derived from the primary gene pool of wheat confer resistance to TTKSK. Norin 40, which carries Sr42, is resistant to TTKSK and variants TTKST and TTTSK. The goal of this study was to elucidate the inheritance of resistance to Ug99 in Norin 40 and map the Sr gene(s). A doubled haploid (DH) population of LMPG-6/Norin 40 was evaluated for resistance to the race TTKST. Segregation of 248 DH lines fitted a 1:1 ratio (χ (2) 1:1= 0.58, p = 0.45), indicating a single gene in Norin 40 conditioned resistance to Ug99. This was confirmed by an independent F(2:3) population also derived from the cross LMPG-6/Norin 40 where a 1:2:1 ratio (χ (2)1:2:1 = 0.69, p = 0.71) was observed following the inoculation with race TTKSK. Mapping with DNA markers located this gene to chromosome 6DS, the known location of Sr42. PCR marker FSD_RSA co-segregated with Sr42, and simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker BARC183 was closely linked (0.5 cM) to Sr42. A previous study found close linkage between FSD_RSA and SrCad, a temporarily designated gene that also confers resistance to Ug99, thus Sr42 may be the same gene or allelic. Marker FSD_RSA is suitable for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in wheat breeding programs to improve stem rust resistance, including Ug99."

"26353816","abstracttext_results","We find that 27 % of the 3B predicted genes are non-syntenic with the orthologous chromosomes of Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa, and Sorghum bicolor, whereas, by applying the same criteria, non-syntenic genes represent on average only 10 % of the predicted genes in these three model grasses. These non-syntenic genes on 3B have high sequence similarity to at least one other gene in the wheat genome, indicating that hexaploid wheat has undergone massive small-scale interchromosomal gene duplications compared to other grasses. Insertions of non-syntenic genes occurred at a similar rate along the chromosome, but these genes tend to be retained at a higher frequency in the distal, recombinogenic regions. The ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates showed a more relaxed selection pressure for non-syntenic genes compared to syntenic genes, and gene ontology analysis indicated that non-syntenic genes may be enriched in functions involved in disease resistance."

"27862820","abstracttext","Genotype specificity is a big problem lagging the development of efficient hexaploid wheat transformation system. Increasingly, the biosecurity of genetically modified organisms is garnering public attention, so the generation of marker-free transgenic plants is very important to the eventual potential commercial release of transgenic wheat. In this study, 15 commercial Chinese hexaploid wheat varieties were successfully transformed via an Agrobacterium-mediated method, with efficiency of up to 37.7%, as confirmed by the use of Quickstix strips, histochemical staining, PCR analysis and Southern blotting. Of particular interest, marker-free transgenic wheat plants from various commercial Chinese varieties and their F 1 hybrids were successfully obtained for the first time, with a frequency of 4.3%, using a plasmid harbouring two independent T-DNA regions. The average co-integration frequency of the gus and the bar genes located on the two independent T-DNA regions was 49.0% in T 0 plants. We further found that the efficiency of generating marker-free plants was related to the number of bar gene copies integrated in the genome. Marker-free transgenic wheat plants were identified in the progeny of three transgenic lines that had only one or two bar gene copies. Moreover, silencing of the bar gene was detected in 30.7% of T 1 positive plants, but the gus gene was never found to be silenced in T 1 plants. Bisulphite genomic sequencing suggested that DNA methylation in the 35S promoter of the bar gene regulatory region might be the main reason for bar gene silencing in the transgenic plants."

"28356604","abstracttext","Zymoseptoria tritici , the causal agent of septoria tritici blotch, a serious foliar disease of wheat, is a necrotrophic pathogen that undergoes a long latent period. Emergence of insensitivity to fungicides, and pesticide reduction policies, mean there is a pressing need to understand septoria and control it through greater varietal resistance. Stb6 and Stb15 , the most common qualitative resistance genes in modern wheat cultivars, determine specific resistance to avirulent fungal genotypes following a gene-for-gene relationship. This study investigated compatible and incompatible interactions of wheat with Z. tritici using eight combinations of cultivars and isolates, with the aim of identifying molecular responses that could be used as markers for disease resistance during the early, symptomless phase of colonization. The accumulation of TaMPK3 was estimated using western blotting, and the expression of genes implicated in gene-for-gene interactions of plants with a wide range of other pathogens was measured by qRT-PCR during the presymptomatic stages of infection. Production of TaMPK3 and expression of most of the genes responded to inoculation with Z. tritici but varied considerably between experimental replicates. However, there was no significant difference between compatible and incompatible interactions in any of the responses tested. These results demonstrate that the molecular biology of the gene-for-gene interaction between wheat and Zymoseptoria is unlike that in many other plant diseases, indicate that environmental conditions may strongly influence early responses of wheat to infection by Z. tritici , and emphasize the importance of including both compatible and incompatible interactions when investigating the biology of this complex pathosystem."

"22562146","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat worldwide. Resistance is the best approach to control the disease. High-temperature adult-plant (HTAP) stripe rust resistance has proven to be race non-specific and durable. However, genes conferring high-levels of HTAP resistance are limited in number and new genes are urgently needed for breeding programs to develop cultivars with durable high-level resistance to stripe rust. Spring wheat germplasm PI 183527 showed a high-level of HTAP resistance against stripe rust in our germplasm evaluations over several years. To elucidate the genetic basis of resistance, we crossed PI 183527 and susceptible wheat line Avocet S. Adult plants of parents, F(1), F(2) and F(2:3) progeny were tested with selected races under the controlled greenhouse conditions and in fields under natural infection. PI 183527 has a single dominant gene conferring HTAP resistance. Resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers in combination with bulked segregant analysis (BSA) were used to identify markers linked to the resistance gene. A linkage map consisting of 4 RGAP and 7 SSR markers was constructed for the resistance gene using data from 175 F(2) plants and their derived F(2:3) lines. Amplification of nulli-tetrasomic, ditelosomic and deletion lines of Chinese Spring with three RGAP markers mapped the gene to the distal region (0.86-1.0) of chromosome 7BL. The molecular map spanned a genetic distance of 27.3 cM, and the resistance gene was narrowed to a 2.3-cM interval flanked by markers Xbarc182 and Xwgp5258. The polymorphism rates of the flanking markers in 74 wheat lines were 74 and 30 %, respectively; and the two markers in combination could distinguish the alleles at the resistance locus in 82 % of tested genotypes. To determine the genetic relationship between this resistance gene and Yr39, a gene also on 7BL conferring HTAP resistance in Alpowa, a cross was made between PI 183527 and Alpowa. F(2) segregation indicated that the genes were 36.5 ± 6.75 cM apart. The gene in PI 183527 was therefore designed as Yr52. This new gene and flanking markers should be useful in developing wheat cultivars with high-level and possible durable resistance to stripe rust."

"17177061","abstracttext","Dynamic management (DM) is a method of genetic resources conservation that aims at maintaining evolutionary process in subdivided populations cultivated in contrasted environments. Such populations are often submitted to strong natural selection as it was the case for experimental wheat populations maintained under DM. Understanding impacts of selection on genetic diversity around selected genes is necessary for the middle-term maintenance of genetic variability in DM populations. Evolution of diversity at six neutral markers located near the yellow rust resistance gene Yr17 has been studied for the parental lines and for generations 1, 5, 10 and 17 in one of the DM populations. Yr17 provided complete resistance to yellow rust in France until 1997 and thus was suspected to be under strong selection. The gene is located on a fragment introgressed in winter wheat from a wild species. The presence of the gene was estimated using a marker closely related to the gene. We showed that the Yr17 gene has been selected between generations 5 and 10. Generally, selection tends to reduce diversity around selected genes, generating linkage disequilibrium (LD) between a gene and adjacent markers. Here, the major effect of the Yr17 gene selection was a reduction of multilocus diversity and the maintenance of strong pre-existing LD in the zone surrounding the gene for a distance of 20 cM. As expected, the presence of the exogenous introgression was responsible for restrictions to recombination which contributed to the maintenance of strong correlations between loci. However, we found a noticeable number of recombinations around the gene indicating a progressive incorporation of the fragment into the wheat genome."

"17063338","abstracttext","Among cereal crops, rye is one of the most tolerant species to aluminum. A candidate gene approach was used to determine the likely molecular identity of an Al tolerance locus (Alt4). Using PCR primers designed from a wheat aluminum tolerance gene encoding an aluminum-activated malate transporter (TaALMT1), a rye gene (ScALMT1) was amplified, cloned and sequenced. Subsequently, the ScALMT1 gene of rye was found to be located on 7RS by PCR amplification using the wheat-rye addition lines. SNP polymorphisms for this gene were detected among the parents of three F(2) populations that segregate for the Alt4 locus. A map of the rye chromosome 7R, including the Alt4 locus ScALMT1 and several molecular markers, was constructed showing a complete co-segregation between Alt4 and ScALMT1. Furthermore, expression experiments were carried out to clarify the function of this candidate gene. Briefly, the ScALMT1 gene was found to be primarily expressed in the root apex and upregulated when aluminum was present in the medium. Five-fold differences in the expression were found between the Al tolerant and the Al non-tolerant genotypes. Additionally, much higher expression was detected in the rye genotypes than the moderately tolerant ""Chinese Spring"" wheat cultivar. These results suggest that the Alt4 locus encodes an aluminum-activated organic acid transporter gene that could be utilized to increase Al tolerance in Al sensitive plant species. Finally, TaALMT1 homologous sequences were identified in different grasses and in the dicotyledonous plant Phaseolus vulgaris. Our data support the hypothesis of the existence of a common mechanism of Al tolerance encoded by a gene located in the homoeologous group four of cereals."

A detailed analysis revealed that more than 5% of the 1RS sequence consisted of gene space, identifying at least 3,121 gene loci representing 1,882 different gene functions. Repetitive elements comprised about 72% of the 1RS sequence, Gypsy/Sabrina (13.3%) being the most abundant. More than four thousand simple sequence repeat (SSR) sites mostly located in gene related sequence reads were identified for possible marker development. The existence of chloroplast insertions in 1RS has been verified by identifying chimeric chloroplast-genomic sequence reads. Synteny analysis of 1RS to the full genomes of Oryza sativa and Brachypodium distachyon revealed that about half of the genes of 1RS correspond to the distal end of the short arm of rice chromosome 5 and the proximal region of the long arm of Brachypodium distachyon chromosome 2. Comparison of the gene content of 1RS to 1HS barley chromosome arm revealed high conservation of genes related to chromosome 5 of rice."

"19166492","abstracttext","Differential gene expression between hybrids and their parents is considered to be associated with heterosis. However, the physiological functions and possible contribution to heterosis of these differentially expressed genes are unknown. We have isolated one hybrid upregulated gene encoding putative wheat ADP-ribosylation factor, designated TaARF. In this study, real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that the TaARF transcript was preferentially expressed in root, node and crown, and the accumulation of TaARF mRNA in hybrid was more than 1.5-fold higher than that in two parents. In order to understand possible roles of the putative wheat ARF gene, TaARF was overexpressed in Arabidopsis, and the transgenic plants were characterized. We show that ectopic overexpression of TaARF in Arabidopsis leads to increased leaf area, increased growth rate and earlier transition to flowering, suggesting that TaARF plays significant roles in growth and development. This study provides evidence demonstrating that TaARF plays important roles in growth and development and we speculate that the upregulated expression of this gene might contribute to the heterosis observed in wheat root and leaf growth."

"2279356","abstracttext","A majority of histone genes are expressed in the S phase during the cell cycle. Using the gene expression system of transformed sunflower cells into which wheat histone H3 gene was introduced by the Ti-plasmid gene transfer technique, we determined three cis-acting control sequences (hexameric, octameric, and nonameric motifs) which seemed to confer the S-phase-specific transcription of wheat histone genes. Furthermore, as candidates for regulatory transcription factors, three nuclear DNA-binding proteins HBP-1a, HBP-1b, and HBP-2 that interact with the hexameric and nonameric motifs were identified. The structural analysis of the cDNA of HBP-1a revealed that a nuclear protein has the leucine-zipper structure and a DNA-binding motif. The hexameric motif in the H3 gene was also seen in cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV 35S) promoter and shown to function as a regulatory element of this promoter. The wheat HBP-1b can interact with the hexameric motif of the CaMV 35S promoter. Much attention has been paid to the significance of the hexameric sequences within the H3 and CaMV 35S promoters and the DNA-binding proteins HBP-1a and HBP-1b."

"8152910","abstracttext","We examined the 3'-flanking regions required for accurate 3'-end formation of wheat histone H3 mRNA using gene expression in transformed sunflower cells. The introduction of mutations into the conserved sequence AATGGAAATG in the 3'-flanking region of plant histone genes, located 22 bp upstream from the polyadenylation site of the wheat H3 gene (TH012), completely abolished the 3'-end formation of mRNA at the authentic 3' end without affecting the transcription efficiency. However, a 0.8 kbp sequence containing this motif could not produce a normal 3' end when joined to the 3' end of the nopaline synthase (NOS) gene instead of its 3' sequence. The results indicated that this conserved sequence is necessary but not sufficient for the 3'-end formation of H3 or NOS mRNA. Deletion of a 59 bp sequence, located 19 bp upstream from the AATGGAAATG sequence, also reduced the 3'-end formation efficiency by a factor of 10, compared with the efficiency in wild-type gene. We concluded that 3'-end formation of wheat histone H3 mRNA is regulated by multiple sequences including the AATGGAAATG motif."

Hard Red Winter Tam 107) acetyl-CoA carboxylase [ACCase; acetyl-CoA:carbon-dioxide ligase (ADP-forming), EC 6.4.1.2] has been cloned and sequenced. Comparison of the 12-kb genomic sequence with the 7.4-kb cDNA sequence reported previously revealed 29 introns. Within the coding region, the exon sequence is 98% identical to the known wheat cDNA sequence. A second ACCase gene was identified by sequencing fragments of genomic clones that include the first two exons and the first intron. Additional transcripts were detected by 5' and 3' RACE analysis (rapid amplification of cDNA ends). One set of transcripts had a 5' end sequence identical to the cDNA found previously and another set was identical to the gene reported here. The 3' RACE clones fall into four distinguishable sequence sets, bringing the number of ACCase sequences to six. None of these cDNA or genomic clones encodes a chloroplast targeting signal. Identification of six different sequences suggests that either the cytosolic ACCase genes are duplicated in the three chromosome sets in hexaploid wheat or that each of the six alleles of the cytosolic ACCase gene has a readily distinguishable DNA sequence."

"11430425","abstracttext","A cDNA clone of a wheat germin-like oxalate oxidase (OxO) gene regulated by the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter was expressed in a hybrid poplar clone, Populus x euramericana ('Ogy'). Previous studies showed that OxO is likely to play an important role in several aspects of plant development, stress response, and defense against pathogens. In order to study this wheat oxalate oxidase gene in woody plants, the expression of this gene and the functions of the encoded enzyme were examined in vitro and in vivo in transgenic 'Ogy'. The enzyme activity in the transformed 'Ogy' was visualized by histochemical assays and in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. It was found that the wheat OxO gene is expressed in leaves, stems, and roots of the transgenic 'Ogy' plants and the encoded enzyme is able to break down oxalic acid. Transgenic 'Ogy' leaves were more tolerant to oxalic acid as well as more effective in increasing the pH in an oxalic acid solution when compared to untransformed controls. In addition, when leaf disks from 'Ogy' plants were inoculated with conidia of the poplar pathogenic fungus Septoria musiva, which produces oxalic acid, the OxO-transformed plants were more resistant than the untransformed controls."

"10996244","abstracttext","We isolated three kinds of full-length cDNA clones for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) from wheat. They showed over 80% sequence homology with potato and alfalfa at the amino acid level, suggesting that the genes are highly conserved in angiosperms. The lack of a plastidic signal sequence, as well as a higher transcript accumulation level in roots than leaves, suggested that the wheat cDNA sequences encode the cytosolic isoform of the enzyme. Genomic Southern analysis revealed that the isoform is encoded by a few copies of the gene in the wheat genome. Southern analysis of nullisomic-tetrasomic lines suggested that at least one gene is located on chromosome 2B. The G6PDH transcript started to accumulate in the roots after 2 h of 0.15 M NaCl treatment, reaching its maximal level after 12 h of exposure. The G6PDH gene did not respond to either mannitol or abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. The NaCl-specific early response of the G6PDH gene is discussed in relation to the putative role of the enzyme in the salt stress response in plants."

"12882394","abstracttext","Weanling rats were fed respective diets diverse in protein source and content for a full week, and hepatic serine dehydratase (SDH) was examined for its gene expression and activity induction attendant on high protein intake. The protein sources used were three kinds of milk casein, codfish meat, and wheat gluten. The body weight gain (% augmentation/wk) increased with increasing protein intake and reached a plateau in both milk casein- and codfish meat-fed rats by protein intake above 2.5 g/100 g BW/d; however, the body weight gain continued to increase albeit at a slower rate in wheat gluten-fed rats. Quite similar tendencies were also seen in nitrogen balance. The ascent of SDH activity induction and its causal gene expression were characterized as codfish meat>milk casein>>wheat gluten in order of response to protein intake near or more than 4 g/100 g BW/d. The difference in SDH gene expression among these dietary proteins was substantiated by a confirmation experiment in which six rats of each group were fed 25% or 50% protein diets under the same conditions as above. Hence, the quantity as well as quality of dietary protein turned out to have an influence on SDH gene expression."

"14734803","abstracttext","Cis-acting regulatory elements of the wheat acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) gene family were identified by comparing the promoter activity of 5' end gene fragments fused to a reporter gene in two transient expression systems: wheat protoplasts and epidermal cells of mature embryos. Expression of the plastid and the cytosolic ACC genes is each driven by two nested promoters responsible for the synthesis of two transcript types. The internal promoter is located in an intron removed from transcripts originating at the first promoter. These complex promoters, which are different for the cytosolic and plastid ACC genes, control tissue-specific expression of the enzymatic activity supplying cytosolic, plastid, and mitochondrial pools of malonyl-CoA. The activity of one such complex promoter, driving expression of one of the cytosolic ACC genes, was studied throughout development of transgenic wheat plants carrying a full-length promoter-reporter gene fusion. High activity of the promoter was detected in the coleoptile, in the upper sheath section of the leaf, on the top surface of the ovary, in some sections of the main veins in the lemma and glume, and in abaxial epidermis hair cells of the lemma, glume, and rachis. The findings are consistent with the developmental and environmental requirements for very-long-chain fatty acids and flavonoids, whose synthesis begins with the ACC reaction in the cytosol of these specific cell types."

"16479535","abstracttext","Wheat leaf rust is caused by the fungus Puccinia triticina. The genetics of resistance follows the gene-for-gene hypothesis, and thus the presence or absence of a single host resistance gene renders a plant resistant or susceptible to a leaf rust race bearing the corresponding avirulence gene. To investigate some of the changes in the proteomes of both host and pathogen during disease development, a susceptible line of wheat infected with a virulent race of leaf rust were compared to mock-inoculated wheat using 2-DE (with IEF pH 4-8) and MS. Up-regulated protein spots were excised and analyzed by MALDI-QqTOF MS/MS, followed by cross-species protein identification. Where possible MS/MS spectra were matched to homologous proteins in the NCBI database or to fungal ESTs encoding putative proteins. Searching was done using the MASCOT search engine. Remaining unmatched spectra were then sequenced de novo and queried against the NCBInr database using the BLAST and MS BLAST tools. A total of 32 consistently up-regulated proteins were examined from the gels representing the 9-day post-infection proteome in susceptible plants. Of these 7 are host proteins, 22 are fungal proteins of known or hypothetical function and 3 are unknown proteins of putative fungal origin."

More than 70 resistant transgenic plants were obtained. Genomic PCR and RNA dot blotting analyses showed that DREB gene had been integrated into wheat genome of the transgenic plants (T0 and T1) and was well expressed in offspring seed of different transgenic lines. The content of proline in leaves and seeds of T2 transgenic lines was analyzed. Among 16 tested transgenic lines, 10 transgenic lines exhibited more than two fold of proline level in leaves as compared with CK plants. Under drought condition, after stopping water for 15 days the leaves of transgenic lines were still green, while CK were faded. After rewatering for 10 days, the leaves of transgenic lines maintained their green, while all CK plants were dead. Our research suggested that introducing a novel DREB transcriptional factor into wheat is an effective way to improve its drought-tolerance ability."

"16523349","abstracttext","Temperature and light significantly influence chloroplast development and chlorophyll biosynthesis. To understand the mechanism of the modulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis, the levels of transcripts and proteins of many enzymatic steps of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in wheat and cucumber were simultaneously examined. The effect of low (chill-stress) as well as high (heat-stress) temperatures on dark- and light-grown seedlings was monitored. The protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) content was greatly reduced in response to light in control and heat-stressed seedlings. However, the POR level was not reduced in light-exposed chill-stressed seedlings. The genes for glutamate semialdehyde aminotransferase (gsa; cucumber), glutamyl-tRNA reductase (GluTR; cucumber), 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (Ala D; cucumber and wheat) and for a subunit of Mg-chelatase (Chl I; wheat) showed a reduced expression in cold stress compared to controls and heat-stress conditions. Although expression of the ferrochelatase gene (Fch) and geranylgeranyl reductase gene (Chl P) was upregulated in light, they were downregulated by both chill- and heat-stress. Interestingly, gsa and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase gene (UroD) and gene product abundance was stimulated by light and heat-stress implying the presence of both light and heat-inducible elements in their promoters. This observation corroborates with the previous report of increased enzymatic activity of UroD in heat-stressed cucumber seedlings. The gsa and Uro D may play an important role in tolerance of the greening process of plants to heat-stress."

"17216491","abstracttext","Plant pathogenic fungi of the genus Fusarium can cause severe diseases on small grain cereals and maize. The contamination of harvested grain with Fusarium mycotoxins is a threat to human and animal health. In wheat production of the toxin deoxynivalenol (DON), which inhibits eukaryotic protein biosynthesis, is a virulence factor of Fusarium, and resistance against DON is considered to be part of Fusarium resistance. Previously, single amino acid changes in RPL3 (ribosomal protein L3) conferring DON resistance have been described in yeast. The goal of this work was to characterize the RPL3 gene family from wheat and to investigate the potential role of naturally existing RPL3 alleles in DON resistance by comparing Fusarium-resistant and susceptible cultivars. The gene family consists of three homoeologous alleles of both RPL3A and RPL3B, which are located on chromosomes 4A (RPL3-B2), 4B (RPL3-B1), 4D (RPL3-B3), 5A (RPL3-A3), 5B (RPL3-A2) and 5D (RPL3-A1). Alternative splicing was detected in the TaRPL3-A2 gene. Sequence comparison revealed no amino acid differences between cultivars differing in Fusarium resistance. While using developed SNP markers we nevertheless found that one of the genes, namely, TaRPL3-A3 mapped close to a Fusarium resistance QTL (Qfhs.ifa-5A). The potential role of the RPL3 gene family in DON resistance of wheat is discussed."

"19941967","abstracttext","Natural resistance of wheat against Fusarium head blight (FHB) is inadequate and new strategies for controlling the disease are required. Chitin synthases that catalyze chitin biosynthesis would be an ideal target for antifungal agents. In this study, a class I chitin synthase gene (CHS1) from Fusarium asiaticum, the predominant species of FHB pathogens on wheat in China, was functionally disrupted via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Specific disruption of the CHS1 gene resulted in a 58% reduction of chitin synthase activity, accompanied by decreases of 35% in chitin content, 22% in conidiation, and 16% in macroconidium length. The Deltachs1 mutant strain had a growth rate comparable to that of the wild-type on PDA medium but had a 35% increase in the number of nuclear cellulae and exhibited a remarkably increased sensitivity to osmosis stresses. Electron microscopy revealed substantial changes occurring in cell wall structures of the macroconidium, ascospore, and mycelium, with the most profound changes in the mycelium. Furthermore, the Deltachs1 mutant displayed significantly reduced pathogenicity on wheat spikes and seedlings. Re-introduction of a functional CHS1 gene into the Deltachs1 mutant strain restored the wild-type phenotype. These results reveal an important in vivo role played by a CHS1 gene in a FHB pathogen whose mycelial chitin could serve as a target for controlling the disease."

"19806176","abstracttext","The necrotrophic fungus Stagonospora nodorum produces multiple proteinaceous host-selective toxins (HSTs) which act in effector triggered susceptibility. Here, we report the molecular cloning and functional characterization of the SnTox3-encoding gene, designated SnTox3, as well as the initial characterization of the SnTox3 protein. SnTox3 is a 693 bp intron-free gene with little obvious homology to other known genes. The predicted immature SnTox3 protein is 25.8 kDa in size. A 20 amino acid signal sequence as well as a possible pro sequence are predicted. Six cysteine residues are predicted to form disulfide bonds and are shown to be important for SnTox3 activity. Using heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris and transformation into an avirulent S. nodorum isolate, we show that SnTox3 encodes the SnTox3 protein and that SnTox3 interacts with the wheat susceptibility gene Snn3. In addition, the avirulent S. nodorum isolate transformed with SnTox3 was virulent on host lines expressing the Snn3 gene. SnTox3-disrupted mutants were deficient in the production of SnTox3 and avirulent on the Snn3 differential wheat line BG220. An analysis of genetic diversity revealed that SnTox3 is present in 60.1% of a worldwide collection of 923 isolates and occurs as eleven nucleotide haplotypes resulting in four amino acid haplotypes. The cloning of SnTox3 provides a fundamental tool for the investigation of the S. nodorum-wheat interaction, as well as vital information for the general characterization of necrotroph-plant interactions."

"21208308","abstracttext","The race-specific barley powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei) resistance gene Mla occurs as an allelic series and encodes CC-NB-LRR type resistance proteins. Inter-generic allele mining resulted in the isolation and characterisation of an Mla homologue from diploid wheat, designated TmMla1, which shares 78% identity with barley HvMLA1 at the protein level. TmMla1 was found to be a functional resistance gene against Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici in wheat, hereby providing an example of R gene orthologs controlling the same disease in two different species. TmMLA1 exhibits race-specific resistance activity and its N-terminal coiled-coil domain interacts with the barley transcription factor HvWRKY1. Interestingly, TmMLA1 was not functional in barley transient assays. Replacement of the TmMLA1 LRR domain with that of HvMLA1 revealed that this fusion protein conferred resistance against B. graminis f. sp. hordei isolate K1 in barley. Thus, TmMLA1 not only confers resistance in wheat but possibly also in barley against an as yet unknown barley powdery mildew race. The conservation of functional R gene orthologs over at least 12 million years is surprising given the observed rapid breakdown of Mla-based resistance against barley mildew in agricultural ecosystems. This suggests a high stability of Mla resistance in the natural environment before domestication."

"24128392","abstracttext","microRNA (miRNA) participates in various physiological and biochemical processes in plants by regulating corresponding target genes. NAC [NAM (no apical meristem), ATAF (Arabidopsis transcription activation factor) and CUC (cup-shaped cotyledon)] transcription factors, usually as the targets of miR164, play important roles in the regulation of plant development and responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. In a previous study, the target gene of tae-miR164 in wheat was sequenced through degradome sequencing. In this study, we isolated the full-length cDNA of the candidate target gene, which is a NAC transcription factor gene in the NAM subfamily, and designated it as TaNAC21/22 after bioinformatics analysis. The interaction between TaNAC21/22 and tae-miR164 was confirmed experimentally through co-transformation of both genes in tobacco leaves. Transcript accumulation of TaNAC21/22 and tae-miR164 showed contrasting divergent expression patterns in wheat response to Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). TaNAC21/22 was confirmed to be located in the nucleus and could function as a transcriptional activator. Silencing of the individual gene showed that TaNAC21/22 negatively regulates resistance to stripe rust. These results indicate that the target of tae-miR164, a novel NAC transcription factor from the NAM subfamily of wheat, plays an important role in regulating the resistance of host plants to stripe rust."

Race TTKSK (Ug99) of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, the causal fungus of stem rust, threatens global wheat production because of its broad virulence to current wheat cultivars. A recently identified Ug99 resistance gene from cultivar Webster, temporarily designated as SrWeb, mapped near the stem rust resistance gene locus Sr9. We determined that SrWeb is also present in Ug99 resistant cultivar Gabo 56 by comparative mapping and an allelism test. Analysis of resistance in a population segregating for both Sr9e and SrWeb demonstrated that SrWeb is an allele at the Sr9 locus, which subsequently was designated as Sr9h. Webster and Gabo 56 were susceptible to the Ug99-related race TTKSF+ from South Africa. Race TTKSF+ possesses unique virulence to uncharacterized Ug99 resistance in cultivar Matlabas. This result validated that resistance to Ug99 in Webster and Gabo 56 is conferred by the same gene: Sr9h. The emergence of pathogen virulence to several resistance genes that are effective to the original Ug99 race TTKSK, including Sr9h, suggests that resistance genes should be used in combinations in order to increase resistance durability."

In order to understand the physiological responses in plants that are mediated by the SbPIP1 gene, SbPIP1-overexpressing wheat lines and WT plants of the wheat cv. Ningmai 13 were treated with salt stress. Several physiological parameters, such as the proline content, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and the content of soluble sugars and proteins, were compared between SbPIP1-transformed lines and WT plants under normal growth or salt stress conditions. The results indicate that overexpression of the SbPIP1 gene can increase the accumulation of the osmolyte proline, decrease the MDA content, and enhance the soluble sugar biosynthesis in the early period but has no influence on the regulation of soluble protein biosynthesis in wheat. The results suggest that SbPIP1 contributes to salt tolerance by facilitating the accumulation of the osmolyte proline, increasing the antioxidant response, and increasing the biosynthesis of soluble sugar in the early period. These results indicate SbPIP1 plays an important role in the salt stress response. Overexpression of SbPIP1 might be used to improve the salt tolerance of important crop plants."

"29581960","abstracttext","Inflorescence represents the highly specialized plant tissue producing the grains. Although key genes regulating flower initiation and development are conserved, the mechanism regulating fertility is still not well explained. To identify genes and gene network underlying inflorescence morphology and fertility of bread wheat, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from different tissues were analyzed using a comparative transcriptomics approach. Based on statistical comparison of EST frequencies of individual genes in EST pools representing different tissues and verification with RT-PCR and RNA-seq data, 170 genes of 59 gene sets predominantly expressed in the inflorescence were obtained. Nearly one-third of the gene sets displayed differentiated expression profiles in terms of their subgenome orthologs. The identified genes, most of which were predominantly expressed in anthers, encode proteins involved in wheat floral identity determination, anther and pollen development, pollen-pistil interaction, and others. Particularly, 25 annotated gene sets are associated with pollen wall formation, of which 18 encode enzymes or proteins participating in lipid metabolic pathway, including fatty acid ω -hydroxylation, alkane and fatty alcohol biosynthesis, and glycerophospholipid metabolism. We showed that the comparative transcriptomics approach was effective in identifying genes for reproductive development and found that lipid metabolism was particularly active in wheat anthers."

F 2 families from Tc*2/AC Domain and AC Taber/Tc*2 were tested with isolates of P. recondita f. sp. tritici as seedlings in the greenhouse and as adults in the field rust nursery. Segregation of BC 1 F 2 families indicated that AC Domain had seedling resistance genes Lr10 and Lr16, and the adult plant gene Lr34. AC Domain was also hypothesized to have the adult plant gene Lr12 based on infection types with P. recondita f. sp. tritici isolates that differed for virulence to Lr12. The effective field leaf rust resistance of AC Domain was conditioned by Lr16 and Lr34. Segregation of BC 1 F 2 families and infection types of BC 1 F 3 -derived BC 1 F 4 plants indicated that AC Taber had Lr14a for seedling resistance, the adult plant gene Lr13, plus an additional uncharacterized adult plant resistance gene currently designated as LrTb."

Genetic analysis of the F 2 populations and their derived F 2:3 families of crosses of Dahongtou with the susceptible varieties Mingxian 169 and Huixianhong indicated that the resistance of Dahongtou to B. graminis f. sp. tritici isolate E09 was conferred by a single recessive gene, tentatively designated as pmDHT . The gene was mapped to chromosome arm 7BL and flanked by markers Xwmc526/XBE443877 and Xgwm611/Xwmc511 at genetic distances of 0.8 and 0.3 cM, respectively. The chromosomal position of pmDHT was similar to the multi-allelic Pm5 locus on 7BL. Allelism tests with crosses of Dahongtou with Fuzhuang 30 ( Pm5e ) and Xiaobaidong ( mlxbd ) indicated that pmDHT was allelic to both Pm5e and mlxbd . However, pmDHT showed a different pattern of resistance to the 38 B. graminis f. sp. tritici isolates compared with wheat lines with Pm5a , Pm5b , Pm5e , mlxbd , and PmHYM and also differed from PmSGA . Thus, pmDHT was identified most likely as a new allele or at least a closely linked gene of the Pm5 locus.

"31633795","abstracttext","In Triticeae endosperm (e.g. wheat and barley), starch granules have a bimodal size distribution (with A- and B-type granules) whereas in other grasses the endosperm contains starch granules with a unimodal size distribution. Here, we identify the gene, BGC1 (B-GRANULE CONTENT 1), responsible for B-type starch granule content in Aegilops and wheat. Orthologues of this gene are known to influence starch synthesis in diploids such as rice, Arabidopsis, and barley. However, using polyploid Triticeae species, we uncovered a more complex biological role for BGC1 in starch granule initiation: BGC1 represses the initiation of A-granules in early grain development but promotes the initiation of B-granules in mid grain development. We provide evidence that the influence of BGC1 on starch synthesis is dose dependent and show that three very different starch phenotypes are conditioned by the gene dose of BGC1 in polyploid wheat: normal bimodal starch granule morphology; A-granules with few or no B-granules; or polymorphous starch with few normal A- or B-granules. We conclude from this work that BGC1 participates in controlling B-type starch granule initiation in Triticeae endosperm and that its precise effect on granule size and number varies with gene dose and stage of development."

"32705366","abstracttext","Puccinia triticina (P. triticina) is one of the most devastating fungal pathogens of wheat which causes significant annual yield loss to the crop. Understanding the gene regulatory mechanism of the biotrophic pathogen is one of the important aspects of host-pathogen interaction studies. Dicer-like genes are considered as important mediators of RNAi-based gene regulation. In this study, we report the presence of three Dicer-like genes (Pt-DCL1, Pt-DCL2, Pt-DCL3) in P. triticina genome identified through computational and biological analyses. Quantitative real-time PCR studies revealed an increase in the expression of these genes in germinating spore stages. Heterologous expression combined with mass spectrometry analysis of Pt-DCL2 confirmed the presence of a canonical Dicer-like gene in P. triticina. Phylogenetic analysis of the Pt-DCLs with the Dicer-like proteins from other organisms showed a distinct cluster of rust pathogens from the order Pucciniales. The results indicated a species-specific duplication of Dicer-like genes within the wheat rust pathogens. This study, for the first time, reports the presence of Dicer-dependent RNAi pathway in P. triticina that may play a role in gene regulatory mechanism of the pathogen during its development. Our study serves as a vital source of information for further RNAi-based molecular studies for better understanding and management of the wheat leaf rust disease."

"18808683","abstracttext_background","Wheat is a major crop in the world, and the high temperature stress can reduce the yield of wheat by as much as 15%. The molecular changes in response to heat stress are poorly understood. Using GeneChip Wheat Genome Array, we analyzed genome-wide gene expression profiles in the leaves of two wheat genotypes, namely, heat susceptible 'Chinese Spring' (CS) and heat tolerant 'TAM107' (TAM)."
"18808683","abstracttext_results","A total of 6560 (approximately 10.7%) probe sets displayed 2-fold or more changes in expression in at least one heat treatment (false discovery rate, FDR, alpha = 0.001). Except for heat shock protein (HSP) and heat shock factor (HSF) genes, these putative heat responsive genes encode transcription factors and proteins involved in phytohormone biosynthesis/signaling, calcium and sugar signal pathways, RNA metabolism, ribosomal proteins, primary and secondary metabolisms, as well as proteins related to other stresses. A total of 313 probe sets were differentially expressed between the two genotypes, which could be responsible for the difference in heat tolerance of the two genotypes. Moreover, 1314 were differentially expressed between the heat treatments with and without pre-acclimation, and 4533 were differentially expressed between short and prolonged heat treatments."
"18808683","abstracttext_conclusion","The differences in heat tolerance in different wheat genotypes may be associated with multiple processes and mechanisms involving HSPs, transcription factors, and other stress related genes. Heat acclimation has little effects on gene expression under prolonged treatments but affects gene expression in wheat under short-term heat stress. The heat stress responsive genes identified in this study will facilitate our understanding of molecular basis for heat tolerance in different wheat genotypes and future improvement of heat tolerance in wheat and other cereals."

"21761280","abstracttext","The assembly of a 1.3-Mb size region of the wheat genome has provided the opportunity to study a recent nuclear mitochondrial DNA insertion (NUMT). In the present study, we have studied two bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) and characterized a 52-kb NUMT segment from the tetraploid and hexaploid wheat BAC libraries. The conserved orthologous NUMT regions from tetraploid and hexaploid wheat Langdon and Chinese Spring shared identical gene haplotypes even though mutations (insertions, deletions, and substitutions) had occurred. The 52-kb NUMT was present in hexaploid variety Chinese Spring, but absent in variety Hope, by sequence comparison of their corresponding region. Amplifying the NUMT junctions using a set of the wheat materials including diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid lines showed that none of the diploid wheat carried the region and only some tetraploid and hexaploid wheat were positive for the NUMT. Age estimation of the NUMT displayed the mean ages of Langdon NUMT and Chinese Spring NUMT to be 378,000 and 416,000 years ago, respectively. Reverse transcription PCR and sequencing of the nad7 gene showed 28 C → U RNA editing sites and four partial editing sites, as expected for mitochondrial DNA expression. Specific SNPs discriminated between cDNA from the nucleus and the mitochondria and suggested that the nuclear copy was not expressed. The mitochondrial DNA studied was inserted into the genome quite recently within the wheat lineage and gave rise to the non-coding nuclear nad7 gene. The NUMT segment could be lost and acquired frequently during the wheat evolution."
"22361509","articletitle","Molecular cytogenetic characterization of wheat--Thinopyrum elongatum addition, substitution and translocation lines with a novel source of resistance to wheat Fusarium Head Blight."
"22361509","abstracttext","Thinopyrum elongatum (2n=2x=14, EE), a wild relative of wheat, has been suggested as a potentially novel source of resistance to several major wheat diseases including Fusarium Head Blight (FHB). In this study, a series of wheat (cv. Chinese Spring, CS) substitution and ditelosomic lines, including Th. elongatum additions, were assessed for Type II resistance to FHB. Results indicated that the lines containing chromosome 7E of Th. elongatum gave a high level of resistance to FHB, wherein the infection did not spread beyond the inoculated floret. Furthermore, it was determined that the novel resistance gene(s) of 7E was located on the short-arm (7ES) based on sharp difference in FHB resistance between the two 7E ditelosomic lines for each arm. On the other hand, Th. elongatum chromosomes 5E and 6E likely contain gene(s) for susceptibility to FHB because the disease spreads rapidly within the inoculated spikes of these lines. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) analysis revealed that the alien chromosomes in the addition and substitution lines were intact, and the lines did not contain discernible genomic aberrations. GISH and multicolor-GISH analyses were further performed on three translocation lines that also showed high levels of resistance to FHB. Lines TA3499 and TA3695 were shown to contain one pair of wheat-Th. elongatum translocated chromosomes involving fragments of 7D plus a segment of the 7E, while line TA3493 was found to contain one pair of wheat-Th. elongatum translocated chromosomes involving the D- and A-genome chromosomes of wheat. Thus, this study has established that the short-arm of chromosome 7E of Th. elongatum harbors gene(s) highly resistant to the spreading of FHB, and chromatin of 7E introgressed into wheat chromosomes largely retained the resistance, implicating the feasibility of using these lines as novel material for breeding FHB-resistant wheat cultivars."
"23117720","articletitle","Recent emergence of the wheat Lr34 multi-pathogen resistance: insights from haplotype analysis in wheat, rice, sorghum and Aegilops tauschii."
"23117720","abstracttext","Spontaneous sequence changes and the selection of beneficial mutations are driving forces of gene diversification and key factors of evolution. In highly dynamic co-evolutionary processes such as plant-pathogen interactions, the plant's ability to rapidly adapt to newly emerging pathogens is paramount. The hexaploid wheat gene Lr34, which encodes an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, confers durable field resistance against four fungal diseases. Despite its extensive use in breeding and agriculture, no increase in virulence towards Lr34 has been described over the last century. The wheat genepool contains two predominant Lr34 alleles of which only one confers disease resistance. The two alleles, located on chromosome 7DS, differ by only two exon-polymorphisms. Putatively functional homoeologs and orthologs of Lr34 are found on the B-genome of wheat and in rice and sorghum, but not in maize, barley and Brachypodium. In this study we present a detailed haplotype analysis of homoeologous and orthologous Lr34 genes in genetically and geographically diverse selections of wheat, rice and sorghum accessions. We found that the resistant Lr34 haplotype is unique to the wheat D-genome and is not found in the B-genome of wheat or in rice and sorghum. Furthermore, we only found the susceptible Lr34 allele in a set of 252 Ae. tauschii genotypes, the progenitor of the wheat D-genome. These data provide compelling evidence that the Lr34 multi-pathogen resistance is the result of recent gene diversification occurring after the formation of hexaploid wheat about 8,000 years ago."

"26044828","abstracttext_background","The gibberellin (GA) pathway plays a central role in the regulation of plant development, with the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2-ODDs: GA20ox, GA3ox, GA2ox) that catalyse the later steps in the biosynthetic pathway of particularly importance in regulating bioactive GA levels. Although GA has important impacts on crop yield and quality, our understanding of the regulation of GA biosynthesis during wheat and barley development remains limited. In this study we identified or assembled genes encoding the GA 2-ODDs of wheat, barley and Brachypodium distachyon and characterised the wheat genes by heterologous expression and transcript analysis."
"26044828","abstracttext_results","The wheat, barley and Brachypodium genomes each contain orthologous copies of the GA20ox, GA3ox and GA2ox genes identified in rice, with the exception of OsGA3ox1 and OsGA2ox5 which are absent in these species. Some additional paralogs of 2-ODD genes were identified: notably, a novel gene in the wheat B genome related to GA3ox2 was shown to encode a GA 1-oxidase, named as TaGA1ox-B1. This enzyme is likely to be responsible for the abundant 1β-hydroxylated GAs present in developing wheat grains. We also identified a related gene in barley, located in a syntenic position to TaGA1ox-B1, that encodes a GA 3,18-dihydroxylase which similarly accounts for the accumulation of unusual GAs in barley grains. Transcript analysis showed that some paralogs of the different classes of 2-ODD were expressed mainly in a single tissue or at specific developmental stages. In particular, TaGA20ox3, TaGA1ox1, TaGA3ox3 and TaGA2ox7 were predominantly expressed in developing grain. More detailed analysis of grain-specific gene expression showed that while the transcripts of biosynthetic genes were most abundant in the endosperm, genes encoding inactivation and signalling components were more highly expressed in the seed coat and pericarp."
"26044828","abstracttext_conclusions","The comprehensive expression and functional characterisation of the multigene families encoding the 2-ODD enzymes of the GA pathway in wheat and barley will provide the basis for a better understanding of GA-regulated development in these species. This analysis revealed the existence of a novel, endosperm-specific GA 1-oxidase in wheat and a related GA 3,18-dihydroxylase enzyme in barley that may play important roles during grain expansion and development."

"28653149","abstracttext_key message","Twenty-five Dasypyrum villosum 6V#4S-specific PCR markers were developed using transcriptome data and further assigned to comparative genomic maps of wheat chromosome 6A, 6B, and 6D and barley chromosome 6H contrasting their homologous genes in these genomes. Two Dasypyrum villosum accessions, D.v#2 and No. 1026 from England and Russia, respectively, contain Pm21 on chromosome 6V#2S and PmV on chromosome 6V#4S. Both genes confer high resistance to powdery mildew (PM) in wheat. Even though several molecular markers have been developed to detect Pm21 and PmV, only the MBH1 marker can simultaneously detect both Pm21 and PmV. In this study, we first used a high-throughput sequencing technique to obtain the transcriptome sequences of a wheat-D. villosum translocation line, Pm97033-which contains chromosome 6V#4S carrying the PmV locus, under wheat PM pathogen induction. Twenty-five 6V#4S chromosome-specific markers were developed. Three of them were able to clearly distinguish chromosomes 6V#4S and 6V#2S by product size, four amplified the product specific for chromosome 6V#4S only, and the remaining 18 markers identified chromosome 6VS in wheat backgrounds. Two different D. villosum accessions, their derived translocation lines and wheat varieties carrying different chromosome 6VS were identified using these specific markers. The 25 newly developed markers together with the known PM resistance gene Stpk-V were used to construct comparative genomic maps with the homoeologous chromosome arms of wheat and barley. The colinearity of the identified gene sequences amplified by the 25 markers among wheat chromosomes 6A, 6B, and 6D and barley chromosome 6H was not very conserved and interrupted frequently by inversion and insertion. Our markers have potential in marker assisted selection for PM resistance breeding, and for locating other potential important genes and cloning the PmV gene on chromosome 6V#4S."

"31003470","abstracttext","The 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductases (OPRs), which belong to the old yellow enzyme (OYE) family, are flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-dependent oxidoreductases with critical functions in plants. Despite the clear characteristics of growth and development, as well as the defense responses in Arabidopsis , tomato, rice, and maize, the potential roles of OPRs in wheat are not fully understood. Here, forty-eight putative OPR genes were found and classified into five subfamilies, with 6 in sub. I, 4 in sub. II, 33 in sub. III, 3 in sub. IV, and 2 in sub. V. Similar gene structures and conserved protein motifs of TaOPRs in wheat were identified in the same subfamilies. An analysis of cis-acting elements in promoters revealed that the functions of OPRs in wheat were mostly related to growth, development, hormones, biotic, and abiotic stresses. A total of 14 wheat OPR genes were identified as tandem duplicated genes, while 37 OPR genes were segmentally duplicated genes. The expression patterns of TaOPRs were tissue- and stress-specific, and the expression of TaOPRs could be regulated or induced by phytohormones and various stresses. Therefore, there were multiple wheat OPR genes, classified into five subfamilies, with functional diversification and specific expression patterns, and to our knowledge, this was the first study to systematically investigate the wheat OPR gene family. The findings not only provide a scientific foundation for the comprehensive understanding of the wheat OPR gene family, but could also be helpful for screening more candidate genes and breeding new varieties of wheat, with a high yield and stress resistance."

"30699539","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. tritici, is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat in the world. The Sichuan Basin is one of the most important regions of wheat production and stripe rust epidemics in China. Stripe rust resistance gene Yr26 (the same gene as Yr24) has been widely used in wheat breeding programs and in many cultivars grown in this region since the gene was discovered in the early 1990s. Virulence to Yr26 has increased in frequency since its first detection in 2008. The objective of this study was to assess the vulnerability of the wheat cultivars and breeding lines in the Sichuan Basin to Yr26-virulent races. In total, 85 wheat accessions were tested with Yr26-avirulent races CYR32, CYR33, and Su11-4 and two Yr26-virulent races, V26/CM42 and V26/Gui22. DNA markers for Yr26 were used to determine the presence and absence of Yr26 in the wheat accessions. Of the 85 wheat accessions, only 5 were resistant and 19 susceptible to all races tested, and the remaining 61 were resistant to at least one or more races tested in seedling stage. In all, 65 (76.5%) accessions were susceptible to the emerging Yr26-virulent race V26/Gui22. In field tests, susceptible accessions increased from 31.8% in a nursery inoculated with predominant and Yr26-avirulent races to 61.2% in the nursery inoculated with the predominant races mixed with V26/Gui22. Based on the results of the molecular marker and race tests, 33 (38.8%) accessions were determined to have Yr26, showing that the Yr26 virulence is a major threat to wheat production in the Sichuan Basin and potentially in other regions of China."

"30343385","abstracttext_key message","We detected the deletion breakpoints of wheat ph1b mutant and the actual size of the deletion. Also, we developed ph1b deletion-specific markers useful for ph1b-mediated gene introgression and genome studies. The Ph1 (pairing homoeologous) locus has been considered a major genetic system for the diploidized meiotic behavior of the allopolyploid genome in wheat. It functions as a defense system against meiotic homoeologous pairing and recombination in polyploid wheat. A large deletion of the genomic region harboring Ph1 on the long arm of chromosome 5B (5BL) led to the ph1b mutant in hexaploid wheat 'Chinese Spring,' which has been widely used to induce meiotic homoeologous recombination for gene introgression from wild grasses into wheat. However, the breakpoints and physical size of the deletion remain undetermined. In the present study, we first anchored the ph1b deletion on 5BL by the high-throughput wheat 90K SNP assay and then delimited the deletion to a genomic region of 60,014,523 bp by chromosome walking. DNA marker and sequence analyses detected the nucleotide positions of the distal and proximal breakpoints (DB and PB) of the ph1b deletion and the deletion junction as well. This will facilitate understanding of the genomic region harboring the Ph1 locus in wheat. In addition, we developed user-friendly DNA markers specific for the ph1b deletion. These new ph1b deletion-specific markers will dramatically improve the efficacy of the ph1b mutant in the meiotic homoeologous recombination-based gene introgression and genome studies in wheat and its relatives."

"32929630","abstracttext","Wheat contains the largest number of miR396 family with 17 miR396 in Poaceae. MiR396 regulatory network underlying wheat grain development has not comprehensively been explored. Our results showed that precursor miR396 family in Poaceae exhibited not only conservativeness but also diversification especially in wheat. Five haplotypes were detected in Poaceae species, while 4 haplotypes in wheat with Hap-4 (miR396a) and Hap-5 (miR396n) unique to wheat. GO enrichment analysis of target genes showed that the first 20 enrichment functions of miR396a and miR396n are completely different from each other, and also completely different from miR396(b-g), miR396(h-m), and miR396(o-q). Functional annotation on the 18 target genes shared by miR396(b-g), miR396(h-m), and miR396(o-q) found that 11 of the 18 target genes are growth-regulating factor (GRF) genes. Our results indicated that, during the grain filling stage of wheat, miR396 is involved in the development of grains by regulating the expression of GRF genes (GRF1, GRF6, and GRF9). Although the enrichment function of miR396(b-g), miR396(h-m), and miR396(o-q) is the same, the gene functional networks they formed differ greatly. Our results indicated that polyploidization enriches not only the diversity of miR396 family and its target genes but also gene functional networks in wheat. These results laid foundation for further elucidating function of miR396 gene family underlying wheat grain development."

"32729796","abstracttext","Leaf rust is an important wheat disease that is a significant hindrance for wheat production in most areas of the world. Breeding resistant cultivars can effectively and economically control the disease. In the present study, a wheat collection consisting of 100 cultivars from China and 18 improved germplasms from global landrace donors together with 36 known single Lr gene lines were tested with 20 strains of Puccinia triticina Eriks. in the seedling stage to postulate the Lr gene in the cultivars and germplasms. In addition, 12 diagnostic molecular markers specific to 10 Lr genes were used to detect the presence of the Lr genes in the wheat collection. Resistance to leaf rust of these cultivars at the adult plant stage was tested in fields under natural infection during the 2016 to 2018 cropping seasons in Baoding, Hebei Province. The gene postulation combined with molecular marker detection showed that six Lr genes ( Lr1 , Lr26 , Lr33 , Lr34 , Lr45 , and Lr46 ) were identified in 44 wheat accessions, including 37 cultivars and seven improved germplasms. Among the 44 wheat accessions postulated with Lr genes, Lr1 was present in four accessions, Lr26 in 12 accessions, Lr33 in two accessions, Lr34 in 14 accessions, Lr45 in three accessions, and Lr46 in 16 accessions. In the collection of 118 cultivars/germplasms, 34 wheat lines displayed adult-plant resistance carrying Lr34 , Lr46 , and/or underdetermined genes. Therefore, a high level of leaf rust resistance can be achieved through the combination of all-stage resistance and adult-plant resistance genes together in wheat cultivars."

A gene trap vector (U3Hygro) was used to target single-copy thymidine kinase (tk) genes, present at different sites in the genome. Cell populations isolated by gene trap selection contained a higher proportion of insertional mutants as compared with nonselected cells containing randomly integrated viruses. The number of integration events required to observe loss of gene function was reduced from 8-40 x 10(6) to 2-10 x 10(4), an overall enrichment of 100- to 1000-fold. The feasibility of targeting normally diploid genes was also demonstrated in hypodiploid Chinese hamster ovary cells. The cellular gene encoding GlcNAc transferase I was disrupted in one wheat germ agglutinin resistant clone selected from a total of 5 x 10(4) gene trap events. The clone was nullizygous for GlcNAc transferase I, indicating that the allele opposite the provirus was lost as a result of preexisting hemizygosity or by loss of heterozygosity. Finally, the total number of genes in the genome that could activate the expression of retrovirus gene traps was estimated at between 2 x 10(4) and 10(5), suggesting that most expressed genes can be mutagenized by gene trap selection."

The inheritance of resistance to each race has been determined from the F1 and F2 of the crosses (resistant parents with the susceptible variety, 'Agra Local') and F2 progenies from the backcross to 'Agra Local'. Tests have been performed to see if the two varieties carry common genes/s for resistance. The identity of the genes for resistance has been established from relevant crosses with single gene lines carrying known genes for resistance.A single dominant gene effective to race 15C in E5008 has been demonstrated to be Sr9b. Of the two recessive genes, each producing distinct infection types (0; and 1-3) against race 122, one gene has been inferred to be Sr12 and the second to be a hitherto undesignated gene.The resistance of E6160 against race 15C is controlled by two genes, one dominant and one recessive. The dominant gene has been identified as Sr9b. The recessive gene has been inferred to be a new gene. Similarly, a dominant gene effective against race 122 in E6160 has been observed to be different from those so far designated. In addition, the presence of modifier gene/s in the variety, E6160 has been suggested."

It is likely that difference of gene expression patterns between the cultivars (Mahuti as a salt tolerant cultivar and Alamut as a salt sensitive cultivar) is due to distinct signaling pathways which activate GSTF1 expression.

"29196985","abstracttext","Among the available reverse genetic approaches for studying gene function, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) has several advantages. It allows rapid characterization of gene function independent of stable transformation, which is basically difficult to achieve in monocots, and offers the potential to silence individual or multiple genes of a gene family. In order to establish a VIGS system in Aegilops tauschii, modified vectors derived from Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) were used for silencing a phytoene desaturase gene that provides a convenient visual reporter for silencing. The results demonstrated a high efficiency of BSMV-VIGS in A. tauschii. Moreover, the BSMV-VIGS system was used to target a 354 bp specific region of the Dehydration-responsive element-binding (AetDreb2) gene, resulting in successful silencing of the gene in A. tauschii plants, as verified by real-time qRT-PCR. Indeed, in comparison with plants that were inoculated with an empty vector (BSMV:00), a faster rate of wilting and a lower relative water content were observed in plants inoculated with BSMV:AetDreb2 when they were exposed to drought stress. Therefore, BSMV-VIGS can be efficiently employed as a novel tool for reverse genetics in A. tauschii. It can also be used to study the effects of polyploidization on the gene function by a comparative analysis between bread wheat and its diploid progenitor."

A 3.5 kb sequence 5' upstream of the ATG codon of the wheat FKBP73 was isolated from a wheat genomic library, and characterized by deletion analysis and transient expression in wheat embryos. The 1517 bp fragment is referred to as the full promoter due to the maximal activity of the fused luciferase reporter gene. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of three abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive elements (ABREs) proximal to coupling elements (CE1-like), a putative lectin box, two putative binding sites for the myb transcription factor and a 36 bp fragment which exhibits 100% identity to the pSau3A9 clone located in the centromeric region of wheat chromosomes. In a transient expression assay the promoter preserved the tissue specificity described in vivo, namely it is expressed only in germinating embryos and young shoots. The promoter was induced 1.9-fold by ABA, the minimal promoter was designated at -221 and the TATA box located at -137. The inducibility by ABA and the expression during germination may indicate that FKBP73 belongs to the group of genes induced by ABA upon germination."
